According to the locals, the shoot-out lasted for about 15 minutes.The thugs, according to eyewitnesses, overpowered the police officers and took off abandoning their vehicle at Natodome village in Bubirabi Sub County, two kilometres from the scene of crime.The Elgon Police Spokesperson, Mr Robert Tukei confirmed the incident and said one of the officers was killed in the shoot-out. The police officers engaged the robbers for about five minutes but it s unfortunate that during the battle, one of our officers lost his life,  he said.Mr Tukei only identified the deceased as Sgt/Detective Fred Chemongesi and the injured as Mukisa, Ikalati and Statalasi, all attached to Mbale Central Police station.  The body of the deceased has been taken to the mortuary for postmortem while the injured are currently admitted at Mbale regional referral hospital,  he said.According to Mr Tukei, the officers went after the robbers after they got information that they were trailing a businessman who was heading to Bududa District.The car in which suspected armed robbers were driving As it was approaching afternoon, we received a call that there were some robbers who trailing a businessman that is why our police officers went after them,  Mr Tukei said.The police spokesperson, however, revealed that the army had been contacted for reinforcement and joint manhunt for the thugs commenced. We are searching for the thugs and we know we are going to get them,  he said before adding that one of the suspected robbers sustained severe injuries.He also appealed to the locals to be on alert and report any suspicious person in the area.One of the police officers, who preferred anonymity, told Daily Monitor that the thugs were armed with two sub-machineguns. Our guns ran out of bullets and we had nothing to do but retreat,  he said.The source added that the commanders at the Mbale central police station also delayed to send reinforcement. Our commanders delayed to send more manpower at the scene. They were just calling us on phone instead of sending reinforcement,  he said.Mr Robert Masangha, a resident and eye witness said after overpowering police, the thugs drove their vehicle and parked it for almost 30 minutes at Natodome village, trying to replace the deflated tyre but they failed and abandoned it there. We saw only four police officers in pursuit and reinforcement delayed to arrive. They would have caught them,  he said. If it was [former presidential candidate] Dr Kizza Besigye or [Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi] Bob Wine coming to Mbale town, they would have deployed heavily but now look, they left the thugs to go scot-free,  Ms Grace Namono, another resident said.By press time, heads of security in Elgon region were in the emergency meeting to forge a way forward.

1,South Sudan's Kiir warns against 'violent attempts to usurp power' - Daily Monitor,"South Sudan's President Salva Kiir said Wednesday that any attempt to forcibly seize power in the country would be met with ""violent resistance"", as calls for his ouster spread on social media.In the past two weeks, a new group calling itself the Red Card Movement has been circulating calls online for a protest on Thursday with the hashtags #KiirMustGo and #SouthSudanUprising, with organisers appearing to be based mostly in the diaspora.The movement appears to be inspired by street protests in neighbouring Sudan which led to the toppling of veteran president Omar al-Bashir.""Violent attempts to usurp power from the people would be met with violent resistance and the cycle of violence cannot end,"" Kiir told a press briefing.""The way to stability in South Sudan is through democracy and democratic elections, and this is what we fought for and we will not compromise it,"" Kiir said.Since last week security on the streets of Juba has been beefed up. However officials have said this was unrelated to the planned protests, but was in preparation for a public holiday Thursday celebrating those who took up arms in the fight for independence from Sudan, achieved in 2011.Army spokesman Major-General Lul Ruai Koang told AFP that the celebrations had been postponed by a week for ""final touches"" to preparations.""The security deployment and all sorts of security arrangements (are) to provide maximum security and safety for the people during the celebrations,"" he added.Independent radio station Eye Radio reported Wednesday that some Juba residents had woken up to security officers going house to house searching for guns.South Sudanese activist Keluel Agok, now living in Kampala, is among those calling for the protests.""If you want to an end the impunity please come out on 16th May 2019 to restore liberty, justice and unity in South Sudan,"" he wrote on Facebook Tuesday.South Sudan plunged into civil war in 2013 after Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar of plotting a coup against him.The war has left 380,000 people dead and forced more than four million South Sudanese -- almost a third of the population -- to flee their homes.A peace deal signed in September 2018 has largely stopped fighting, but implementation has run aground and the planned formation of a unity government on May 12 was postponed for six months.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/South-Sudan-s-Kiir-warns-against--violent-attempts-usurp-power-/688334-5118544-14n2idsz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post1.png
2,Sudan protesters vow to press on after talks suspended - Daily Monitor,"Sudanese protesters voiced regret Thursday at an army decision to suspend crucial talks on installing civilian rule but vowed to press on with a sit-in despite being targeted in fresh violence.Army generals and protest leaders had been expected to come to an agreement on Wednesday over the make-up of a new body to govern Sudan for three years.The issue is the thorniest to have come up in ongoing talks on reinstating civilian rule after the generals took over following the ouster of longtime autocratic president Omar al-Bashir last month.But in the early hours of Thursday, the chief of Sudan's ruling military council, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, announced the talks had been suspended for 72 hours as security in Khartoum had deteriorated.He demanded that protesters dismantle roadblocks in Khartoum, open bridges and railway lines connecting the capital and ""stop provoking security forces"".The Alliance for Freedom and Change, the group that is leading the protest movement and negotiating the transfer of power with the army rulers, called the move ""regrettable"".""It ignores the developments achieved in negotiations so far... and the fact that Wednesday's meeting was to finalise the agreement, which would have stopped the escalations such as roadblocks.""The protest movement vowed to press on with the ""sit-in outside the army headquarters and across the country"".- Several roadblocks removed -Protesters said the army aimed to provoke demonstrators.""They want to provoke the people by delaying the negotiations ... but the negotiations will resume now that the roadblocks have been removed,"" said Moatassim Sayid, a protester at the sit-in.On Thursday morning, several roadblocks in downtown Khartoum had been taken down, an AFP correspondent reported, adding that troops from the paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF) were deployed in some areas.Roadblocks on key thoroughfares in the capital are being used by demonstrators to pressure the generals to transfer power to a civilian administration.The talks began on Monday and achieved significant breakthroughs, but have also been marred by violence that left five protesters and an army major dead and many wounded from gunshots.Protesters allege that members of RSF were behind the violence.But Burhan said there were ""armed elements among demonstrators who were shooting at security forces.""He defended the paramilitary group, saying ""it had taken the side of the people"" during the uprising that toppled Bashir on April 11.The British ambassador to Khartoum said Sudanese security forces had fired at protesters on Wednesday when eight were reported wounded near the sit-in, where thousands remain camped demanding the generals step down.""Extremely concerned by use of live ammunition by Sudanese security forces against protesters in Khartoum today, with reports of civilian casualties,"" Irfan Siddiq wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.""Military council must act to stop this now. No more excuses."" US blames generals Washington blamed the military council for the bloodshed that left six dead on Monday.""The tragic attacks on protesters ... were clearly the result of the Transitional Military Council trying to impose its will on the protesters by attempting to remove roadblocks,"" the US embassy said in a statement.The protest movement said the generals wanted the demonstrators to restrict themselves to the sit-in area.Protesters are demanding a civilian-led transition, which the generals have steadfastly resisted since bowing to their demands and toppling Bashir.During the first two days of talks the two sides had agreed on an overall civilian structure, including a three-year transitional period for the full transfer of power to a civilian administration.They had also agreed that parliament be composed of 300 members for the transition, with around two-thirds from the alliance and the rest drawn from other political groups.The make-up of the new sovereign council has been the toughest part of the negotiations, with the two sides so far proposing different compositions of the body which is expected to take all key decisions concerning national issues.The generals want it to be military-led, while the protesters insist on a majority civilian body.General Yasser al-Atta, one of the members of the current ruling military council, had vowed earlier this week to reach a deal by Thursday that ""meets the people's aspirations"".The new council is expected to form a transitional civilian government, which would then prepare for the first post-Bashir election after the three-year changeover period ends.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Sudan-protesters-vow-to-press-after-talks-suspended/688334-5118460-pp4htl/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post2.png

7,Bukenya s wife files for divorce - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The wife of Prof Gilbert Bukenya, Dr Margaret Mary Musoke, has filed for divorce, accusing the former vice president of abandoning his marital obligations, which has irretrievably shuttered their marriage.In the divorce suit filed in the Family Division of the High Court at Makindye on May 7, Dr Musoke contends that Prof Bukenya deserted their matrimonial home and engaged in incidents of adultery and infidelity.    in the course of the marriage, the respondent (Bukenya) has deserted your petitioner (Dr Margaret Mary Musoke Bukenya) at the family/matrimonial home, engaged in endless instances of adultery and infidelity and subjected your petitioner to endless distress and abuse amounting to cruelty,  Dr Musoke states in the suit documents. She is represented by Ligomarc Advocates. In the suit, Dr Musoke states that she lawfully married Prof Bukenya on September 21, 1974 at St Augustine Chapel, Makerere University, and that the marriage was solemonised in accordance with the Marriage Act.She contends that in 1982/83, Prof Bukenya repeatedly committed adultery with Ms Teddy Ndagire, which resulted in the birth of a son, Capt Brian Bukenya. Capt Bukenya, who was working with the elite presidential guard Special Forces Command, died in November 2009. According to particulars of the divorce suit, Prof Bukenya from the late 1990s had several other extra-marital affairs with other women, among them late Stella Njuba and Margaret Kabasinguzi Nyabongo, who was his mobiliser, and Jamila Nakku. The respondent (Bukenya) has had several other extra marital affairs, which have been highly publicised in the media much in my shame and ridicule. These women, among others, include a popular musician, Ms Irene Namubiru, and Princess Sheila Nvanungi, among others,  she states.Singer Irene Namubiru and Prof Gilbert BukenyaDr Musoke contends that she has been a witness to some of the extra-marital affairs and despite confronting her husband on the issues, Prof Bukenya has not been repentant or shown himself willing to desist from the ridiculous and demeaning behaviour.  The respondent has not spent a night at the family home in Ntinda since July 2012. Before that, he would only visit briefly in October 2011 to attend mass following his release from prison. Since July 2012, he has only visited once in May 2015,  she contends.Abandoning homeDr Musoke further states that Prof Bukenya stopped giving any support to the family and as a result, the guards assigned to her as spouse of the former vice president were later withdrawn for her inability to provide them food and other amenities. The respondent has for the last 10 years taken residence at another country home at Garuga, Katomi where he is known to host scandalous sensual parties, including the infamous bikini parties with young girls and city socialites, much to the embarrassment of your petitioner and her family,  Dr Musoke states.According to the complaint, as a result of the numerous extra- marital affairs, Dr Bukenya has had to constantly endure the agony of not only undergoing HIV and STD tests but also worrying about her safety in light of the claims from other women that her husband is theirs. That your petitioner has had the challenge of raising her children in a healthy and safe environment despite the toxic setting resulting from the respondent s aggressive and public behaviour,  Prof Bukenya s wife further contends.Bukenya and Princess Sheila NvanungiEfforts to get a comment from Prof Bukenya were futile as his known mobile telephone number was not available by press time.He is expected to file his defence against the suit within 15 days from receipt of court summons. We have, however, not established whether he has received the summons or not. Prof Bukenya is also former MP for Busiro North.BackgroundRecent case.

Kenyan police spokesman Charles Owino said he had no such information.Several sources said the doctors were believed to be providing medical services in Somalia. They were part of a group of about 100 Cubans who went to Kenya last year to boost health services there.Kenyan police sources said the kidnapping bore the hallmarks of Al-Shabaab, a militant outfit that has been waging an insurgency against Somalia's foreign-backed government for over a decade.Last November, an armed gang seized Silvia Romano, 23, an Italian charity worker, in the southeastern Kenyan town of Chakama. Her whereabouts are unknown.Police at the time warned against any speculation that Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda affiliate, may have been involved in her abduction.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Kidnappers-demand--1-5-million-Cuban-doctors-taken-Kenya/688340-5118092-11eg768/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post9.png

The Speaker of Parliament, Ms Rebecca Kadaga has pledged support to the Uganda Parliamentary Press Association (UPPA) Savings and Credits Cooperative Society (SACCO) as a way of improving their welfare.The Speaker made the pledge Thursday morning during a meeting with UPPA members, the first interaction she has had with journalists since her return from medication at Aga Khan Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya a few weeks ago. On the issue of the SACCO, we are going to do something about it. We have been supporting Rotary as part of Cooperate Social Responsibility as parliament,  she said.The Speaker said she needs three-months-time to engage with the Parliamentary Commission on how financial support can be extended to the UPPA SACCO.Ms Kadaga was responding to a request made by the UPPA president Mr Moses Mulondo who said the SACCO has been fully registered but needed support from Parliament.Mr Mulondo said the welfare of journalists is wanting with some earning a monthly pay of as little as Shs100, 000. Journalists are poorly paid in their media houses here in Uganda. Many are paid around Shs100, 000 per month which exposes them to extortions. So as UPPA we request for an annual contribution to the SACCO,  he said.Mr Mulondo also expressed a need for parliament to involve journalists in doing research and pay them allowances in return. He also requested the Speaker to find a spacious room with parliament as the current press office cannot accommodate the 265 journalists accredited to cover parliament.The room has a sitting capacity of 17 people with only seven computers something that causes a lot of queues for journalists to file their stories.In her response, Ms Kadaga promised to visit the press office soon before she takes the matter to the parliamentary commission.The speaker also criticised journalists for pre-empting committee reports by speaking to individual Members of Parliament hence the public taking their opinions as decision of parliament. Don t take personal opinions of MPs as decisions of parliament. Sometimes you pre-empt committee reports before they are presented in the house for us to have debate and take decisions,  she said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kadaga-to-inject-money-journalists-SACCO/688334-5118106-hg066nz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post10.png

The Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA), has condemned the theft and dismantling of its weather equipment across the country by people who think the gadgets contain mercury underneath.Mr Godfrey Mujuni, a data manager at UNMA, on Tuesday said there are some unpatriotic members of the public who are making their weather forecasting hard, despite the Authority making strides in improving the quality of weather data.

We pray that special economic zones should be demarcated with some of the industries be directed to Bunyoro region through the investment sector,  the petition adds.The President also met the Omukama of Bunyoro Kitara at Karuziika palace in Hoima Town where they discussed a range of social-economic issues.The Bunyoro-Kitara Kingdom Prime Minister, Mr Andrew Byakutaga, said the kingdom requested the President to return all the kingdom s reinstituted properties. The President accepted our request and he promised to come on June 10 to sign a memorandum of understanding with the king and also be the chief guest on June 11 at the Omukama s coronation silver jubilee celebrations,  Mr Byakutaga said.The kingdom further requested government to operationalise the proposed Bunyoro University with its main campus in Hoima District.While addressing a rally at Kyatiri playground in Masindi District yesterday, the President announced that starting next financial year, he will initiate a fund for each zone to benefit organised groups doing skilling activities such as food processing, cooking stoves, hair dressing, and saloons. He said other funds would support Saccos.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Bunyoro-demands-affirmative-action/688334-5118220-hjy7fn/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post17.png
14,Kitagwenda MP escapes jail over Shs16m debt - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The Kitagwenda County MP in Kamwenge District, Mr Abbas Mugisha Agaba, yesterday survived jail for failure to pay a Shs16m debt.Mr Agaba was arrested by bailiffs on orders of the High Court s Execution Division Registrar, Mr Deo Ninzeyimana.The bailiffs arrested the legislator, who subscribes to the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), at Buganda Road Chief Magistrate s Court where he had gone to answer another case.Mr Agaba was presented before court presided over by Mr Ninzeyimana where he paid Shs10m in cash and signed a postdated cheque of Shs6.5 million before he was released.According to the warrant of arrest, Mr Agaba was adjudged by court in March 2016 to pay fellow MP Herbert Kabafunzaki, Shs15.5m he acquired from the latter as a loan.Arrest warrant These are to command you to arrest Mr Agaba, the judgement debtor unless the judgement debtor pays to you the sum of Shs15,513,511 together with Shs . for costs of executing this process, to bring the said Mr Agaba before the court with all convenient speed,  reads the court arrest order.In a telephone interview, Mr Agaba denied the arrest and insisted the case was settled. I was in court today for another matter, which already exists, and the issue of Kabafunzaki was some time ago but I am wondering where you got this from,  he said yesterday.Two months ago, 39-year-old Agaba was taken to court and charged with obtaining more than Shs100m by false pretence.Prosecution contends that Mr Agaba and others still at large between August 2016 and June 2017 in Lugogo, Kampala, fraudulently obtained Shs90 million from one George Patrick Kasajja purporting that the MP would represent him in court as an advocate and obtained Shs20m again from the same person on June 2, 2017 at Caf  Mocca along Dewinton Road in Kampala for the same purported reason.Mr Agaba denied all the charges but he was released on bail after depositing in court Shs2m cash.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kitagwenda-MP-escapes-jail-over-Shs16m-debt/688334-5118232-e6j6ohz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post18.png
15,"Doctors decry heavy workload, shortages in public hospitals - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Specialist medical doctors from different fields such as paediatrics, oncology and neurosurgery have asked government to attract and train more staff to lighten their workload.There are only 1,530 specialists of the 6,290 medical and dental practitioners in the country, according to records from the Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council (UMDPC).As a result, Dr John Ssekabira, the president of the Association of Surgeons of Uganda, said there a huge backlog of surgical cases in the country because the few specialists are overwhelmed, which compromises the quality of healthcare.   Recently, the World Health Assembly [decision-making body of WHO] observed that surgical conditions such as cancer and trauma contribute more than HIV and malaria to mortality and so the surgical burden needs to be addressed to reduce the burden,  Dr Ssekabira yesterday.He was speaking at a press conference organised by the College of Surgeons of East, Central, and Southern Africa (COSECSA), an independent body that fosters post-graduate education in sub-Saharan Africa. COSECSA will hold their 20th examinations and scientific conference in Uganda in November.BlameDr Joel Kiryabwire, the president of the Neurosurgical Society of Uganda (NSU), added that the problem of heavy workload is accelerated by the fact that  we don t train super specialists in our universities and those few who have managed to train have had to pay for themselves yet it takes a long period of time, which creates a very big surgical burden . COSECSA offers a cheaper opportunity for medical doctors to train in different areas of specialty such as neurosurgery from locally accredited hospitals both in their countries of origin and the region.The non-profit organisation currently operates in 10 countries; Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

16,Expectant women deliver on mats in Tororo hospital - Daily Monitor,"TORORO. Expectant women admitted to Tororo main hospital have resorted to delivering on the floor on mats due to a shortage of beds in the maternity ward. We come with our own mats to deliver because we are told the beds are not enough but we cannot blame the midwives because they try doing everything possible to deliver us safely. They are also constrained,  Ms Jane Omongi, a resident of Western Division in Tororo Municipality, said on Tuesday.Ms Joan Ochieng, another expectant woman, asked government to equip the maternity ward with beds and other essentials. Government should equip the maternity wing to protect our dignity as mothers, especially when we are delivering,  she said.Ms Grace Atim, the officer-in- charge of the maternity ward, told Daily Monitor, that the labour suite has only six worn-out beds.She said about 18 women deliver daily on average and more than 400 in a month. This is challenging and sometimes we are forced to [help women] deliver from the floor, which is unhygienic but we have no option,  Ms Atim said. Government should refurbish the maternity ward to attract mothers to deliver from this health facility,  she added.The State Minister for Health in-charge of General Duties, Ms Sarah Opendi, said the beds in the maternity ward were enough. The maternity wing has six beds and all are functional. People should know that women do not deliver at the same time,  Ms Opendi said.A 2017 Sauti wa Wanachi survey by Twaweza, a non-governmental organisation, indicates that 59 per cent of Ugandans think poor health facilities top the country s problems followed by high cost of living (38 per cent) and unemployment (33 per cent). Ms Judith Isuka, a midwife, said they are unable to give mothers proper care due to the sorry state of the ward.  Due to shortage of beds, some women in labour are compelled to sit on benches or lie on the floor as they wait for some of their colleagues to be discharged before they are given a bed,  she said, adding that sometimes they are forced to discharge mothers shortly after delivery. It is not recommended because this puts their lives at risk of developing other health complications,  Ms Isuka said. Mr Walter Oryekwun, the hospital administrator, said the bed capacity had been planned in accordance with the then small population, but it has tripled. Currently, the facility serves expectant mothers from all the neighbouring districts and part of Western Kenya,  he said.Mr John Francis Olwenyi, the district vice chairperson, said the hospital needs renovation.Ms Samali Sabano Epiat, the assistant chief administrative officer, said the hospital also has few staff.Mr Fredrick Epiat, the chairperson of Rock Classic Health Club, recently organised a marathon to raise money for new beds at the health facility.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Expectant-women-deliver-mats-Tororo-hospital/688334-5116902-ngb7yg/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post20.png
17,Sugar Bill should be fair to all players - Busoga MPs - Daily Monitor,"JINJA. A section of MPs from Busoga Sub-region have expressed their frustration at the Sugar Bill, saying it is discriminative. The Bill was reintroduced on the floor of Parliament last month following its rejection by President Museveni on grounds that  it did not address the concerns of big manufacturers.  He asked Parliament to reconsider and provide zoning of sugarcane growing and production.In the Bill, government had proposed zoning of a 25-kilometre radius between mills, with not more than one mill in the zone.In separate phone interviews on Tuesday, some legislators called for amendment of some of the clauses in the Bill.Jinja Municipality MP Paul Mwiru (FDC) said any effort to regulate the sugar industry must be intended to regulate, not distort the sector. When you talk about the big players, you realise that outgrowers are the big stakeholders controlling almost 1.2 million tonnes of cane, Kakira Sugar Factory 400,000 tonnes and others none,  Mr Mwiru said. I don t downplay the importance of the big-player in the sector because they contribute more than Shs300b but government must strike a balance between the big companies  interests and those of the outgrowers,   he added.Mr Robert Musoke ( Budiope West, NRM), said the zoning policy should be scrapped because Uganda is a liberalised economy. Zoning creates a monopoly for one miller which infringes on the rights of the (sugarcane) outgrowers,   Mr Musoke said.Mr Moses Walyomu ( Kagoma, NRM) said before the establishment of small factories, prices of sugarcane were as low as Shs26,000 compared to the current Shs128,000, warning that zoning will also affect employment opportunities in the industry in the region.Mr James Waira Kyewalabye Majegere (Bunya East, NRM) said zoning should not be reinstated in the Bill because it will affect many Ugandans who are earning from the factories that are likely to be relocated. If Mayuge Sugar Factory is relocated, it will affect the income of those directly and indirectly benefiting from it. The only thing they can do is not to allow a new factory in the area, which is already congested,   he said.Mr Majegere said government should also allow free movement of sugarcane so that farmers can have unlimited access and market for their products.Mr Moses Kizige (Bugabula North NRM), the State minister for Karamoja Affairs, said the NRM Caucus has already taken a position on the Bill which he did not divulge.Speaker Rebecca Kadaga, also the Kamuli Woman MP, urged all legislators from sugarcane-growing areas to take a stand and not to betray their voters  interests by acting like  mafias. Last month, Parliament granted one month to government for consultations following a request from its Chief Whip, Ms Ruth Nankabirwa.BackgroundBusoga Sub-region has five sugar factories, including Kakira Sugar Works in Jinja, Mayuge Sugar Factory, GM Sugar in Buikwe District, Kamuli Sugar Limited in Kamuli District and Kaliro Sugar Limited in Kaliro District. According to a report of the Committee of Trade, Tourism and Industry on the Sugar Bill, since government had already licensed millers, it would cost Shs50b to relocate the factories outside the 25-kilometre radius.This cost would cover civil works, dismantling and re-erecting, transportation and commission.Sugarcane farmers are opposed to zoning on account that it will make them lose market for their sugarcane since there will not be competition for the canes.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Sugar-Bill-should-be-fair-all-players-Busoga-MPs/688334-5116930-oqgviiz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post21.png
18,Oulanyah halts eviction on disputed Apaa land - Daily Monitor,"Gulu. The Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Mr Jacob Oulanyah, has asked government to stop any form of eviction on Apaa land pending further investigation into the contentious land bordering Adjumani and Amuru districts.His directives comes just days after President Museveni appointed him chairperson of a new committee tasked with finding a durable solution to Apaa land conflict.Halted evictionsMr Oulanyah said government should stay any eviction if at all they are happening now so that better avenues are found to move people outside the conservation area.Last week, Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) rangers, accompanied by police and Adjumani District local government officials, closed Apaa Market, leaving more than 1,500 vendors stranded in a move aimed at consolidating the East Madi Wildlife Game Reserve. If any eviction activity is going on in Apaa, it should stop now until further communication on what we should do with the movement of the people to get outside the conservation area so that there is smooth handling of the process,  Mr Oulanyah said.He made the statement while briefing the reconstituted Apaa land committee members at his boardroom at Parliament on Tuesday. Present at the meeting were Prime Minister Dr Ruhakana Rugunda, Lands Minister Betty Amongi, Disaster Preparedness and Refugee Minister Hillary Onek, First Deputy Prime Minister Moses Ali, Minister in charge of Water and Environment Ephraim Kamuntu and Grace Freedom Kwiyucwiny, the Northern Uganda State Minister.Mr Oulanyah told the committee that in their recent engagement with Dr Rugunda, they found out there was need to handle the Apaa land issue with finality because previous efforts to try and bring it to conclusion have failed. We have been tasked to look at what is going on in Apaa to see if we can come out with some recommendation on how implementation of decisions that have been made or decision that can be changed or whatever we can find to make the implementation of eventually clearing the conservation area possible and smooth without affecting people,  he said.Mr Oulanyah also asked that in the interim period, there should be no more movement for settlement into Apaa area, including both Zoka and Apaa itself, which has been confirmed to be in a conservation area.He called for calm from all the affected parties.He also noted that as part of plans to sensitize the community on their new roles, they will have a radio talk show on Thursday that will be relayed on all radio stations within the affected region.BackgroundEviction. Last week, government announced that it had given final orders to the locals settled on the gazetted East Madi Wildlife Reserve in Apaa to vacate, sparking off outcry from locals and leaders in the region.

19,Wildlife attacks on locals worries UWA - Daily Monitor,"Oyam. The growing incidents of wildlife attacks of residents in the country is worrying Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA). Mr Charles Tumwesigye, the UWA director of operations, said during a community meeting with residents of Kamdini Sub-county on Tuesday that the animal raids and killing of people outside gazetted wildlife facilities across the country is disastrous.Mr Tumwesigye observed that cases of human deaths arising from stray elephant attacks had become rampant yet they cannot do much as UWA because they are overwhelmed.The meeting was organised by UWA.  This problem of human-wildlife conflict is now a national disaster. Kamdini area is just one part. Your neighbours in Apala B up to Pakwach bridge, all that area is a hot spot for human-wildlife conflict with elephants, buffaloes and lions,  he said.He added:  As UWA, we don t like to see the people suffering, we really feel the pain you go through, but as we talk, even here in Kafu, we have lost about six people to crocodiles. In Lake Victoria, several people have been eaten by crocodiles and it is a very big problem. During the meeting, locals tasked UWA to compensate them for the loss of more than 17 people killed by elephants in the sub-county in the past one year.They said the most affected were residents of Kamdini, Aber and Loro sub-counties in Oyam District by wildlife from the neighbouring Murchison National Park.Mr Tumwesigye said UWA does not have enough manpower, resources and equipment to enhance its operations in order to avert human-wildlife conflict.He said currently, there is a boom in elephant population across national parks of Uganda, although the number of rangers and scouts deployed by the authority has remained low to handle the big number.  Recently, President Museveni passed out 490 rangers and Murchison Falls Park got only 70 of them,  Mr Tumwesigye added.He revealed that UWA manages 11 per cent of Uganda s total area, with only 2,000 staff (1,700 of which are rangers). The number cannot adequately deploy to smoothly run operations across all the 40 protected facilities run by UWA.He, however, said UWA has embarked on a process of installing a 10km-stretch of electric fence around Queen Elizabeth National Park, and will soon install another 5km-electric fence in Oyam and Nwoya along their borderlines with Murchison Falls National Park.  The lives of people are very important to us more than the animals, we plan to do this very soon in order to holistically address this problem because it is affecting the livelihoods of so many people,  Mr Wilson Kagoro, the UWA community conservation warden for Karuma, said.Mr Kagoro noted that UWA staff at Wangkwar gate in Nwoya District are testing drones, a new technology to repel elephants once they stray into the community.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Wildlife-attacks-locals-worries-UWA/688334-5116968-14jw0n1/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post23.png
20,"Nakaseke s industrial park, business hub take shape - Daily Monitor","NAKASEKE. When Nakaseke District Council endorsed a proposal to have some portion of their land in Kapeeka Sub-county allocated for the establishment of an industrial park in 2010, the only known features in the location were perhaps the mass graves and maize gardens. Gen Salim Saleh, the coordinator of Operation Wealth Creation, was then actively engaging farmers in commercial maize growing.Today, the area is quickly turning into an industrial park with many activities.Located about 55kms from Uganda s Capital Kampala and about 41kms off the busy Kampala- Gulu Highway, the mushrooming residential area is an indicator of a fast growing town.There are also more than 15 industries producing items ranging from electronics, grains, fruit processing and packaging.The Industrial Park Zone, according to Nakaseke District leaders, stretches to four out of the five parishes of Kapeeka Sub-county and covers more than two square miles.Mr Ignatius Kiwanuka Koomu, the Nakaseke District chairperson, said:  It is very true Kapeeka is not only a dreamland for the people of Nakaseke, but a fast growing business hub after the successful commissioning of more than 15 industries producing different commodities and employing more than 2,000 Ugandans. Recently, the district council endorsed a proposal to have the town upgraded to a municipality status and the matter is currently before Ministry of Local Government.While both the district and sub-county authorities say more than 15,000 Ugandans have got jobs at the newly established factories, Mr Lui Ming Shu, the director of the Liao Shen Industrial park, a consortium of the more than 15 Chinese owned factories at the park, recently told President Museveni and guests that the factories employ about 2,000 Ugandans.Passing resolutionSensing the effects of destroying environment as a result of constructing factories and the cutting of trees for both charcoal and timber by residents, the district council in 2017 passed a resolution for the creation of a green belt at both the industrial park and the urban areas. The district teamed up with the management at the industrial park to have more than 2,000 trees planted.Mr Richard Ssendege, a farmer at Nalumunye Village in Kapeeka Sub-county, is among the beneficiaries of the fruit factory where he sales his mangoes and gets residue he uses as manure on his farm.Nakaseke South Member of Parliament Paul Lutamaguzi says although the industrial park has changed the face of the former remote village in terms of infrastructure, a section of residents are threatened with eviction from their land yet they are expected to grow food that will feed workers and also provide fruits to the fruit factory.StatisticsNakaseke is part of Luweero Triangle, which was the epicentre of the five-year guerrilla war that ushered Mr Museveni s government to power into 1986.While the 2014 National Housing and Population Census puts the population of Kapeeka Sub-county at 40,117, authorities estimate the population to have shot to 43,000 as a result of continued influx of workers at the factories.Figures from the 2014 national census showed that 58 per cent of the population in the productive age bracket of between 14 and 64 years, about 10.4 million people, is unemployed. While a 2017 Sauti wa Wananchi by Twaweza, a non-governmental organasitation, shows that 78 per cent of Ugandans felt government was not doing well in creating jobs.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Nakaseke-s-industrial-park-business-hub-take-shape/688334-5116976-mkjabvz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post24.png
21,Museveni commissions Hoima Town roads - Daily Monitor,"KAYUNGA. President Museveni on Tuesday commissioned 12 roads in Hoima Municipality that were constructed under the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development (USIMID) programme.The roads, situated in the heart of Hoima Town, cover 6 Kilometres and were upgraded from murram to tarmac.The municipality mayor, Ms Grace Mary Mugasa, appreciated the President and the NRM government for improving urban infrastructure.She said the municipality started implementing USMID projects in 2013 and so far, government has injected Shs31 billion in the municipality.The money, she said, has been used in constructing roads, capacity building for technical staff, local revenue enhancement, establishment of a material testing laboratory, physical planning, beautification and street lighting in the town.The USMID coordinator, Dr Isaac Mutenyo, said Kasese, Kamuli, Mubende, Kitgum, Lugazi, Busia, Ntungamo and Apac municipalities will benefit from financing.The programme worth $360 million will benefit 22 municipalities and eight districts that host a large number of refugees. Dr Mutenyo says Hoima is likely to receive about Shs50 billion under the USMID additional financing, which will be implemented from the 2018/2019 financial year to the 2022/2023 financial year.While addressing the residents, Mr Museveni said government has not forgotten improving urban infrastructure.  We had many priorities which we were still working on,  he said.He said even as God created the world, he did not do everything at once. He said NRM uses prioritisation while implementing its programmes.He added that after opening up main roads linking regions and districts, government has now started improving urban infrastructure and other key roads. We are doing all this before oil production. When we start producing oil, we shall do a lot more,  the President said.The President urged civil servants to be trustworthy and use government money for the intended purpose. Mr Museveni later met Bunyoro regional leaders at Kontik Hotel in Hoima Town.

22,Police hunt for man who impregnated P.6 girl with triplets - Daily Monitor,"KAMULI.Police in Kamuli District in eastern Uganda have launched a manhunt for the father of triplets who were born to a Primary Six girl, with the possibility of charging him with defilement, the Busoga North Police Spokesperson, Mr Michael Kasadha has said.The girl, a pupil of Nawandyo Primary School in Nawandyo Village, Bugulumbya Sub-county in Kamuli District, whose names have not been disclosed because she is a minor, last week gave birth by normal delivery to a girl and two boys at Kamuli mission hospital.Hospital records suggest that the  father of the triplets  is Joshua Baya, a shamba boy who is also reported to have cleared the bill. The girl has, however, only named the triplets  father as  Joshua , saying that she doesn t recall his second name!Mr Kasadha on Wednesday said the pupil was defiled and the moment they find her parents, they will follow-up on the matter.READ: Teenage student delivers triplets I am going to find out if the case was reported; but it is possible that she gave birth without a report being filed against her. This is because the would-be stakeholders keep quiet because they want money. These are some of the challenges we are facing,  he said.Ms Kevin Magoba, the in-charge maternity ward, said the girl delivered normally on May 5 and was discharged on May 7.  The babies were premature (seven months) and the mother had eclampsia. The first baby was weak and couldn t suck well and had to be admitted and discharged after three days. All the babies were weighing 1.9 kilograms and are all in a good condition including the mother. The mother had a heavy breath but it was also controlled,  she said.A report which was released by the district health department showed that 7,000 teenage deliveries were recorded last year but only 300 cases were reported to police,  Mr Kasadha said.The Kamuli District Annual Deliveries report which was recently released by Mr Moses Lyagoba, the Assistant Kamuli District Health Officer in-charge of maternal child health, shows that out of 35,509 deliveries in 2018, 7,070 were teenage deliveries.These figures, generated from annual reports from the district health office, exclude unreported cases of abortion and deliveries outside the 47 health centres within the District, Mr Lyagoba added.According to Mr Lyagoba, all the 47 health centers file their returns to the District which in turn sends them to the Ministry of Health.Mr Kasadha said despite 7,000 teenage deliveries being recorded in Kamuli District last year, only 300 cases of defilement were reported to police.And while the report says that out of 2,615 mothers who took on family planning, only 675 were teenage mothers, Mr Lyagoba said a  significant number  feared to deliver from health centres because they will be charged with abetting defilement.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Primary-six-pupil-delivers-triplets-police-hunt-father/688334-5117030-jdt24y/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post26.png
23,Constitution: Government plots new changes - Daily Monitor,"Parliament- The government will table a new Bill in Parliament before the end of this month to introduce a raft of proposed Constitution amendments, the Attorney General (AG), Mr William Byaruhanga, said yesterday. The Bills have been prepared for submission to Cabinet for approval prior to being introduced in Parliament by end of May for debate and enactment,  he said in response to accusations that the government was dragging its feet on the matter.Members of Parliament, particularly those in the Opposition, had raised concern that government s inordinate delay to present constitutional reforms as ordered by the Supreme Court, was calculated to circumvent the Electoral Commission s (EC) plan to run a clean vote. Releasing the 2020/21 strategic plan and election roadmap in Kampala last December, EC chairman Simon Byabakama said they were willing to deliver a  fair and transparent  ballot as long as other stakeholders meet their part of the bargain. To achieve the above, the commission appeals to the government, particularly Cabinet and the Legislature, to ensure timely amendment and or enactment of the relevant electoral laws, including considerations of recommendations [by] the Supreme Court,  he noted.Supreme Court judges, in their verdict on the Amama Mbabazi petition challenging President Museveni s re-election in 2016, raised 10 issues for the Executive and Parliament to fix through legislation.The Supreme Court ordered the AG, as the government s chief legal adviser, to follow up on the implementation of the recommendations but he is yet to report back to court, even after the two-year threshold period the court gave him to update it, lapsed.Mr Byaruhanga yesterday told MPs that they had delayed to table the Bills due to the protracted legal battle, both at the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court, over Parliament s amendments to the Constitution to, among other things, scrap the presidential age limit. He did not divulge details of the proposed constitutional changes. Also to be amended are the Electoral Commission Act; the Presidential Elections Act; the Parliamentary Elections Act and the Local Government Elections Act. The shadow Attorney General, Mr Wilfred Niwagaba, said the government was running Parliament in circles, and there was no sign that they are ready. He said the new constitution al amendments must be broader than those ordered by the Supreme Court to include proposals by the Opposition.Mr Niwagaba has already presented to Parliament, a draft motion, seeking leave of the House to table what he calls comprehensive reforms.The Deputy Speaker, Mr Jacob Oulanyah, who presided over the House proceedings, advised him to delay tabling of the Private Member s Bill to the government s self-set deadline at the end of this month.These included revising the timeframe for filing and determining a presidential election petition, associated nature of evidence to be adduced, the duration within which to hold election in the event of an annulment and regulation on technology use in voting. Other matters the justices asked the two arms of government to prescribe in law included access and use of the public broadcaster (Uganda Broadcasting Corporation), right timing for enacting required legislation, donations during campaigns, role of public officers in vote canvassing and that of the Attorney General in election petitions.

24,Apaa land row: Why Museveni chose Oulanyah over Rugunda - Daily Monitor,"AMURU/ADJUMANI- President Museveni at the weekend appointed Deputy Speaker of Parliament Jacob Oulanyah chair of a new committee formed to seek an everlasting solution to the Apaa land wrangles in Amuru and Adjumani districts. Mr Oulanyah, who is also the Omoro County MP, replaces the Prime Minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda, who the President appointed in August last year to head an eight-member committee from both Adjumani and Amuru to discuss his recommendations on ending the land impasse. Dr Rugunda will now serve as Mr Oulanyah s deputy on the new committee.The new committee comprises first Deputy Prime Minister Moses Ali, minister for Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees Hillary Onek, Lands minister Betty Amongi and Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, the Tourism minister.Mr Oulanyah on Monday announced the new development on his Facebook page. When H.E Yoweri Kaguta Museveni came to Omoro on Saturday, I requested to have discussion with him and he granted me audience, After our meeting yesterday [Sunday], we had another meeting today with the Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda. We had very fruitful deliberations and the President announced a new committee on Apaa, which will be chaired by me and deputised by PM [Prime Minister],  he stated.Oulanyah s appealHe noted that the committee will revisit and seek all the possible lasting solutions to ensure that the people of Apaa have peace. I call upon factions from both the Acholi and Madi that are fuelling conflict and disseminating wrong information to cease and work together towards ensuring that unity is forged so that our people live together,  Mr Oulanyah said.His appointment comes five days after government pronounced its stand on the disputed Apaa land where it ordered the occupants to vacate.Mr Museveni has now made a U-turn and appointed Mr Oulanyah.Sources, who preferred anonymity in order to speak freely, told Daily Monitor that Mr Oulanyah at the weekend pleaded with the President to allow him a chance to lead the negotiations given his vast knowledge of the contested land.The sources said the Deputy Speaker briefed the President that the genesis of the land was not the purported conflict between the two communities but was orchestrated by the 2002 motion moved in Parliament to degazette the land into a game reserve. He also stated that the problem was worsened when the statutory instrument of Parliament came out in 2012, a decade later, when people were already settled on the said land.Mr Museveni was reportedly convinced by Mr Oulanyah s disclosure that unknown people, suspected to be from the Madi Community, erected a store in Zoka Centre where food stuffs were being stored.Sources within the NRM party also intimidated to this newspaper that the President was prompted to pick on Mr Oulanyah following a briefing that a section of supporters from Acholi had threatened to boycott his planned visit to the sub-region.Following failed negotiations involving political, religious and cultural leaders to bring an end to the conflict over the disputed Apaa land, a new face was brought in to bring an everlasting solution. Dr Rugunda s appointment had brought confidence between the two parties, whose common goal was to have the longstanding impasse resolved given his success in previous negotiations between government and the Lord s Resistance Army rebel leaders Joseph Kony.However, five months down the road, the negotiation meetings hit a snag after both parties failed to reach a harmonised position on the recommendations by Mr Museveni.This would later be followed by Cabinet decisions ordering more than 26,000 residents settled on the Apaa land to vacate the land, citing that its gazetted East Madi Wildlife Reserve located in Adjumani district.The Prime Minister s communication specialist, Mr Julius Mucunguzi, could neither confirm or deny that the premier was replaced.  I cannot comment on that matter,  Mr Mucunguzi said yesterday.MIXED REACTIONS OVER DEPUTY SPEAKER S APPOINTMENTDr Daniel Komakech, the chairperson of the Acholi delegation, said is optimistic that the new team will deliver on their expectations. Last month, Dr Komakech accused Dr Rugunda of failing the talks.  During the talks, we made our submissions open to be debated and discussed but the premier could not compel the Madi team to do the same as agreed. To date, we don t know what their proposals contain. Besides, he was too authoritative and kept making executive orders,  he said. The prime minister of Acholi Cultural Institution, Mr Ambrose Ola, said Mr Museveni s decision to halt the evictions is vital. The earlier decision was going to worsen the situation. Let us hope that this committee listens to the people and comes up with better solutions to the people in the area that will see them live in peace,  he said.Mr Michael Lakony, the Amuru District chairperson, said Mr Oulanyah s appointment was a  tactical way of worsening the Apaa land conflict. Oulanyah comes from Acholi and in case he makes decisions that don t favour the Acholi, he will be tagged as a traitor. The Madi people will on the other side blame him for taking sides if he comes out with positions that don t favour them,  he said.The Adjumani District chairperson, Mr James Leku, said:  For us the Madi team, we are ready to work with any government officials to see that the matter is settled peacefully,   he said.

25,Tears as mourners eulogise Sebei bishop - Daily Monitor,"Kampala-  Mourners yesterday paid tribute to Bishop Augustine Arap Yona Salimo during a funeral service at All Saints Cathedral, Nakasero in Kampala. It was a sombre mood as various people eulogised the former bishop of Sebei Diocese describing him as a mentor, teacher, father, passionate and humble servant who worked for peace and development of the country.Bishop Salimo, 70, the first bishop of Sebei Diocese, succumbed to intestinal obstruction and cardiac arrest on May 11 after spending three weeks in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Mengo Hospital where he was referred from Mbale.Mr Titus Sokuton, a son of the deceased, said his father developed illness on Easter Sunday evening after hosting more than 500 people at his home and preaching at two churches. At the end of the celebration, my father complained of severe abdominal pain. He vomited for a few minutes and he was rushed to the hospital where he was diagnosed with intestinal obstruction and doctors advised an emergency operation but he collapsed due to cardiac arrest.  The doctors referred him to Mbale hospital but on reaching there, they did not have an ICU and we drove to Mengo where he was worked upon but his condition deteriorated,  Mr Sokuton said.He said the bishop died 10 days after his 70th birthday and a day after he was discharged from ICU. He was our hero, a great spiritual leader, mentor and peacemaker. He loved everyone but God loved him most, that is why he is gone,  said Mr Sokuton, a nursing officer working with the Uganda People s Defence Forces.The Archbishop of the Church of Uganda, Stanley Ntagali, said it was worth celebrating the life of Bishop Salimo because of his work. He was a dear friend and humble man, a prayerful man of God, an exemplary leader because of his love. I know he mentored so many people, including the current bishop. We need so many people who are kind and generous,  said Archbishop Ntagali, who asked the congregation to emulate the late bishop on love and peace making.Archbishop Ntagali said the deceased was a gift from God who treated fellow clergy as brothers. He was a counsellor, teacher and worked tirelessly for the good of everything. Life is a struggle but there are no strong waves that can stop your purpose. Let people know you and me by our fruits just like our brother (Salimo) exhibited love, reconciliation and he was a great pillar,  he added. Whatever he planned, he made sure to succeed. He bought 369 acres of land for the Diocese of Sebei, increased the number of churches and the trained clergy,  said Ms Zelda Salimo, the widow. She appealed to the Sapiiy community to emulate unity and reconciliation.The director of CMS-Africa, the Rev Can Moses Bushendich, commended the deceased for mentoring the clergy among them his successor, building a vibrant children ministry as well as promoting accountability and transparency. Bishop Salimo preached and modelled mindset renewal, love and humility. He occasionally brought us a flask of tea in office from his home. His hospitality for visitors and the ministry teammates is unmatched.  He was a strong member of the East African Revival movement and participated in many revival conferences,  said the Rev Can Bushendich, revealing that the deceased recruited and grew him in the church ministry.Ill-equipped hospitalsMs Zelda Salimo, the widow, said her husband s fate gave her an opportunity to know how ill-equipped the hospitals are. I appeal to the country to ensure that all health facilities are equipped. I saw doctors working in a very difficult situation. But here is a bishop, how about a poor person   she wondered, suggesting that every district needs to have a referral hospital.Ms Salimo, who pledged to work towards uplifting Kapchorwa Hospital, revealed that her husband is the fifth cleric to die in Kapchorwa in a year.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/mourners-eulogise-Sebei-bishop-Stanley-Ntagali-Church/688334-5115378-lhwcno/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post29.png
26,Fate of street children is not our job   Janet - Daily Monitor,"Kampala- The Ministry of Education and Sports has said the mandate of removing children from streets lies with the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development before they are received in schools.Ms Janet Museveni, the minister of Education, made the remarks on Monday during the National Resistance Movement (NRM) manifesto week where she shared her ministry s achievements in the education sector and the setbacks. In a question-and-answer session with journalists, she said there was not any interventions outlined for children on the streets because it is outside her ministry s mandate.  That one is not with us. Most of you know that street children lie with the Ministry of Gender. It is not under our mandate to deal with street children, unfortunately. That is why I didn t say anything about it,  Ms Museveni, who also is the First Lady, said.InterventionsLast week, Bbosa Kizito, the manager for Loans and Scholarships at the Higher Education Students  Financing Board, told employers that there is need for their intervention in recovery of loans from the beneficiaries.The board is targeting employers to help government recover the loans from the students who benefited. He said from their data, 38.6 per cent of students who received government loans are from western Uganda, followed by 26.1 per cent from eastern while central took third position with 24.8 per. The northern region students accounted for 10.5 per cent of the loan beneficiaries. The government loans are meant for science students.  We want all children in all corners of the country to get higher education, skills and make a contribution to the economy. We are doing badly on gender ratios. There are fewer girls doing sciences. Parents encourage your daughters to enrol for sciences so that we lend them the money,  Mr Kizito appealed.He added:  Regionally, we are not doing well. Do something to the north. Tell them to go to school because we consider those who have applied. In central, most boys have gone to ride boda-bodas and most girls got married. The western people are sending children to school and enjoying. The community should get concerned and ask those children in the market why they are there when they are of school-going age. In our time, everyone was your parent. Today, they look on. Recently, we were in Karamoja, I saw the Karimojong old and young on the streets begging. It is a whole generation wasted. Why are those children on the streets  Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) should do something. However, Ms Harriet Mudondo, the KCCA director in-charge of Gender, Community Services and Production, yesterday said their challenge is that every time they remove the street children, there are new recruits that are brought back.  We rescue children from the streets regularly. On average, 100 children are rescued at every operation. The challenge is that they keep coming back from Karamoja, Mbale and Jinja. When you remove them today, the next morning you find new ones,  Ms Mulondo said.The ministry of Education permanent secretary, Mr Alex Kakooza, said the public schools are ready to receive them once the children have been removed from the streets. The mandate of making sure children get off the streets is the mandate of ministry of Gender. Our job is to make sure the schools are ready to receive them. When they are still on the streets, they fall outside our responsibility. Our schools are waiting for them when Gender [ministry] has taken them off the street,  Mr Kakooza said during the NRM manifesto week.

29,Sudan army ruler suspends civil rule talks - Daily Monitor,"Sudan's military rulers on Thursday suspended crucial talks with protesters on installing civilian rule, insisting more time was needed to finalise the deal as Khartoum's security situation deteriorated.On Wednesday army generals and protest leaders were expected to decide on the make-up of a new body to govern Sudan for three years, the thorniest issue in instating civilian rule following the ouster of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir last month.But after at least eight people were reported wounded by gunshots near a sit-in outside the army complex in the capital, Sudan's army ruler General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced negotiations would be suspended for 72 hours.Burhan -- the chief of the ruling military council that took power after Bashir was toppled -- left the door open to resume talks but demanded protesters dismantle roadblocks in Khartoum, open bridges and railway lines connecting the capital and ""stop provoking security forces"".There were ""armed elements among demonstrators who were shooting at security forces"", he added.Earlier on Wednesday, protest leaders told AFP of the ruling military council's decision to suspend talks.""They asked us to dismantle barricades in parts of the capital,"" Rashid al-Sayid, a spokesman of the umbrella protest movement the Alliance for Freedom and Change said.'Many assaults on us'Roadblocks on key thoroughfares are being used by demonstrators to pressure the generals to transfer power to a civilian administration.The protest group that spearheaded the campaign against Bashir said the generals wanted the demonstrators to restrict themselves to the sit-in area where thousands have camped for weeks in central Khartoum, demanding civilian rule. Some roadblocks were later removed after the protest group urged demonstrators to abide by the request, an AFP correspondent reported.Protester Mohamed expressed disappointment over the suspended negotiations, telling AFP they had ""delayed so many times and there have been so many assaults on us"".The protest movement is demanding a civilian-led transition, which the generals have steadfastly resisted since bowing to their demands and toppling longtime autocrat Bashir.During the first two days of talks the two sides had agreed on an overall civilian structure, including a three-year transitional period for the full transfer of power to a civilian administration.They had also agreed that parliament be composed of 300 members for the transition, with 67 percent from the alliance and the rest drawn from other political groups.The composition of the new sovereign council has been the toughest part of the negotiations, with the two sides so far proposing different compositions of the body which is expected to take all key decisions concerning national issues.The generals want it to be military-led, while the protesters insist on a majority civilian body.'Provoking security forces'  Earlier General Yasser al-Atta, one of the members of the current ruling military council, had vowed to reach a deal by early Thursday that ""meets the people's aspirations"".But in his statement announcing the suspension, chief Burhan said the protesters were ""provoking the security forces"", referring to reports of clashes between demonstrators and members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).The RSF had ""taken the side of the people's revolution and played an important role in its victory"".Hours before the talks were due to start on Wednesday, the Alliance for Freedom and Change wrote on Facebook that eight people had been wounded by live fire.A witness told AFP that gunshots had been fired near the sit-in.The British ambassador to Khartoum said Sudanese security forces had fired at protesters.""Extremely concerned by use of live ammunition by Sudanese security forces against protesters in Khartoum today, with reports of civilian casualties,"" Irfan Siddiq wrote on Twitter.""Military council must act to stop this now. No more excuses.""Security forces were seen chasing protesters in downtown Khartoum and removing some roadblocks, an AFP correspondent said.Tension had flared since Monday when five protesters and an army officer were killed in shootings near the sit-in.The new council is expected to form a transitional civilian government, which would then prepare for the first post-Bashir election after the three-year changeover period ends.Protest leader Khalid Omar Yousef downplayed the role of the proposed ruling council, insisting Sudan would have a powerful cabinet.""All powers will be in the cabinet's hand, which will be formed by the Alliance for Freedom and Change,"" he said.Only the defence and interior ministries would be headed by military figures, he said.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Sudan-army-ruler-suspends-civil-rule-talks/688340-5117304-2bequ3/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post33.png
30,New DR Congo president in diplomatic flurry - Daily Monitor,"The Democratic Republic of Congo's new President Felix Tshisekedi has launched a flurry of diplomatic moves, with France on Wednesday announcing a visit next week of Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.The announcement came a day after Tshisekedi said Kinshasa was resuming military cooperation with former colonial power Belgium, and after the sprawling central African country sought rapprochement with neighbouring Rwanda.Tshisekedi met Tuesday with two senior officials in the Belgian foreign ministry, following a meeting Friday with Rwanda's army chief of staff.Elected in December, Tshisekedi met Renier Nijskens, Belgium's special envoy for the Great Lakes region, and Philippe Boucke, the country's deputy chief of staff.The Belgian government said the two countries might exchange ambassadors ""soon"".Relations between the DRC and Belgium soured considerably in the last two years of the rule of Tshisekedi's predecessor Joseph Kabila.Kinshasa objected to Brussels' criticism over its crackdown on demonstrations demanding that Kabila step aside at the end of his second constitutional mandate in December 2016.Kinshasa suspended its military cooperation with Brussels in April 2017, prompting Brussels to recall its ambassador.On Friday, Tshisekedi met with Rwandan army chief of staff Patrick Nyamvumba. The new Congolese leader had travelled in late March to Kigali to pay his respects at a memorial to victims of the 1994 Rwandan genocide ahead of the 25th anniversary of the slaughter -- a first for a Congolese president.The presence of dozens of armed groups in eastern DRC, near the border with Rwanda, has been a source of bilateral tensions.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/New-DR-Congo-president-diplomatic-flurry/688340-5117322-x1cqrf/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post35.png
31,US Catholic dioceses announce abuse 'compensation program' - Daily Monitor,"Six Catholic dioceses in the United States rolled out a ""compensation program"" Tuesday as an alternative to court proceedings for minors sexually abused by clergy.The program by the dioceses, all of which are located in California, will be managed by two independent monitors who have handled similar programs in New York and Pennsylvania, the Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles Jose Gomez said in a letter to worshipers.""We are joining with five other dioceses in California in a new initiative to provide pastoral care and financial support to any person who has been sexually abused as a minor by a diocesan priest,"" Gomez wrote.""We also understand that some victim-survivors are reluctant to come to the church for assistance. Our hope with this new program is to give these people a chance to seek redress and healing through an independent program.""According to California church officials, the program will be open to anybody who was abused by a priest as a minor, including people residing in the US illegally and those for whom the statute of limitations to prosecute their abuser has expired.No lawyer will be necessary, and the process will be free and conducted in a ""non-adversarial"" manner that respects victims' privacy, according to the letter.The six dioceses involved in the program represent some 10 million Catholics in California, many of whom have origins in Latin America where the church is particularly strong.The Catholic Church both in the US and across the globe is struggling to deal with an epidemic of sexual assault by priests, much of it directed at minors.The abuse has often gone on for decades and been covered up by church hierarchy.The program's announcement came the same day that five Catholic molestation victims filed a lawsuit in a Minnesota federal court asking a judge to compel the Vatican to open its archives and release details of abusive priests.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/US-Catholic-dioceses-announce-abuse-compensation-program/688340-5117328-xf845rz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post36.png

33,Ocaya to bring his car dream to life - Daily Monitor,"Born to Silverno Orinyo from Zombo, Matthias Ocaya, 25, is one of the innovators in the vocational field, thanks to his persistence. An old student of Otoroga Boys Primary School in Zombo, Ocaya started dreaming about joining vocational education then, but his father would not hear any of it.  After Primary Seven, I told my father that I wanted to enroll in a vocational institute although he wanted me to continue to secondary school. So, I joined St Aloysius Secondary School in Zombo District and while there, my knowledge on innovation developed,  Ocaya recalls. He got career guidance and learned that he could actually go enroll in a vocational school after O-Level.  Whenever we got holidays, I would go to different people in my village for apprenticeship in plumbing work, building and wiring. I did that from Senior One holidays to Senior Four. In Senior Four vacation, I built myself a house and since I wanted to make a door for it, I went to a certain carpenter in my village to ask him for his equipment,  he says. But the carpenter instead asked him to come and help him at his workshop since he had no one to work with. Ocaya started work the following day.  I made my door but also learnt more skills, so, next, I made myself a bed but before I could take it home, a buyer asked for it. I told him I could make him one and he paid me Shs200,000. This was the first money I earned and through him, I got many more customers,  he narrates. Although Ocaya did carpentry work, being a mechanic was his ultimate dream. After Senior Four vacation, he still expressed interest in vocational education but his father still did not want him to go.  I joined A-Level at Paidha Senior Secondary School but class things had gotten a bit slow for me. I looked for a garage in the area where I would work at the weekend and during the holiday. It was then that I thought about making a prototype of a car from timber,  he says. Realising his dreamWith six points after A-Level, he joined vocational school. Ocaya joined Lugogo Vocational Institute in Kampala in 2016.  Two weeks into the course, I went to my lecturer and told him I wanted to build a car. He asked me how I was going to do it and told me to write a proposal with all the details and to also draw what I wanted to make. He also asked me whether I would be able to pull it off,  Ocaya explains. In first year, when real life projects were introduced and they were asked to make stoves, Ocaya had bigger fish to fry in mind.  In second year when they told us to build something, I just wanted to build a car. I already had my proposal and I told the teacher that I wanted to make a car, but he said that could not work. I went and talked to the head of department, who gave me a go ahead,  he recalls.Financial constraitsOcaya had no money. So during holidays, he went to the village and found work.  I earned Shs150,000 which I used to buy some things such as a motor, magnetar and other things for my prototype.  Ocaya spent two and a half months building the car in addition to building and designing things such as DC stoves, water pumps and a car heater for friends in order to get money for his prototype. After completing his prototype, he took it to the teacher and showed off his dream. The prototype was a solar driven car with an external steering wheel which he could use to control its movements.  But because I had a tuition debt, I went back to the village to look for money. From there, I was called by the principal for a vocational exhibition at Parliament in November 2017. I was also allowed to do my examinations. But when I went back to the village with my Shs400,000 that I had got from people who saw my innovation at the exhibition, I decided to build a big car which I am currently working on but won t give a lot of details about it for now,  Ocaya asserts.  I was also recently invited to an exhibition at UBTEB, where I exhibited my car before the Education minister Janet Museveni. But as I work on my big project, I also work in a garage in my village because I still have a debt at school,  he says. Ocaya needs about Shs95m to build his first big prototype of a solar driven car. Other student innovationsTogether with his robotics team, the International University of East Africa students built a car surveillance system. Andrew Bakashaba said, this is a smart home surveillance system that will have multiple functions. It will be able to; pick up sound, take videos, see what is at a distance, will be able to detect obstacles and able to control the lighting system in a home using a timer. It will also be able to pick feedback, move for example in a compound or house and do all those functions. I specifically did the parking coding that detects obstacles. We have built a control module/app that is connected to a mobile app, so it can connect everywhere, plus the camera module. We are still working on that body to adopt to functions and implement some parts but we want to have a working prototype soon. The surveillance car works as a proof of concept that we can build our own robots without studying a specific course.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Ocaya-car-dream-to-life-carpentry-work-Zombo-District/688336-5112776-rvg9my/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post38.png
34,Want to boost your career  Read - Daily Monitor,"Gives me confidenceMy job is to sell knowledge, history and tell a story the clients have no idea about. This has taught me to read constantly. Everyday I read something in relation to travel. Before taking any person to the site, I visit it first, make research and buy any written literature about it. I read any travel literature I come across naturally. I even read about the different Christian historical sites. I may not necessarily buy a book, but I carry out research and read online. This has opened my mind and widened my knowledge about different cultures. When I am talking to people; I speak with confidence because I am sure about what I am telling them. Mary Josephina Nanyonga, tours and travel dealerMotivated my career choiceMy reading journey started while in primary school. I enjoyed reading fictional stories such as Mr Hare tales because I found them entertaining. While in secondary school I would visit the school library to read novels during my free time. I read a book titled To Be the Best by Barbara Taylor which motivated me to aim higher and opened me up to more of her work such as A woman of Substance, which inspired me to pursue a career in finance. Currently, I read mathematics-related articles and mainly motivational books. My current read is Nice Girls Don t Get the Corner Office which talks about unconscious mistakes women make that sabotage their careers.Ann Kyakuwaire, auditorReading makes me practicalKyamanywa handles civil law cases to do with property, family issues that entail divorce, annulment, child custody. Because of his choice of work, he says his reading is not about to end. To manage handling the different cases I realised I need to have an inquisitive mind, excellent analytical skills and the ability to think.  At times clients expect an immediate answer. With this I came to a conclusion that lawyers need to be good readers. I read books such as Civil rights and Liberties in the 21 century, In Our Defense. The Civil Rights book gives an analysis of the Supreme Court s landmark rulings on civil rights and liberties. Reading has made me resourceful to my clients, taught me new court presentations and has helped me improve on my vocabulary. However, it calls for commitment. Currently, I am reading My Life in Court by Louise Nizer. Edward Cooper Kyamanywa, lawyerBroadened my thinkingMy reading culture started at the age of 10. In those early years I read a lot of adventure books. I would literally feel as if I was on the same adventure journey as the characters in the book. As a teen, I began reading literature from authors such as Jeffrey Archer, Wilbur Smith and Danielle Steele, which helped me understand new concepts about life and my vocabulary. While in high school he was introduced to African authors such as Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and others whose works gave him a new understanding of the continent. Today, I read different genres of literature, popular psychology, faith-based books, biographies, African books on history and economics, leadership and management books, motivational books. Reading has broadened my mind. I am able to know and understand a variety of topics. Currently, I am reading Purple Cow by Seth Godin, which is about avoiding being average. If you want to develop a reading culture, start slowly with one book at a time, those that you will enjoy, as well as joining a book club.Stirling Gapara, leadership and management consultantEnlightened meAmos Wekesa s reading culture did not develop until 2001 when he committed to reading for two hours a day. Reading different literature such as Transformation of Singapore from third world to second world, Problems of Africa, he says his reading kept improving. When reading, I spare 45 minute to read about a topic I am involved in. This has given me leverage over many people who come to me for information. I was influenced into reading by my wife. My wife is a good reader and so are my children. I realised if I did not read I would remain the idiot of the family. Writing has also given me an opportunity to read. The more you write, the more you read.Amos Wekesa, tourism entrepreneurKeeps my brain activeMy father used to read a lot. When I was a child, he would read to me story books written in Rutooro. Slowly, I began to broaden my reading scope. When I joined Nyakasura School, I started a newspaper called The Student. But today, I read medicine-related material, I read about the latest advances, news about medicine and I do a lot of research.  I keep tickling my brain by reading all the necessary literature within my profession and others I find relevant. Vincent Karuhanga, doctorLeaders are readers Leaders are readers. If you want to be a leader then you must be a reader. If you want to excel in any field such as being a politician or fashion designer you have to be a long-life learner and reader.  In life there has to be continuous improvement in all that we do. And the way you can improve is to continuously read.   If the last time you read a book was the time you graduated from university, yet you have been working for the last five years, it means you are stunted. As an educationist, I read constantly. I believe, the more you read, the better you become. Through reading I have been mentored by different people I admire but can never have conversations with. My recent great read has been by Michelle Obama s, Becoming. But currently I am reading The 15 Rules of Growth by John Maxwell. He says growth is intentional, not accidental. To inspire my children to read, each time any of them reads a book I put Shs10,000 in their piggy bank.

36,Essay challenge brings students  knowledge on biotechnology to life - Daily Monitor,"In a bid to familiarise students with modern biotechnology, National Crop Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) organised the Biotechnology Essay Writing Contest among secondary and university students.Resty Nansubuga, the 17-year-old science student at St Joseph s Girls Senior Secondary School, who scooped the best essay award in the secondary school category, says she only learnt about plant breeding using modern biotechnology in a bid to develop Genetically Modified Organisms crops from her teacher recently.Her essay focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food under the theme;  Modern Biosciences for more nutritious food . She explained the use of breeding crops using advanced technology to develop improved varieties which have better nutrition and are high yielding hence capable of feeding the world s growing population.Organised by the Uganda Biosciences Information centre, the competition attracted several students who, like Nansubuga, had scanty knowledge about crop breeding. Widespread issueBut this lack of knowledge is also true in majority of Ugandans who are ignorant about plant breeding using modern biotechnology and mistake improved plant varieties such as hybrids with GMOs.Thus scientists at NaCRRI have put in efforts to sensitise school children right from primary to university level by organising essay competitions where the students are required to search for information about application of modern biotechnology in plant breeding. The 6th edition of the essay competition awardees were given certificates, plaques, laptops and a one-week internship training at NaCRRI.This was the first time most of the competing students were visiting the research institute and its laboratory where tissue culture cassava breeding is being done by breeding them in tests tubes. The students were also amazed to see tissue culture cassava growing from test tubes to a full plant in the field.Enlightened Nasubuga was excited to receive her award and promised to sensitise fellow students at her school and other communities on the importance of scientists using emerging technologies to breed crops. I do not see any difference between improved cassava, maize and rice varieties with the traditional varieties being tested at the institute. I have heard that many Ugandans are opposed to improved crop varieties but it seems people lack knowledge about what the scientists are doing,  she asserted. Students submitted essays under the topic modern Biosciences to produce better nutritious food while Nsubuga focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food citing orange sweet potato and cassava which is bred conventionally and pro vitamin A treangenic banana which contains Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.She is optimistic that she will encourage fellow students to read scientific books to get knowledge especially in Biosciences be it in crop breeding of applied science to developing vaccines and drugs in the health sector.For Marvin Steven Nsubuga, the overall winner in the tertiary and university category, this is his third time participating in the awards. He submitted his first essay in 2015 when he was a Senior Five student and won an accolade, a certificate and a one-week internship at the institute.Nsubuga, a first year Administrative Science student at Kyambogo University, researched on using applied modern biotechnology to breed crops which can be used as a raw material in order to boost the industrial sector. He focused on crops such cassava which farmers will be able to grow and get high yields which can be supplied to brewing industries.  The starch can also be used to process glue and highly processed cassava flour used by industries processing confectionary products. I am currently disseminating this information for government to make good policy,  he noted.On his third time competing, Nsubuga scooped a certificate, plaque, a laptop and a one week internship at the institute. More student researchHe is encouraging university students to be in search of scientific information, especially in agricultural science where scientists are breeding crops to address challenges of climate change and devising ways of feeding the growing population in the world.National Agricultural Research Organisation board chairman, Prof Joseph Obua, urged students to pursue science subjects because science is a driver and engine of economic growth of all nations. I am urging teachers to use the best methods when teaching science subjects; make it simple and practical. This is because children tend to shy away from science subjects because teachers are using complex words which scare them. It is important to simplify the words for students to appreciate science, technology and innovations,  he noted.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Essay-challenge-brings-students-knowledge-biotechnology-life-/688336-5101200-d2t4y2z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post41.png
37,Startup tips crucial to vocational students - Daily Monitor,"One of the major challenges vocational graduates face is lack of start-up capital despite being trained to be job creators not seekers. This sometimes forces them to end up in the job seekers pool which their training was trying to avoid.For a long time, Sophie Joyce Laker, a Fashion and Design student at Kitgum Technical Institute, would worry about starting a business citing lack of money. What Laker did not know though, was that mindset is the first capital and for as long as one s brain is functional, they can do anything they set out to do. She also came to learn that an entrepreneur must not keep complaining about challenges such as rent and delays in supplies but rather always devise solutions. The Fashion and Design student has since started a business; Rwot-Twero Workshop in Kitgum Town. But it was not until the Skills for Life programme recently that Laker realised all this and more about mentorship in business.Thirty youthful entrepreneurs from Kitgum Technical Institute and Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute in Gulu, received training in business start-ups and expansion skills from Enterprise Uganda experts, to ensure their dreams are realised. Subsequent follow-up visits to measure their progress coupled with mentorship have been ongoing since. Funded by Uganda Breweries (UBL), this expert training and mentoring under the Skills for Life programme aims at avoiding this. Launched in 2001, the programme has so far seen more than 114 scholarships awarded to academically deserving yet economically disadvantaged students with the aim of curbing youth unemployment and high school dropouts.The problemUganda s small and medium scale businesses are estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000; employing 2.5 million people (about 90 per cent of private sector jobs) and contributing about 20 per cent to the country s Gross Domestic Product, while producing 80 per cent of manufactured output. In fact, studies have ranked Uganda as one of the most entrepreneurial nations in the world. However, the business failure rate is equally high   standing at more than 50 per cent. This is due to various challenges, including lack of financial support and vital skills including entrepreneurial, management, marketing and financial planning. Other challenges include lack of business records, low corporate governance, poor banking and borrowing history, a culture that disrespects business contracts, fierce local and international competition and limited access to business development services.In fact Anjijuka Narasi Kambaho, the senior information and communication officer at Uganda Business and Technical Examinations Board, says starting personal businesses is not always easy for vocational trained graduates. There are expenses involved including purchasing the necessary equipment, paying rent and the required licenses needed for operation. Sometimes people want to first get formal jobs in order save and accumulate money for starting their own businesses later,  he says.Registered successAt Enterprise Uganda, a public-private institution aimed at promoting SMEs as the main vehicle for expanding production, providing sustainable jobs and enhancing economic growth, the Acholi youth are likely to avoid falling on the wayside like many similar businesses countrywide.  The mindset and entrepreneurship training model is an effective standard in transforming the behaviour of participants and triggering the desired action to start a business. This is corroborated by the statistic where 26 out of the 30 students actually started business after the December 2018 training, representing a 87 per cent success rate,  says Rosemary Mutyabule, the lead trainer. One such students is Nelson Mandela, of Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute who believes his poultry business can help him contribute to his family and community. Located in Custom-Corner Village, Layibi Division in Gulu municipality, Mandela s farm has 235 22-days old broiler chicks, fully vaccinated in line with the requirements from the trainers. During a visit to assess his business last month, it was discovered that Mandela, who mainly sells to roadside chicken roasters in Gulu Town feels his enterprise is delivering tangible benefits. He has earned Shs1.9m in chicken sales from his first stock giving him a profit of Shs300,000.  This poultry business is giving me a sense of purpose in life. I even sell the chicken droppings and earn at least Shs5,000 every 100kg sack,  Mandela says. Paul Otim, a Gulu-based business counsellor and mentor, who assessed Mandela s farm, believes, that though new, the enterprise has great potential to grow given the market opportunities available and the determination of the young entrepreneur.  A planned farm exposure visit will undoubtedly reinforce his potential to develop the business, especially on technical methods of handling the poultry, cost saving using local resources plus proper records management,  says Otim. Follow-upBroadly, the Skills for Life programme does not stop at the training or skilling phase, but the beneficiaries undergo various follow-up visits by the implementers who ensure the trainees  learning and development is in fulfillment of the programme s objectives.The latest additions to this initiative are 20 students of Kabale s African College of Commerce and Technology and another 20 from Datamine Institute in Kampala for whom UBL has provided up to about Shs115m to cover tuition for their second year of study, entrepreneurship training as well as seed capital for those that would have excelled in the programme.And for Sunday Auma Okee, an Electrical Systems and Maintenance student at Kitgum Technical Institute, the scholarship, aside from helping him stay in school, has helped him learn to start a business with what he has and in fact his dream of opening an electrical workshop seems closer. Interventions Edward Asiimwe, the principal at Uganda Rural Development and Training institute, says policy makers, the government in particular needs to support vocational training at all levels.  Just like in other education sectors, increased funding and investment is also mandatory in vocational institutions.  In addition, Asiimwe believes that students need to be continuously given the proper career guidance to enable them make better informed academic choices.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Startup-tips-crucial-vocational-students/688336-5101216-aaicob/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post42.png
38,"Influx of private schools, what s the catch  - Daily Monitor","Joseph Byaruhanga, earns Shs300,000 per month as a security guard. He has a family of three children to cater for, as well as paying other bills. His first two children attend a nearby private primary school in Namasuba, Zanna where he pays fees of Shs170,000 for each child totaling to Shs340,000 a term. Apart from tuition, he has to buy scholastic materials and other fees as directed by the school. Byaruhanga is not your rich parent but he sure is among the growing list of parents who year by year join the private schools trend as the best way to educate their children.  The problem with universal primary education schools is that the population in class is too high. It is possible to find more than 200 pupils in one class. Private schools have a small teacher to pupil ratio. You will find 50 pupils in a class which is manageable. A child in a class of many pupils will not learn anything and might take long to understand,  Byaruhanga says. In 1997, government introduced Universal Primary Education. Under this arrangement, four children in every family were to study free of charge in all government-aided primary schools. Almost 10 years after UPE, the government introduced Universal Secondary Education becoming the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education. But despite this, parents are increasingly parting with huge sums of money to educate their children in private schools. As such numbers of private schools increase each year.According to the Uganda Schools Guide website, as of today there are more than 13,000 private schools in 127 districts in Uganda. Among the private schools are the high end ones that offer foreign curriculums and target wealthy parents and the ones that target middle income earners. The endless challenges plaguing most public schools have increasingly eroded public confidence. They have been labelled as for the  poor  forcing some parents to take children to private schools where they hope to find better education for their children.The increase in enrollment of students has not only accelerated a rise in private schools across the country; but also the cost of education. Overwhelming numbersIn January 2018, Alex Kakooza, the permanent secretary of Ministry of Education and Sports while at the Senior One selection exercise at Uganda Manufacturers Association grounds announced that government had scrapped Universal Secondary Education in private schools under the Public Private Partnership (PPP). At the peak was a challenge of funding and an increasing number of ghost students. This did not go down well with parents who had fear of transferring their children to public schools for the USE programme dreading the appalling conditions of overcrowding. For instance, at Masindi Secondary School, a government funded school, students study in shifts; some in the morning to noon while others from 2pm to evening. According to Byaruhanga,  Some parents take their children to UPE schools because the tuition is relatively lower there. Personally I do not have much money but I want my children to at least have a good education. I would rather pay in installments to make sure that my children study in a private school. But the move to scrap USE from private schools was intended to raise money and ensure that every sub county has a public school. According to Kakooza, more than 615 government sub-counties had no secondary schools. At the time, government would pay Shs47,000 for each student per term in a private school under the USE programme. Mpumudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District is one of the new schools established by government to create equity in providing education across the country. However, since its establishment, the school is still housed in Mpumudde Primary School buildings with a few new classroom blocks. Sanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher, recently expressed worry over a surging student population with no facilities while at the launch of a digital library at the school.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space where to put this digital library. My teachers have nowhere to sit because the staffroom is now full of digital tablets,  he said.  We want extra building materials and land for expansion and creation of access roads and a laboratory with chemicals and equipment,  he added.Aggrey Kibenge, the undersecretary at the Ministry of Education and Sports who was the chief guest at the event gave a one worded response.  We shall look into the matter at the ministry.  High price to pay With appalling conditions in both public primary and secondary schools, private schools have been increasing over time to attend to the needs of frustrated parents but at a much higher cost.According to the ministry of Education, the Private Schools and Institutions department was inaugurated in 2008, consequent to the restructuring of the ministry to cater for the ever expanding private investment in education. Since the government decision to liberalise the education sector in 1993, thousands of schools and institutions have been set up by private investors. In the secondary sub-sector, the number of private schools, at about 4,000, is more than double the number of government-funded schools. Light Academy on Entebbe road is one such private school that specifically cater for the middle class who can afford the fees. Mahad Budda, a student at Light Academy (former Turkish), says the school charges between Shs1.8m and Shs2m per term and the fees increase termly. However, he says, the services are worth the money because the teacher-student ratio is low with each class stream having between 28 and 32 students. He adds that the sickbay is good with fulltime nurses as well as better accommodation.Other private schools around Kampala and Wakiso districts charge between Shs500,000 and Shs2m as tuition fees for either day or boarding section. Scraped fundingAt the start of 2018, the ministry of Education scrapped funding to 792 private secondary schools which had been implementing the Universal Secondary Education programme. The ministry officials argued that the government has built capacity over the years in areas where they did not have any government-aided schools and are now ready to absorb those students in these institutions, adding that this, however, will be done in phases. The move left an estimated number of students who were expected to benefit from the Public Private Partnership in Senior One stranded.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/private-schools-children-UPE-a-laboratory-parents/688336-5112742-11d5ivi/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-16/post43.png
39,The right time to get a master s degree - Daily Monitor,"There is an increase in the number of universities in the country, making it easy for one to acquire qualifications. And as such many young people are going for graduate studies soon after their undergraduate qualifications, and as with many issues, this, too, has its advantages and disadvantages. Before Rosta Asiimwe completed her undergraduate degree in Human Nutrition, she had applied for a Masters in Public Health Nutrition.  I worked on-and-off for five months with research organisations. That little experience motivated me to take my master s degree seriously. Previously, I was just going through the motions but then I became interested in research. Besides, the pay is good in research work. The advantage of rushing into a postgraduate programme early is that you are still young and have the time to concentrate. On the downside, you tend to continue in the same course you began at undergraduate level. Gaining work experience opens the mind to a variety of career choices. The merits of growing your career first Spending a few years in the work arena can help a person focus their career goals. Grace Kenganzi, who has a Bachelor s degree in Mass Communication, undertook a postgraduate in Media and Communications after working for more than three years in a media house.  By that time, I was sure of the experience I wanted to attain   the kind that I could not get from my workplace. I had majored in public relations in my undergraduate course and since I worked for a media organisation, I had learnt on the job. I was more deliberate as I looked for a postgraduate course; I did not want just any media course because in the future, I want to branch into communication,  said Kenganzi.Samuel Bakutana, the chief executive officer Inspired Leaders International, says by concentrating on growing a career, a person comes to terms with the real demands of the job world, instead of making up their mind based on what they are told in the lecture room.  The working experience gives you a more mature perspective. By the time I went for my Master s in Leadership, I was already aware of the glaring gaps, the available opportunities and the needs of my future work. I approached the studies with a more mature, sober and committed attitude,  he says, adding:  A working background enables you relate with the programme content at a more real, practical and personal level because you have gone through the scenarios (or have examples to draw from) being presented in the course materials as you progressively apply the new or renewed learning. The financial questionWhen you are younger, chances of getting a scholarship are higher than if you are above 35 years. However, all is not bleak.  There are specialised programmes, for example The Chevening Scholarship Programme, that only gives scholarships to people who have careers,  Kenganzi says, adding,  You can only know about them when you are working. If I studied my postgraduate much earlier, I would not have thought of studying abroad or applying for a scholarship. Generally, because a master s degree can be expensive and students may be uncertain about what they want to do with their lives, students should gain some real-world experience before beginning a master s degree programme.Fitting into the labour marketEmployers are comfortable employing someone who already has job experience because, from a purely financial perspective, training of new staff is expensive and may not pay off immediately. Kenganzi believes her work experience and her master s degree gives her an edge.  I know what I want and I will ask for it. I cannot just accept anything thrown my way.  Asiimwe is not so confident.  Getting a job will be quite tricky. In the Ugandan (labour) market, (work) experience is the password and I know those who have it have an advantage over me.
