0,Uganda Airlines to make first profit in 2029 - official - Daily Monitor,"Parliament. The newly revived national carrier is expected to register its first profit in 2029, Mr Cornwell Muleya, the Uganda Airlines chief technical officer, has said.He made the revelation while appearing before the Budget Committee of Parliament chaired by Ntenjeru North MP Amos Lugoloobi to defend the Shs575b budget proposals for the airline yesterday.Mr Muleya said the national carrier will require some time to build confidence from passengers and suppliers, even after recapitalisation. When you start initially, you have very few passengers until you entrench yourself in the market,  he said.Mr Muleya said if the funds are availed, the national carrier will be able to operate and smoothly break even in seven years, and then register a profit after 10 years after which it will be able to run stably. The plan is recapitalisation and this is why the collapse of many airlines is because of undercapitalisation because they don t factor in the period you operate without needing a lot of money,  he said. If we don t get these funds, we will not be able to do this and you will not succeed because the foundation is going to be weak,  he added.The committee tasked the officials, including the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Works and Transport, Mr Wasswa Bageya, and Mr Moses Sanon, the head of monitoring and evaluation at Budget Compliance at National Planning Authority to present a break down of the budget first.The MPs also maintained that the airline must quickly put a substantive board in place to ensure there is a proper accountability mechanism.Meanwhile, more questions linger, relating to ground handling and proposed salaries.For instance, Ms Margaret Komuhangi (Nakasongola Woman, NRM) questioned why a pilot would be paid a monthly salary of Shs48m yet profits will be expected in 10 years.The MP also raised concern over Shs37b allocated for ground handling. The money has been provided for as a payout to a private contractor who will be doing ground handling for the national carrier, in what officials said would be a one year contract awaiting final takeover. In response, PS Bageya said:  The airline handles itself; we have to procure equipment to do that work and there is a provision to terminate after we are ready.  He said Uganda Airlines will first do its own ground handling and later move to handling the entire air sector. Mr Bageya said the airline was looking at three potential service providers for the ground handling, with a view of identifying one company for the job.The companies include National Aviation Services (formerly Entebbe Handling Services), DAS Handling Limited and Fresh Handling Ltd.Lawmakers are also concerned on how Shs37 billion was reached before completing the procurement process.When approving funds for the purchase of two Bombardier planes in March, legislators directed that ground handling be done by government to ensure return on investment into the airline.

1,No money for teachers  salary raise   government - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The Ministry of Public Service yesterday said there is no money for salary enhancement for the striking teachers who began their industrial action countrywide yesterday. On February 20, teachers through their umbrella, Uganda National Teachers  Union (Unatu) wrote to ministries of Public Service, Finance and Education reminding them of a commitment they made last year to enhance their salaries in 2019/20 financial year. The teachers gave the government a 90- day ultimatum that elapsed yesterday. Protracted negotiations between the teachers and government did not yield anything to avert the strike until yesterday when they started their industrial action which forced Ministry of Public Service to call an urgent meeting with various stakeholders today to discuss the matter. Mr Adam Bukenya, the acting Public Service undersecretary said the minister was in a Cabinet meeting but an official position would be reached at today. It was not clear though whether the issues of teachers  salary enhancement were discussed during the Cabinet meeting but Mr Bukenya told the teachers that they would meet them today with officials from ministries of Finance, Education and Public Service for discussion on their grievances.  The minister is in Cabinet today (yesterday). We are waiting for a meeting with all stakeholders tomorrow morning (today),  Mr Bukenya told Daily Monitor. Asked why they waited until the teachers downed their tools ahead of the opening of the second term, Mr Bukenya responded:  There is no money. That is the truth. Following a meeting with Unatu district chairpersons early this month, Mr Filbert Baguma, their general secretary, sent a public notice informing the country that unless government gives them salary increment as earlier agreed, they would not report for the second term which begins next Monday.He told Daily Monitor yesterday that the Unatu members, about 100,000 teachers across the country had gone on strike as government. We need to correct the impression that teachers continuously demand salary increment. It is just government which has been defaulting on its words. We have been considerate. We negotiated. We agreed. We signed the agreement. Let government fulfil this agreement. They had a full year to plan. We gave them a notice three months ago. They have denied having received it when our records show they got our messages. It is up to government now to shoulder the consequences of this,  Mr Baguma said. Parliament recently increased allowances of MPs who earn more than teachers. The claim was that the cost of living has gone up.Aren t they living in Uganda with other Ugandans  ...Do they have their special markets and shops  How come that if it is for other categories, it (salary increment) is realistic but when it comes to teachers, it becomes unrealistic   he added.Mr Baguma said the negotiated pay raise they expect was supposed to streamline some of their cadres  salaries at the same level with their colleagues who benefited from the first salary enhancement.He said, for instance, primary teachers under salary scale U7 who currently earn Shs467,000 per month would get Shs600,000 under the proposed pay enhancement if government honours its pledge while senior education assistants (primary teachers with diploma) will move from Shs550,000 to Shs670,000.IncrementThose under scale U5 (deputy head-teachers in primary and Grade V teachers in both secondary and other tertiary institutions) are supposed to move from Shs670,000 to Shs1.1m as their science counterparts will get an extra Shs100,000. Head teachers of primary schools and graduate teachers under U4 scale will earn Shs1.7m while their science teaching counterparts will get Shs2.2m.Head teachers of secondary schools and principals of certificate awarding institutions are supposed to get Shs2.6m. Heads of diploma awarding institutions are supposed to earn Shs3.1m. The proposed teachers  salary increment will cost government Shs22b. The teachers started negotiations for their salary increment in 2011 following a strike that paralysed all public schools in the country.The then Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi promised a phased increment in three consecutive financial years. However, the teachers have struggled to realise the 50 per cent salary increment they settled for more than eight years ago.NO RAISE FOR 3 YEARSWhile updating the public on NRM Manifesto implementation on education last week, the Education Minister, Ms Janet Museveni, said government had not increased salaries for primary teachers because their pay in 2016/17 put them above the pay target in the pay policy approved by Cabinet.  There has been no salary enhancement for primary school teachers in the last three years because increment prior to Financial year 2016/17 put them above the pay targets in the pay policy approved by cabinet,  Ms Museveni said.

2,IPOD delegates instruct Parliament to amend parties Act - Daily Monitor,"Entebbe- Delegates at the Monday Interparty Organisation for Dialogue (IPOD) Summit, who endured almost 10 hours while waiting for the arrival of President Yoweri Museveni, have instructed Parliament to amend the controversial Public Order Management Act (POMA), to curtail police brutality towards Opposition groups.The summit that was held at Protea Hotel in Entebbe, was attended by President Museveni the chairman of the National Resistance Movement (NRM), Mr Jimmy Akena, the leader of Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC), Mr Muhammad Kibirige Mayanja; who represented Justice Forum (Jeema) leader, Mr Asuman Basalirwa and Mr Norbert Mao the Democratic Party president. Mr Mao is the current chairman of IPOD. The Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) was not represented since the party announced last week that the meeting was an insignificant  social event . In a joint statement after a four-hour summit, the leaders agreed that amendments to POMA be tabled in Parliament within two months, to reduce the powers of the Inspector General of Police (IGP).In its current form, the law gives the IGP sole authority to Opposition politicians and activists to hold public rallies and meetings anywhere in Uganda.POMA was in 2005 passed without regulations on how it would be implemented which allowed police to take it upon themselves to decide whether a political meeting by Opposition groups takes place or not, yet they are only supposed to be notified about such gatherings.IPOD delegates instructed the Prime Minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda, the leader of government business in Parliament, to table the POMA amendments which will spell out regulations how the law would be implemented. The National Security Council will also get the proposed amendments to enable its members contribute to the proposals. In the proposed amendments that were pushed by Opposition parties, who have been victims of police brutality, district police commanders will only be only about a political gathering not less than 48 hours to the event.The IPOD Summit also adopted the proposal for candidates seeking to contest as independents to resign from their respective political parties, 12 months prior to elections.The move is intended to help political parties to block supporters from running as independent candidates immediately after losing party primary elections, where flag bearers are chosen.On other electoral reforms, it was agreed during that candidates who are sponsored by political parties should not be required to get signatures from voters before being nominated.The meeting also agreed to review nomination fees for candidates to make vying for political offices more affordable and inclusive.Currently, aspirants intending to contest for Member of Parliament are supposed to pay Shs3 million as nomination fee while presidential candidates have to pay Shs20 million.The delegates also suggested that nomination fees for losing candidates should be refunded; and courts of law to conclude hearing of election petitions for parliamentarian elections within one year.It was also agreed that newly-created constituencies and administrative units should only hold elections in a specified period of any given year or to hold such elections in the next election cycle to avoid costs and disruption of electioneering.Earlier, President Museveni asked Opposition politicians to embrace such meetings and dialogue because it is such platforms where pertinent political issues are discussed. Mr Museveni also said there is need for Opposition politicians to start working for their constituents instead of only concentrating on debating national matters. ""Don't waste time claiming you are opposition and you are doing nothing to the people,"" be said, adding that when he was still a youth and a supporter of DP, he worked for his people in the current Kiruhura District while opposing UPC leadership. Mr Museveni used the meeting to scold the leadership of FDC who once again boycotted the meeting, yet the party is a member of IPOD. If you are in leadership and then say I don't want to talk, then go home and graze cows. For me, when you call for dialogue, I will be there the following morning. It is a biblical command to talk,"" he said.Mr Mao also accused the FDC of practicing  brinkmanship   with their leader, Mr Patrick Amuriat Oboi boycotting the summit even when they fully participated in the IPOD Council meetings where the Monday agenda was approved. ""I call upon the FDC to change the attitude of boycotting. What they are doing is brinkmanship just to allow situations escalate. We don't come to table of dialogue because of fear, we come here filled with confidence,"" he said.He said that all the parties under the IPOD Summit, including FDC have already received Shs1 billion from the Netherlands Institute of Multiparty Democracy to help them on development and mobilization of party supporters. Mr Mao, also wondered how Mr Museveni can  comfortably preside  over a country soaked in corruption to the extent that even a 7-year-old singer Fresh Kid has composed songs about Uganda s misarable situation.

3,Women activists demand Justice official to quit office - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. Women activists yesterday demanded that deputy Solicitor General Christopher Gashirabake, who is in the storm of alleged sexual harassment of a junior female staff, should step down to pave way for the ongoing investigations into the matter.While addressing the press in Kampala the women activists, under Chapter 4 Uganda, said the position Mr Gashirabake is holding is powerful and is likely to influence the investigations to his advantage. Mr Gashirabake is under investigation by the Sexual Harassment Committee after a junior staff Senior State Attorney, Ms Samantha Mwesigye, accused him of sexually harassing her since her internship when he was her supervisor. Given this absurd unfolding of events, we the women of Uganda, therefore, demand that the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs, treats Ms Mwesigye s complaint with urgency. We ask the accused (Mr Gashirabake) to step down pending completion of the investigations,  the women activists charged yesterday.DemonstrationsThey held placards reading: respect women s bodies, Gashirabake should step down, violence free workplaces for all, stop sexual harassment , women get sexually harassed at workplaces every day, we are breaking the silence   Ms Tina Musuya, the executive director of Centre for Domestic Violence Prevention (CEDOVIP), cautioned parents about their daughters whom she said are the most sexually harassed at work places given their naivety. Sexual harassment happens widely. Unfortunately, those who come up to speak against it, are victimised. When we come to workplaces, as women we need to be treated with dignity,  Ms Musuya urged male staff. First, we commend Ms Mwesigye for the courage to speak up against sexual harassment in employment. It s no easy feat. By speaking up, She has given courage to several women and girls to claim their voices and demand safer workplaces and started a movement against acceptability and normalisation of sexual harassment in our workplaces,  Ms Sarah Birete, a women rights activist said.When Daily Monitor contacted the Solicitor General, Mr Francis Atoke, on whether he would ask his deputy to step down as investigations are ongoing, he said he could not comment because he was out of the country.Some of the women activists also decried how men needlessly  badtouch  them when they go shopping in town and said this must stop.Anna Ebaju Adeke, Youth MP, said it is a shame for the Justice Ministry which is supposed to be a custodian of law and constitutionalism to be caught in such embarrassing conduct.Ms Mwesigye, who was in the company of the women activists, assured her alleged tormentors of how she will not be silenced and insisted she has overwhelming evidence to prove her claims.She said Mr Gashirabake needs to clean up his conduct.She also took a swipe at the Solicitor General for allegedly lying that she had not approached him about the alleged sexual harassment and instead went to the media. Atoke let me down, the Justice ministry has let me down, Prime Minister has let me down, the World Bank have not helped me. Did Atoke want me to wait for three years in order to go to the media   Ms Mwesigye charged.Mr Gashirabake has since declined to comment on the sexual harassment allegations against him.The caseOn March 6, 2019, Ms Mwesigye petitioned Prime Minister Dr Ruhakana Rugunda saying her supervisor Mr Gashirabake started sexually harassing her when he supervised her as a clerkship student and has continued this behaviour.According to the Employment (Sexual Harassment) Regulations, 2012, sexual harassment involves a direct or implicit request to an employee for sexual intercourse, sexual contact or any other form of sexual activity; use of language whether written or spoken of sexual nature such as unwelcome verbal advances, sexual oriented comments, request for sexual favours, jokes of sexual nature among others.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Women-activists-demand-Justice-official-quit-office/688334-5124222-8imotcz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post3.png
4,Amin s regime comes to life in photo exhibition - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. On Saturday, Uganda Broadcasting Corporations in conjunction with the Uganda Museum launched an exhibition that is showcasing unpublished pictures from the Amin regime.Many of these had been recorded films and photo negatives that had been archived at UBC for nearly 40 years.During his regime, Amin is said to have had one of the most advanced media industries on the continent, he had seen the national broadcaster move from black and white to colour and boosted Radio Uganda.Because of that relationship Amin tried to build with the media, keeping photographers around him, much of the exhibition that is aptly titled  The Unseen Archive of Idi Amin  is from the media s point of view.The showcase is a collection of photos describing different stages of the regime such as the expulsion of Asians, the economic war, flagging off artistes to different festivals while others are of senior government officials such as Moses Ali and Nasur Abdallah.The exhibition that kicked off with a symposium brought together some of the people that worked with Amin at the Uganda Museum.Government officials.

The exhibition will be at the Uganda Museum until November 30 and will later be moved to different parts of the country before heading back to the museum in about two years.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Amin-s-regime-comes-life-photo-exhibition/688334-5124208-k4s6nvz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post4.png
5,Government denies deal with South Africa over Pato trial - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The arrest and extradition of key suspect in Susan Magara murder still remains a mystery given the fact that South African law does not allow deportation of a suspect on a charge to where he or she is likely to face death penalty unless there is written commitment from the home country that the accused will not get such a sentence upon conviction. Patrick Kasaija, alias Pato, was extradited from South Africa last week on charges of murder and kidnap with intent to procure a ransom. In Uganda, murder attracts up to a death sentence. In September 2011, the South Africa Constitutional Court blocked extradition of two Botswana nationals facing murder charges at home on account that their deportation was unconstitutional without written assurance from the government of Botswana that they  will not face the death penalty there under any circumstance .However, in the case of Kasaija, the Uganda Police Force and the Director of Public Prosecutions, said they did not make any assurance to South Africa for Pato to be extradited home. Police spokesperson Commissioner Fred Enanga said they submitted their request for the extradition and secured a court warrant and later, an Interpol Red Notice without making an assurance to the South African government about the penalty Kasaija would face if found guilty and convicted. There were no proposals made by South Africa or us. Our Inspector General of Police and Director of Public Prosecutions wrote to their counterparts in South Africa that he (Pato) was a fugitive wanted in the investigation of the death of Susan Magara,  Mr Enanga said.The deputy spokesperson of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Ms Irene Nakimbugwe, said they did not hold any negotiations for such assurances with their South African counterparts.Efforts to talk to South African officer-in-charge of Media Relations in Johannesburg Brig Vish Naido were futile. His assistant, who picked our calls, said he was in a meeting.Co-acccusedKasaija is charged jointly with Yusuf Lubega, 32, (a boda boda rider), Hussein Wasswa, 22, (a hawker), Muzamiru Ssali, 27, (boda boda rider), Hajara Nakandi, 35, (a teacher), Abubaker Kyewolwa, 30, (a businessman), Mahad Kasalita (an Imam at Usafi Mosque), Hassan Kato Miiro, 22, and Ismail Bukenya (businessman).

6,Police ask Nantaba to make new statement - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Police have asked the State Minister for ICT, Ms Idah Nantaba, to allow detectives record a new statement days after she made allegations that State agents are baying for her blood. Police spokesperson Fred Enanga said the first statement that Ms Nantaba made was her own narrative, which was not subjected to qualified detectives  queries. We want to encourage her to allow our team to get a detailed account of what happened on that day,  Mr Enanga said yesterday.Addressing a congregation at Bukolooto Seventh Day Adventist Church in Kayunga Town at the weekend, Ms Nantaba claimed that Ronald Ssebulime, who was killed extra-judicially by police officers on allegations of trailing her, was armed and had intentions to kill her.She also alleged that a police officer, Cpl Edward Ssali, was called on mobile phone by a state agent who ordered him to kill Ssebulime to stop him from leaking information about the alleged assassination scheme against her.Ms Nantaba said the  truth is that the killers are within security and government. The masterminds, she said, are highly-placed government and security officials who are  untouchable,  a reference in Uganda s politics to individuals in the top circles of government and state.But Mr Enanga said Ms Nantaba has not reported to police any threat against her life or that Ssebulime was a victim of the assassination scheme.  It is unfortunate that she is talking about threats in her life in the media. Let her come out and make these threats in writing,  he said.After the shooting of Ssebulime, the CID director summoned Ms Nantaba to record a statement, but she declined, saying President Museveni had ordered her not to leave her home.She later wrote her own narrative of the incident, which she sent to police.Mr Enanga said call data on the mobile phones of the accused officer were retrieved and don t support Ms Nantaba s allegations that there is a superior officer who ordered him to kill Ssebulime. It was a case of mistaken identity. If she isn t comfortable with the police, she can engage other security agencies to investigate,  he said. LinksThe then Inspector General of Police, Gen Kale Kayihura, whom President Museveni fired early last year after publicly scolding him that the force he superintended had been infiltrated by  criminal elements , blamed the high-profile killings on ADF elements.He did not provided evidence, and minister Nantaba on the weekend punched holes in the allegations.

7,MPs stuck as Budget hits Shs40.5 trillion - Daily Monitor,"Parliament. Business in the Budget Committee of Parliament has stalled with MPs rocked by disagreements on whether to directly adopt an additional Shs1 trillion without having it scrutinised by sectoral committees.The stand-off comes two days to the Thursday deadline when the committee is expected to present the Budget to Parliament for final approval.According to national budget timelines, the committee was supposed to have tabled the revised estimates on May 15, but due to unexpected mishaps, the Deputy Speaker, Mr Jacob Oulanyah, extended the deadline.Parliament is mandated to debate and pass the Budget by May 30 under the Public Finance Management Act 2015.The Shs39.5 trillion budget was presented to Parliament, but with an addition, it is expected to rise to Shs40.5 trillion. The addendum is yet to be officially presented to MPs except for a copy submitted to the Office Clerk. We cannot discuss this matter before it is officially tabled on the floor of Parliament,  Mr Amos Lugoloobi, the committee chairperson, said.  We wanted to beat the deadline and certainly we shall have to adjust [it],  he added.A section of MPs argued that it would be wrong for the committee to process a corrigendum that has not been tabled, yet it has not gone through the committee on Finance. This is a legal matter, this committee has no powers legally to talk about something that is not available,  Ms Cecilia Ogwal (Dokolo, FDC) said. We don t have the mandate except if we are only chatting,  she added.Mr Muwanga Kivumbi (Butambala, DP) advised against flouting the law. I don t know why matters are being referred directly to the Budget committee. Now agencies are finding their way out to skip scrutiny at sectoral level, direct to the Budget committee,  he said.The matter is expected to be addressed today with the official tabling of the Budget addendum.Why Shs1 trillion addition Finance minister Matia Kasaija in the addendum has made fresh alterations to the main Budget suggesting new requirements that lead to a rise in the earlier proposed funds. One of the items included is a Shs105b request for a digital stamp and e-system for the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). Yesterday, the committee had scheduled to meet Ms Doris Akol, the URA Commissioner General to explain the new requirement, but the meeting flopped.

""We estimate there are up to 50 million Nigerians with no access to bank accounts.""The flotation comes after years of difficulty in Nigeria, with MTN battling mammoth fines by the country's regulators.In December 2018, MTN agreed to pay $53 million to resolve a row with Nigeria's telecoms regulator (NCC), after being accused of illegally repatriating $8.13 billion to South Africa.The decision to impose fines shocked MTN and its foreign investors, with four commercial banks involved in the transfer also fined.The sanction was the latest in a series of fines to hit MTN since it began operations in Nigeria 17 years ago.In 2015 it was fined $5.2 billion in 2015 for failing to disconnect unregistered SIM cards on its network.The fine was later reduced to $1.7 billion after negotiations with the Nigerian government.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Telecom-giant-MTN-lists-shares-Nigeria-s-stock-exchange/688340-5120556-dag39uz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post11.png
12,Government in talks with Amin family over Arua airport expansion - Daily Monitor,"ARUA. The government is holding discussions with the family of former president Idi Amin to acquire large chunks of land for the expansion of Arua airport to international standards.Officials from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) say discussions have progressed well and they will soon enter an agreement.Mr Samuel Wonekha, the CAA general manager for regional airports, said he is hopeful that both parties will come to an agreeable position very soon. The issue of land in Arua; after we carried out the detailed master plan for the airport, the master plan dictated that some additional land must be acquired to implement the plan and we are actually looking for additional land,  said Mr Wonekha. Part of this land actually belongs to the former head of state. The family of late president Idi Amin own most of the land around the airport. We are moving on well with the talks and hope to secure this land very soon,  he added. CAA plansMr Wonekha said once the land is acquired, they will embark on the construction of the terminals and runways to accommodate different sizes of the planes. CAA wants to upgrade the airfield to Category 4C airport, which has field length of more than 1,800 metres.The category 4C airport can accommodate a plane of wing length of up to 24 metres. Arua airport currently has length of 1,800m, and officials from the CAA say the master plan demands that more land be availed to make the airport meet the required specifications.On delays to complete the compensation of those who own land near the airport, Mr Wonekha admitted that some rejected the initial government offer, while others have no letters of administration because the owners of the land died. In our report, we indicated that we have effected payment so far up to 98 per cent. For the 11 members, who have not been compensated yet, there are issues that range from the fact that the estates changed because people passed on and they are to secure letters of administration before their proper settlement. We also have people who objected to the value of their properties, which are under review by the government chief valuer and we are getting positive data from those affected and soon we are going to effect their payments,  he said. Mr Wonekha also said government is currently soliciting for $56m (Shs209.2b) for the general upgrading of the airport to meet the regional and international standards. He said the major works have been delayed because government has not secured the required funds. Government is still sourcing for financing of about $56m that will enable us to begin on the actual major project of upgrading the airport in Arua. However, the smaller components of the projects are ongoing but the major works will start when we receive the funding,  he said.Strategic position Arua is the second busiest domestic airport in the country after Entebbe, with a monthly average of 180 air traffic movements. Presently, Eagle Air operates scheduled flights with a 19- seater aircraft. Ad hoc and charter flights are also operated by Mission Aviation Fellowship, United Nations, AIM Air, Samaritan Purse and Kampala Aero Club and Flight Training Centre.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-talks-with-Amin-family-Arua-airport-expansion/688334-5123910-mcn44yz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post16.png
13,UPC to punish members for endorsing Museveni s sole candidature - Daily Monitor,"OYAM. The Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC) party has said it will discipline some of its members who recently endorsed President Museveni as the sole candidate for the 2021 presidential elections. On May 16, leaders of the Opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and UPC in Lango sub-region reportedly seconded a resolution, endorsing Mr Museveni as the sole candidate for the forthcoming elections. When the President convened a meeting at Oyam Boma grounds for all the local leaders in Lango sub-region to deliver his message of wealth creation, the resolution to endorse him for 2021 was moved by NRM and seconded by FDC and UPC members. Mr Ogwal Ojok, the NRM chairperson for Oyam District, read out a bi-partisan resolution, endorsing Mr Museveni as the sole candidate.Mr Ojok was seconded by Mr Onac Okello, the Kwania District chairperson (UPC), Mr Brian Ogutu, the Oyam District councillor and FDC chairperson; Mr Celestine Ouma, the Oyam District councillor (UPC), and Mr Masor Bashir, the male councillor (UPC). The UPC secretary general, Mr Fred Ebil Ebil, warned that the UPC leaders who endorsed Mr Museveni s sole candidature in the 2021 elections would face disciplinary action. Mr Ebil Ebil said the UPC regional office will this week convene a meeting of district party chairpersons to discuss the matter.  This is because those individuals do not hold any authority to make decisions on behalf of the country s oldest political party rather than the UPC National Council,  he said yesterday.  We are looking for evidence to pin those UPC members who were reported in the media to have endorsed Mr Museveni as sole candidate for 2021,  UPC secretary general added.According to Mr Ebil Ebil, UPC has never endorsed any presidential candidate because the party is also preparing to front their candidate for the top most political seat. We are not supporting anybody who has shown interest to contest for presidential elections of 2021 apart from UPC candidate,  he said in an interview.  But if the Opposition political parties decide to form a coalition and front a single candidate for presidency, that position can only be determined by the National Council of UPC but not anybody else,  he added. The Member of Parliament for Erute South in Lira District, Mr Jonathan Odur, said the people who are purported to have endorsed President Museveni on behalf of Lango to fulfil their selfish gains should be publicly condemned.  Less than 1 per cent of Langi cannot claim to have endorsed [President] Museveni without making any consultations in all the constituencies. These are people who are money hungry who have just joined NRM and they are trying to show that they are more powerful than those who were in NRM before,  Mr Odur said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UPC-punish-members-endorsing-Museveni-s-sole-candidature/688334-5123954-fhrmxoz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post17.png
14,Government starts relocation of Bududa landslide victims to Bulambuli - Daily Monitor,"Bududa. The truck groans and squeaks as it climbs the murram road. Perched on atop, between pieces of furniture and assorted personal effects.In the vans are men, women and children anxious to reach the promised land.  As perilous as it seems, this journey is a flight to safety. After months in makeshift camps, survivors of recent landslides on the slopes of Mt Elgon in eastern Uganda are finally being relocated to permanent homes in safer areas.   This is the day we have been waiting for,  said Mr Boaz Mutinye, a landslide survivor and head of Shisambwa Village in Bukalasi Sub-county.  We will live here happily with no life threats posed by the landslides,  he said. The relocation began slowly, with 10 households of 60 people moved to Bunambutye in Bulambuli District, where the government, through the Office of the Prime Minister, has built new homes.A few remain in temporary camps while more than 10,000 are living in their homes, which are at risk of landslides. About 100 households will be relocated over the next two weeks in the first phase. Each household will get a two-bedroom house on an acre of land, with another two acres for agriculture. The move has rescued survivors  from the jaws of death , says Ms Lydia Nandudu, who lost family members in the most recent landslide in Bukalasi.  We have been having sleepless nights whenever it rains. We will now sleep without disruptions,  she said, breaking out in a gospel song. Mr Isaac Mugera, an OPM spokesman, said heavy rain and difficult terrain had delayed the resettlement. BenefitsThe government, he said, will feed the families for a year, long enough for them to grow and harvest their own food.  A health centre has also been built nearby for the communities, although the recent arrivals will have to find places in area schools, as the new term is about to open. The UPDF s Engineering Brigade built the houses between December and March. Some 900 houses will be built at a cost of Shs32 billion on the 2,800-acre piece of land government acquired in 2013 as part of a 10-year resettlement plan. The plan has not been without challenges: residents attached to their ancestral lands and are reluctant to leave their landslide-prone homes, while disputes remain over the ownership and suitability of some of the resettlement land. For those lucky enough to get onto the relocation trucks, however, the relatively short journey away from the mountain slopes is a giant leap from danger and a chance to break new ground.ReallocationThe construction of 101 houses by the Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) Engineering Brigade and police s construction unit, started on December 15, 2018 and they were completed by March, 2019. According to the resettlement scheme on the 2,800 acres of land, which the government acquired in 2013, 250 houses will be constructed on Plot 94, which measures 270 acres. Plot 157, which is 918 acres, will house 650 houses, while Plot 198, measuring 1,688 acres, will be reserved for mechanised agricultural production.

15,"Ntagali condemns theft of public funds, immorality - Daily Monitor","Butebo/Tororo. The Church of Uganda Archbishop, the Rt Rev Stanley Ntagali, has decried gross misappropriation of public funds that has led to loss of taxpayers  money.The prelate made the remarks while bidding farewell to Christians of Bukedi Diocese at St John s Church of Uganda, the headquarters of Butebo Archdeaconry, at the weekend.He warned against amassing wealth through dubious means and encouraged believers to work hard.  The negative attitude towards work coupled with the prevailing poverty have fuelled corruption through stealing of public funds,  Archbishop Ntagali said. People should instead work hard to own their properties. I strongly condemn the increasing theft of funds. The raging immorality is becoming another cancer that is increasingly eating up society; for instance, I did strongly oppose homosexuality and became an enemy to some donors who had proposed to impose this act on us,  he addedFirm on Church position I have no apology for having stood strong to protect the church from these evil acts. I therefore salute the House of Bishops for being behind me in this struggle to oppose homosexuality. We need to stand on the biblical truth that requires man to marry a woman and not man to man or woman to woman. This is totally against the canons of the Bible and should strongly be rejected. The Archbishop first laid a foundation stone at St Philip Church of Uganda in Kawojan, Kabwangasi Parish, Butebo, where 90 per cent of the works have been funded by the family of Ms Elizabeth Aisu.A brass band then led the procession of hundreds of believers through Butebo Trading Centre, up to the venue, which was approximately about 4kms, as Christians endured the scorching sunshine.The Archbishop asked Christians to pray for Uganda. The country is faced with many challenges. We need to pray for them and for the new Bishop of Soroti Diocese, who is awaiting consecration,  Archbishiop Ntagali said.In TororoWhile in Tororo District , the prelate said the continuous demand for the carving out of administrative units in the Anglican Church is a clear demonstration of the growing faith.He said already in the pipeline is the outstanding approval for carving out of East Busoga Diocese and West Rwenzori Diocese, which will increase the number of dioceses from the current 37 to 39. When I was enthroned the Archbishop of Church of Uganda, they were only 34 but out of demand for self-autonomy by Christians. I managed to carve more three and recently Christians initiated carving of two more dioceses, which I have okayed and they are likely to be inaugurated before I retire,   Archbishop Ntagali said.The Archbishop has been in Bukedi Diocese on his final tour ahead of his retirement in March 1, 2020.He commended Christians of Bukedi Diocese for the commitment and strong faith that has helped the diocese grow stronger, which has been evidenced by creation of archdeaconries and parishes.Church of Uganda constitution requires that at 65 years, one is mandated to retire.In June 2012, Archbishop Ntagali was elected by two thirds majority as the 8th Archbishop of the Church of Uganda. The election was presided over by Rt Rev Nicodemus Okille, the Dean of the Church of the Province of Uganda. Previous ArchbishopsPrevious Archbishops of the Church of Uganda are Leslie Brown, a British missionary, was the first Archbishop of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Boga-Zaire [1961-1966], Erch Sabiti [1966-1974], Janani Luwum [1974-1977-martyred in 1977, Silvanus Wani [1977-1983].

16,500 residents share one borehole - Daily Monitor,"Luweero. More than 500 people in Katagwe Parish, Kamira Sub- county, Luweero District, spend about six hours queuing at one borehole to get water while hundreds of others share an abandoned dam with animals. Mothers are failing to engage in any productive work because they spend it lining up at the borehole,  Mr Ponsiano Katumba, the Katagwe chairperson, said during a village meeting at the weekend.  Sometimes we have to escort our wives at night to line up at the borehole where they spend more than six hours before returning home. Many residents have resorted to using dirty water shared with animals,  he added.Mr Patrick Mwesigye, the Kamira councillor, said the situation has compromised the health of residents. We have repeatedly petitioned the district authorities to provide more safe water sources with little success. The few shallow wells drilled by the district water department dried up just a few months after being commissioned,  Mr Mwesigye said. Ms Rebecca Nakanjako, a resident of Katagwe, said women are at risk of being raped since they move late at night.The State Minister for Local Government, Ms Jenipher Namuyangu, tasked district leaders to address the challenge. The district should prioritise the well-being of residents by ensuring they have safe water. It is the duty of the leaders to be transparent and ensure that the residents get to know about all the projects being implemented including the accountability component,  Ms Namuyangu said.Mr Henry Musisi, the district assistant chief administrative officer, attributed the low safe water coverage in the area due to the low water table resulting from the poor bed rock that does not favour establishment of shallow wells. The district is, however, sourcing for additional funding to ensure that these areas get the deep bore holes. Each deep borehole costs about Shs19m. The district plans to allocate more funds for the safe water sources for Kamira in the new financial year 2019/2020,  Mr Musisi said.Early this month, the district leaders said they had partnered with the National Water and Sewerage Corporation to extend piped water to all remote villages, especially in the cattle corridor areas. Under the partnership, the district has already committed more than Shs30m to extend piped water to Lutuula, Namatogonya, Kiiya, Lukinzi and Lusanja villages in Butuntumula Sub-county. Water coverageCurrently, clean piped water is only accessible by 27.5 per cent of the district population in Luweero Town, Wobulenzi, Bombo, Zirobwe, Kikyusa and Bamunanika. Last year, NWSC secured Shs15b to extend piped water to more 406 villages in Luweero, Wobulenzi, Semuto, Bombo, Kapeeka and Zirobwe.Statistics from the district water office indicate that about 76 per cent of the total population depend on water point sources.

17,UPDF takes over security at Kawolo hospital - Daily Monitor,"Buikwe. Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) have been deployed at Kawolo hospital in Buikwe District to crack down on the theft of building materials following a public request.The health facility is currently undergoing renovation and expansion.Residents and the hospital administration through the Resident District Commissioner, Ms Jane Frances Kagayi, called for the army s intervention after efforts by a private security company and police proved futile.Thugs have been stealing cement, iron bars, doors, solar panels and taps, among other materials.Daily Monitor learnt that private guards and police officers were withdrawn on May 9 while at least 20 UPDF soldiers from UPDF Engineering Brigade, Lugazi took over. Dr Joshua Kiberu, the hospital medical superintendent, said the deployment will improve security. The situation has been terrible, some of us could not catch sleep ever since the renovation works started. Now that the soldiers are here, we know they are going to solve this problem (theft),  Dr Kiberu said in an interview last week. Those people (thieves) have been stealing anything they could come across, and we were getting worried that one time, they might steal our patients,   he added. Dr Kiberu also said they are now challenged with replacing stolen items from the new buildings that have already been handed over. The contractor has been handing over whatever building he completes so that we can start using them for our daily operations. It is from these buildings where expensive items such as solar panels and doors, among others things, have been stolen,  he said.Dr Kiberu said the administration is yet to compute the amount of money lost in the theft.The renovation works are being undertaken by Excel Construction Company Ltd at a tune of Shs39b.Brig Richard Karemire, the UPDF spokesperson, said he was not aware of the deployment and referred us to UPDF officers at Gaddafi Barracks in Jinja District.Ms Kagayi, who chairs the district security committee, said deployment was a last resort. It was a hard decision to take, but we had nothing to do. Let our people cooperate with them (soldiers) by giving them information about that racket of stealing building materials,  she said.ReliefMr Steven Kikawula Mugoya, a councillor representing Kiwawula Ward at Lugazi Municipality, welcomed the deployment.  They have taken so long to come, but it is good they have responded and we do not expect to hear any more stealing of property,   Mr Mugoya said.A soldier, who talked to this newspaper on condition of anonymity since he is not the authorised to speak to the press, urged patients and caregivers not worry about their presence, saying they are there to restore sanity. We act differently in situations like this. So, those who have been surviving on stealing from this government facility, they should not dare step here again,   the army officer said.About hospitalKawolo hospital had not received major renovation since 1968. The hospital administrator, Dr Joshua Kiberu, said more than 90 per cent of the renovation works have been done, adding that fixing some machines and erection of a perimeter wall are left. Among the new facilities constructed are a trauma centre, a modern mortuary, new out-patient block, four staff houses and two operating theatres. The hospital has also been boosted with harvest tanks. The project, which will officially be handed over to government later this year, is funded by the Spanish government.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UPDF-takes-over-security-Kawolo-hospital/688334-5122560-2qyyvk/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post21.png
18,Nema vows to arrest wetland encroachers - Daily Monitor,"Kayunga. Encroachers who recently reclaimed a section of Ssezibwa wetland in Kayunga and Mukono districts face arrest, National Environment Management (Nema) officials have said.More than 500 people were evicted from the area in December last year.However, Mr Nicholas Magara, the Nema coordinator of wetland matters in the central region, said the encroachers have failed to respect the commitment. Last year, we were lenient and didn t arrest them. However, this time we are going to arrest and prosecute them and no one is going to blame us,  Mr Magara said last week.Section 36 of the National Environment Act provides for the protection of wetlands and prohibits reclamation, erection of illegal structures and empowers authorities to demolish any structure that is fixed in, on, under or above any wetland. The Kayunga environment officer, Mr Patrick Musaazi, said they are working with the Resident District Commissioner, District Internal Security Officer and the environment police to take action against the encroachers. We don t want any political interference when time comes to arrest those people,  Mr Musaazi said.A source within the police in Kayunga said a letter had been written to the commandant of the environmental protection unit in February about the issue, but said he had not received a response.Plead for leniency Some encroachers said they were forced back to cultivate in the wetland due to lack of arable land. We are landless yet we have to pay school fees for our children. We ask the President to allow us to grow crops because we have nowhere to go,  Mr Moses Mukisa, a resident, said.Statistics show that the country has lost more than 30 per cent of its wetlands in the last 23 years.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Nema-vows-arrest-wetland-encroachers/688334-5122568-30j940z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post22.png

Speaking on Thursday during the inauguration of Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd in Atiak Sub-county, Amuru District, Ms Kyambadde said many women in the region shy away from venturing into business opportunities that would turn profitable and change their lives because they fear losing money. Be ready to take risks, if you don t take risks, you will not be anywhere, take that risk to start a business and succeed,  she said adding that most of the successful people around the world took risks.Ms Kyambadde cited Amina Moghe Hersi, who is establishing Atiak Sugar Factory in Amuru saying she took a risk to start her investment.She lauded the outgrowers for venturing into sugarcane growing since the sugar industry is one of the key industries in East Africa citing that in Uganda, sugar production has increased by 10 per cent from 240,000 metric tonnes in 2008 to now 430,000 metric tonnes currently.Ms Kyambadde promised to help women outgrowers dealing in the production of honey, Shea butter oil, ground nut butter and crafts with fast tracking certification of their products.Ms Joyce Santa Laker, the chairperson Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd, said four districts are now directly implementing sugarcane growing citing Adjumani, Lamwo, Gulu and Amuru.She noted that their ultimate goal is to change the mind-set of the community and engage them in productivity.Ms Amina Moghe Hersi, the owner of Atiak Sugar Factory, told women that the region will now be the food basket of Africa since they will produce all food crops.Cooperative membershipThe Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd comprises 4,070 members, majority of whom are women from Acholi Sub-region and Adjumani District, who were former abductees, sex workers, persons with disability, HIV/Aids persons and those from nodding syndrome families.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Take-risk-succeed-business-Kyambadde/688334-5122600-kigj8e/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post24.png

The Bishop of Kinkiizi Diocese, Rt Rev Dan Zoreka, has said the future of the country will depend on the shaping of the young generation, and asked parents and community members to end child neglect and abuse.Officiating at the opening of a four-day women s conference in Kihihi Archdeaconry organised by Rev Ven Justus Tibesigwa on Friday, Bishop Zoreka said children have been neglected and parents do not talk to them to show them the right way. He added that the conditions children are living in are not favourable for their prosperity. Our children today are abused, they are given work that doesn t suit them, many have been neglected, abused and are subjected to torture. Praise God if you see yourself still doing well for your children.  These children will be here when we are not. As a nation, we must rise and work together to nurture the children so that when time comes, we get gifts from them,  Bishop Zoreka said.He said parents need to create time for their children and instil in them good values instead of trusting schools. He added:  These days, there are many things that pull us away; many parents are busy, they are looking for money in all ways. A parent can be busy and the whole week passes without talking to their children. The conference attracted more than 1,500 women from various parishes. Topics covered include attitude change, confidence-building, economic empowerment and personal development.  You can t nurture a child without money, you must be empowered economically; you can t parent when you don t have food thus you must be a hardworking mother who has food; you can t nurture a child when you are not a good example you must be a good example as a mother and a parent so that when a child is being nurtured, he sees you as a symbol of love,  Bishop Zoreka said.Businessman James Musinguzi Garuga asked women to develop self-confidence and should not take husbands as providers but partners in development if they want their families to succeed.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Bishop-Zoreka-decries-child-neglect-abuse/688334-5122680-rgn9cfz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post25.png
22,Theatres close over lack of staff - Daily Monitor,"KAKUMIRO. Kakumiro District health centres have abandoned key medical and surgical operations as their only theatres remain closed over lack of technical staff.Kakumiro District only has two well equipped theatres at Kakumiro and Kakindo health centre IVs in Kakumiro and Kakindo town councils, respectively. They all serve about 350,000 people. The crisis of key theatre staff such as anesthetists and theatre assistants has left the theatres closed for about a year.Key surgeries such as hernia, caesarean operation on expectant mothers and critical life threatening injuries cannot be handled there and patients are referred to either Mubende or Hoima regional referral hospitals, which are about an hour s drive away. The in-charge of Kakindo Health Centre, Dr Hargreaves Byaruhanga, said the theatre has been closed because of lack of key staff and this has left people to suffer with referrals. We have been raising our concerns ever since Infectious Diseases institute (IDI) stopped the  Saving Mothers, Giving Life  project, that was supporting us with staff. Later, everything came to a standstill,   Dr Byaruhanga said. He added:  Some expectant mothers have died or lost their babies because we refer them to Hoima or Mubende and these are distant places. We understand the pain our people are enduring and yet all their concerns would be attended to at our theatre here  .Ms Jane Kamagara, a resident of Kalangala Village, Kibijo Sub-county, Kagadi District, said her daughter lost a baby after she was referred to Mubende hospital and she reached late and doctors could not save her unborn baby.Ms Vastina Kabarungi, a resident of Irora Village in Kiryanga Sub-county, in the neighbouring Kagadi District, said she had battled hernia infection for years but she could not get operated on at Kakindo Health Centre IV because of the challenges at the theatre.Her life was saved last week when Adalante Africa, a non-government organisation held a free surgical camp with doctors from Spain. Dr Israel Kyejimbo, the in-charge at Kakumiro Health centre IV in Kakumiro Town Council, said the crisis has also affected operations at the health facility.  It is true that our theatre has not been working for about one year and the problem started when IDI withdrew the personnel support. We nowadays refer all cases necessitating surgery to Mubende hospital. We have received several cases of expectant mothers suffering ruptured uterus and others losing their babies because of delayed attention and poor transport system,   Dr Kyejimbo said.The Kakumiro District health officer, Dr Robert Senteza, said:   We have a known challenge for human resource in health in the district due to inadequate wage bill especially of critical staff gaps in that area of service of the theatre. With all stakeholders at all levels aware of this service delivery hiccup, joint collective efforts are on and the population should remain calm and hopeful as we try our best for the best,   Dr Senteza said.The Kakumiro District Chief Administrative Officer, Mr Stephen Monday, said the need for key staff at the health centers has been included in the next financial year recruitment plan.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Theatres-close-over-lack-staff/688334-5122686-158drrhz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post26.png
23,Uganda Pentecostal pastors urged to go for theological training - Daily Monitor,"Uganda Pentecostal pastors have been urged to embrace the doctrine of unity as preached by Jesus Christ and stop building empires on individual bases. According to Pastors Discipleship Network executive director, Dr Richmond Wandera, there is individuality of building institutions and empires for individual pastors who have forgotten the doctrine of unity.Dr Wandera made the remarks on Saturday at the end of a cross-country marathon in which about 200 pastors participated in the 13km race from Luzira to Bweyogerere and 450km race that took nine days from Nimule in South Sudan to Luzira in Kampala.He said there are many mistakes that pastors have made due to ignorance and therefore, need trainings to create awareness for the struggling pastors.""There are many mistakes made by pastors and yet the job of a pastor is to preach accurately, teach and disciple well and also lead people,"" he said.He said a mistake has been done in the teaching and manipulating messages that are far from the gospel. They ask for money in a way the Bible doesn't allow and they have been inspired by false pastors. What we are doing is helping and launching pastors into the Ministry who have no grounding and trainings,  he added.He emphasized natural gifting is no substitution for training therefore, all pastors need theological training.""When you look at the disciples, they were fisher men but they spent three years with Jesus learning and observing, that's why they became experts,"" he said.He said the African study Bible will be distributed across the country to struggling pastors.He said the marathon was also to create awareness as they organise trainings for pastors in rural areas as well.""The trainings include theological teachings, preaching, leadership, discipleship and entrepreneurship, among thers,  he added.Manley Klassen, a guest from US California said the marathon was a good initiative done to support struggling pastors and those without training.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Uganda-Pentecostal-pastors-urged-go-theological-training/688334-5122434-jjs608/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post27.png
24,Parents narrate hustle of caring  for children with hydrocephalus - Daily Monitor,"About two years ago, Ms Teddy Najjuuko, a resident of Namere Village in Wakiso District, gave birth to her first born, Jonathan Mayende, who was normal. Months later, doctors diagnosed him with hydrocephalus, a condition that makes the head grow oversize due to low absorption rates of water in the body. He used to sleep for many hours and I would have to force him to breastfeed. The normal head eventually started growing bigger,  Ms Najjuuko says. Doctors at Cure Hospital dragonised him with the condition but I had never heard of it. I did not know its signs and symptoms,  Ms Najjuuko adds.She says her husband abandoned them upon realising that the child had been diagnosed with the condition.  I could not stay with my husband s parents because they thought it was my fault. I went back to my parents  home where I live up to now. As if it is not traumatising enough, even most members of society have rejected my child. They call him names,  she says.Doctors say about 60 per cent of hydrocephalus cases in Africa are due to infections [germs], others are caused as a result of head injuries and tumors, among others, yet sometimes hydrocephalus develops while the child is still in the uterus (mother s womb). The cause is unknownDr Agatha Namutosi Wakama, a medical worker at Cure Children s Hospital, says the fluids accumulate in the ventricles (chambers), compressing the brain thus damaging it.A research conducted by Cure Hospital and conservative prevalence rates from National Institute of Health indicate that between 3,600 and 5,400 children in Uganda are born with or develop the condition every year.Dr Wakama says:  Victims of hydrocephalus have increasing head size, poor feeding habits with failure to gain weight, suffer constant vomiting, severe headache in children and adults and irritability. When Sunday Monitor met the sick child, we could observe that the child was heavy in weight and could not talk, save for the communications using his eyes. I can know when he wants food and when he is in pain. For instance, when you ask him whether he is hungry, he will close his eyes in affirmative and opens them to negate,  she says.Ms Najjuuko is not the only mother struggling to raise a child with hydrocephalus. Ms Harriet Namusoke, a mother with a child suffering from the same condition, says she had to quit her job to take care of her child. Other parents think that if their children play with ours or even when they touch them, they will contract the condition, which is not the case. There is a lot of stigma that comes from the community. Some think it is some sort of a curse. They have no idea that we are dealing with  expensive  children,  Ms Namusoke said.InterventionMs Ruth Nalujja, the executive director of Spinabifida and Hydrocephalus Awareness Network - Uganda, an association of parents with children with hydrocephalus and spinabifida, says parents and society should understand that the disease is not a curse and it can be treated. They too have a right to privacy and should be respected,  Ms Nalujja says.She advises that taking folic acid before giving birth prevents the risk by 70 per cent.Dr Wakama says expectant women should give birth in the hospital not at home or small village clinics, and that they should avoid use of old razor blades to cut umbilical cord as it is a source of infections [germs]. Do not put anything such as cow dung and lizard dung on the umbilical stump in an attempt to accelerate healing. Keep the baby in clean condition and wash your hands with soap before feeding/holding a new born baby [neonate] in an attempt to prevent infections. In case of a fever and or convulsions, seek immediate help from the hospital. Timely referral of the sick newborn,  she said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Parents-narrate-hustle-caring-children-oversize-heads/688334-5121102-6jq4tfz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post28.png
25,Why masculine sexual privilege persists in Uganda - Daily Monitor,"At 20, Christine officially married a man with a good job as a medical assistant. Over the next decade, they had five children together. But then her husband fell sick and died of HIV/Aids. From that point forward, she knew she too was infected, and because she was monogamous while her husband had two other long-term relationships during their marriage, she felt he was to blame. But Christine was not embittered. She told Robert Wyrod   At that time, people were not fearing HIV/Aids so much. They were not well informed.  In the course of the next decade, both her co-wives also died of HIV/Aids. But Christine never remarried after her husband s death. As I listened to Christine s story, I came to appreciate the devastating toll HIV/Aids had taken on her family. In addition to her husband and co-wives, she had lost a brother to the disease. She then started sharing her house with her younger sister, Mary, who was in the advanced stages of HIV/Aids too,  Wyrod writes in his new ethnography titled Aids and Masculinity in the African City. Like Christine, Mary believed her husband had infected her with HIV/Aids. Over the next six months, I watched as Mary slowly succumbed to the disease, even after gaining access to antiretroviral drugs. Christine was devastated by her death. The disturbing images of Mary s frail body on their couch remain with me still, tempered only by memories of her courage and dry wit in the face of her suffering,  Wyrod adds.Combating AidsThe first book to examine how the Aids epidemic has changed masculinity in Africa is based on Wyrod s decade (2004-2015) of ethnographic research, fieldwork and interviews in the densely populated Bwaise slum community in the capital, Kampala. This book reveals the persistence of masculine privilege in the age of Aids and the implications such privilege has for combating Aids across the African continent.Aids has been a devastating plague in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, yet the long-term implications for gender and sexuality are just emerging. This book tackles this issue head-on and examines how Aids has altered the ways masculinity is lived in Uganda. Christine, a 44-year-old widow has lived in Bwaise for more than two decades. Christine is treasurer of a Post-Test Club, and she has passionately channeled her own experience living with HIV into educating and counselling residents of Bwaise about Aids. Christine survives by making and selling maandazi (sweet fried bread)   an effort that yields about $1 (Shs3,700) in profit per day. Wyrod says this glimpse into Christine s life encapsulates what motivated him to write about how Aids has shaped gender and sexuality in Uganda.  Christine s story reveals the ubiquity of Aids in a place like Bwaise and shows how the disease has become a pervasive aspect of everyday life. From my visits with Christine, it was obvious that Aids had not only ravaged her family but her community as well,  Wyrod says.  Christine s story is also emblematic of the many Ugandans who take action to address the disease, whether by being part of an Aids support group, or helping those afflicted with the disease, or simply by discussing Aids in a frank and open manner,  he adds.According to Wyrod, most centrally for this book, Christine s life also illustrates the role that gender relations have played in the epidemic. Both she and Mary claimed to be monogamous wives and believed they were infected with HIV by their husbands. The book reveals some challenges to, but the ultimate persistence of, men s sexual privileges in the age of Aids   a finding that provides an important corrective to the conventional portrayal of Uganda as Africa s great Aids success story. Men s multiple sexual partnerships have roots in pre-colonial Uganda and remains in practice today across the country. For example, the Baganda have a saying  Omusajja okusajjalaata  or  Omusajja alina okusajjalaata  (meaning that a man has to show his manhood, and should have those multiple partners). According to Wyrod, to some men to prove they are men is having many women as sexual partners.  However, they admit that Aids has complicated such already complex relationship dynamics, and they stress it was something they worried about a great deal,  he says. Attentive. Mr Robert Wyrod (right) and other participants during the discussion of the book. COURTESY PHOTOAccording to a Uganda Aids Commission (UAC) March 2014 report titled  District HIV/Aids Support Supervision and Follow up of HIV/Aids Activities Implemented in Local Governments,  the reported epidemic drivers included alcoholism, multiple sexual partnerships, commercial sex work and low condom use, among others. According to the 2011 Uganda Aids Indicator Survey, three per cent of Ugandan women age 15-49 reported having two or more sexual partners in the past 12 months. Multiple sexual partnerships ranges from a low of one per cent of women in the South Western and West Nile regions to a high of five per cent in East Central region and Kampala.The proportion of men aged 15-49, who had two or more sexual partners in the past 12 months, is more than six times higher than the proportion of women (19 per cent versus three per cent). Among men, multiple sexual partnerships are most common in the East Central (31 per cent) and Mid-Western (25 per cent) regions.  While many conventional approaches to HIV prevention in Uganda continue to focus on promoting monogamy and  being faithful , in my view the number of sexual partners a man or women has is not the key issue. I make the case, instead, that a serious engagement with the persistence of men s privileges to dictate the terms of sex and the freedom to choose, on their own, to establish multiple sexual partnerships is crucial to efforts to address Aids in Uganda, as well as the many other African countries affected by HIV,  Wyrod observes.In the urban Ugandan context, Wyrod uses the term masculine sexual privilege to refer to both men s authority to dictate the terms of sex and a man s right to multiple sexual partners if he so chooses, whether they are wives, girlfriends, or shorter-term partners. Economic insecurity and gender-based violence combine to impede women s ability to negotiate safe sex.According to Wyrod, relationship pressures over money and family intensify to the point that the man, and occasionally the woman, began exploring other relationships.  There was much starting, stopping, and overlap in relationships in Bwaise, all exacerbated by poverty and the persistence of masculine sexual privilege,  he says. Gender tensionsMen s identity as family providers was such a poignant topic for Wyrod s informants. What this book reveals is that gender tensions were also deeply intertwined with sexuality, including the ways some men sought to shore up an embattled masculinity through their intimate relationships. Wyrod notes that women s increasing access to education allows some women to not only provide supplementary income, but actually compete with men as primary providers, which raises questions of authority in the household. Novel ideas of women s rights and gender equity have also gained legitimacy and frame contemporary tensions and negotiations in new ways. The majority of men Wyrod interacted with in his fieldwork were receptive to expanded women s rights, so long as these did not undermine their authority within the home. For such men, women s rights should be limited in scope and not synonymous with equality between men and women.Women marrying men, building house, owning businesses and land today are changing gender relations in Uganda. Women have acquired associated resources and are challenging their husband s authority. Wyrod notes that men are acknowledging the shifting gender relations and are still grappling with how these changes are affecting the meaning of manhood in Uganda. Most men are against testing for HIV with their wives which leaves the latter with few options to negotiate greater sexual safety in their relationships with their husbands. According to Wyrod, women expressed frustration about having limited ability to influence their husband s sexual behaviour. They also expressed a great deal of frustration about how their male partners dealt with the disease, especially the denial of HIV infection. Although some women have chosen monogamy as their primary protection strategy, they are well aware of the limitations of this approach. For example, if there are two wives in a polygamous marriage, one wife will never know what her co-wife is doing to protect herself from HIV infection through extra relationships, or the husband sticking to his two wives. Wyrod observes that although some women are concerned about men s sexuality, they are nonetheless willing to accommodate their husband s desires to have more than one sexual partner, so long as they remained attentive to them and their children. A common trend that Wyrod observed among HIV positive men in Bwaise was their struggle with disclosing their HIV status to their wives for fear that the wives could leave them and they would die alone.Book cover. Mr Robert Wyrod s book.Multiple partnersWyrod observes that the right to have multiple sexual partners was a reservoir of privilege that men could draw on when their relationships became stressed, often due to financial problems.  This was especially common when a couple s children entered school and the financial responsibilities for men increased. It is important to underscore that these types of concurrent, overlapping, long-term relationships are now recognised as especially effective ways of transmitting HIV,  he says. In 15 months of fieldwork in Bwaise, Wyrod rarely encountered women with sexual lives as complicated as those of many men.   Yet my fieldwork also made evident the social and health risks women with multiple partners faced, making me believe women s claims to monogamy were not dramatically exaggerated. The handful of women who told me they were sleeping with more than one man nearly always asserted they did it out of economic necessity. Both women and men frequently told me that money was the main reason women sought out additional sexual partners,  he notes.  The Aids epidemic has made men s control over the terms of sex and men s privilege of having multiple sexual partners more convoluted and contentious. Yet while Aids has complicated aspects of masculine sexual privilege, it has not truly challenged it ,  Wyrod observes, adding:  Given Uganda s success in fighting Aids   a success believed to be predicated in part on men reducing their sexual partnerships   the persistence of male masculine sexual privilege is unexpected at first glance   About the bookAids and Masculinity in the African City was released by University of California Press in July 2016. The 312-page book that is divided into six chapters was launched in Kampala in July 2017.The book is going for $30 on Amazon.

26,Makerere University staff accuse council of betrayal - Daily Monitor,"Makerere University academic, administrative and support staff in an emotive meeting on Friday accused the university s Appointments Board of using information provided by a former chairperson of the Makerere University Council to  victimise  his subordinate.Prof Anthony Mugagga, the deputy principal of College of Education, said Mr Charles Wana-Etyem, the former Makerere University Council chairperson, testified against Dr Deus Muhwezi, the chairperson of Makerere University Academic Staff Association (Muasa), before the Appointments Board using information he had entrusted him with as a leader. It is on the basis of this information, Prof Mugagga said, that the Appointments Board based to suspend Dr Kamunyu from the university service for six months. He said this set a bad precedent that has left those in leadership exposed. I am privy to a lot of information from staff and students. Kindly assure them that what former Council chair did with information he was given as chair will never happen again,  Prof Mugagga shouted out to Mr Daniel Kidega, a member of Council, who attended the associations  meeting to review the decision of the Appointments Board.Dr Robert Kakuru from the College of Humanities said the decision left the staff divided. You found us with a small puncture in Dr Deus Muhwezi as an association leader. You requested to take it and repair the puncture. You brought it back without two wheels. How do you expect the associations to react   he asked.Mr Kidega asked the staff to be patient and explore all the avenues available, saying that the University Council would not accept decisions that are against the Constitution.Some of the staff members in the meeting wanted a resolution made to declare a strike until Dr Kamunyu is reinstated. At the start of this semester, the staff went on strike when the Vice Chancellor, Prof Barnabas Nawangwe, suspended Dr Kamunyu and other leaders of staff associations in a way that the staff said was improper. The strike was suspended after it was agreed that the Appointments Board would investigate the matter. The members of staff are now aggrieved with its decision despite it clearing other leaders and Dr Kamunyu on some charges except on the charge of alleging corruption on the part of some top leaders of the university.It emerged during the meeting on Friday that the testimony on which the board based to convict Dr Kamunyu was provided by Dr Etyem, who reportedly got the information from Dr Kamunyu when the former confided in him as chairman of Council. Mr Kidega moved to calm the flaring tempers. He said:  There is the Whistleblowers Act. It is very unfortunate that a senior citizen can testify against staff with information he had been given. I have a lot of respect for Engineer Etyem. You don t speak about your staff even when you are a senior citizen and have capacity to respond. It is being unethical. We adhere to the Constitution of Uganda and make sure this university is governed under it. The protection of the Whistleblowers Act is in place. We shall utilise it in this university. The staff later agreed to suspend their industrial action for an extra two months to allow the tribunal to hear Dr Muhwezi s appeal, which he said he will submit on Monday. The meeting, which was chaired by Dr Edward Mwavu, Dr Kamunyu s deputy, also appealed that all affected staff whose cases are before the tribunal that will be chaired by Justice Patrick Tabaaro be concluded expeditiously.The members agreed to contribute Shs50m towards Dr Muhwezi s legal fees and make a contribution to supplement his half pay the appointments committee subjected him to as he serves six months on suspension without accessing the university premises as a lecturer. The university accused Dr Kamunyu in January of taking part in an illegal strike, using abusive language, acts or omissions that are prejudicial to the proper performance of duties or the university s image, non-adherence to any other university policies and slander. A committee was instituted to investigate the accusations and has since convicted Muhwezi on one count out of the five. During the probe, the university presented four witnesses, including Prof William Bazeyo, the deputy vice chancellor in charge of Finance, the former university Council chairperson Dr Etyem, Dr Robert Wamala and Mr Gordon Mulangira, Prof Barnabas Nawangwe s personal assistant.However, the committee chaired by Masaka District Chairman Jude Mbabaali said prosecution had failed to prove that Dr Muhwezi had committed the offences except on non-adherence to any other university policies in which Dr Etyem accused him of giving him information without proof against the former Appointment s Board chairperson, Mr Bruce Balaaba, and the Finance committee chair, Mr Thomas Tayebwa.  It is clear from the un-rebutted prosecution evidence that the respondent neglected and failed to adhere to the university s general code of conduct. Additionally, that he neglected and wilfully refused to comply with guidance and directives issued to him as a member of staff,  reads the May 13 ruling.It adds:  Evidence adduced shows that respondent was warned by the vice chancellor in writing to desist from attacks on unsubstantiated allegations but he refused and neglected to comply with the directives. It is our opinion that all this conduct was in bad faith and unbecoming. This charge has been proved and therefore find the respondent guilty of this count as charged. The board in its wisdom has decided to use its discretion as provided in the university human resource manual; that instead of dismissal to sentence the respondent to six months suspension with immediate effect. Other committee members were: Mr Kiryowa Kiwanuka, Chris Ninsiima, Ms Jolly Uzamukunda Karabaaya and Mr Winston Tumps Ireeta.Dr Etyem testified that he met the respondent while he was still council chairperson alleging that Mr Kabaasa was receiving bribes to award jobs but when he asked him for evidence, he couldn t provide it and that Mr Tayebwa who was chairing the appointment s board finance and investment committee was over stepping his mandate. AccusationsDr Etyem s other accusation is that Dr Muhwezi complained about the Makerere University manual which had been changed without consulting the association. He testified that he warned Dr Muhwezi to stop making those allegations without proof which he disregarded.  After the meeting, he came to a conclusion that all those complaints raised by the respondent were mere allegations without proof because when he asked him for proof so that as chair of council he can handle the complaints, he didn t provide them,  the report adds.Dr Muhammad Kiggundu, the director of communications, said management was open to any negotiations to end the impasse.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Makerere-University-staff-accuse-council-betrayal/688334-5121090-15gfnb4/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post30.png
27,Government investment in private hospitals not helping poor - Daily Monitor,"Whereas the government has set out to use public-private partnerships (PPPs) to ensure universal health coverage, research has revealed that the deal never translated into increased access or equitable treatment for the poor.This is one of the findings of a research that was carried out by Initiative for Social and Economic Rights (ISER), an NGO, to establish whether health, finance and development policies are translating into the provision of services that guarantee the rights of Uganda s vulnerable populations.The report titled,  Achieving Equity in Health: Are Public-Private Partnerships the Solution  , concludes that investing in public healthcare where most of the poor go for treatment would make more sense than investing in an arguably risky private project.The report was released a month after Parliament approved a proposal to issue promissory notes to the tune of Shs1.3 trillion to Finasi/Roko Construction Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Ltd to finance the construction of the proposed International Specialised Hospital of Uganda at Lubowa, in Wakiso District. There is no evidence that strengthening the private sector results in better health outcomes for the poor and rural communities. If anything, evidence has shown that private for profit is unlikely to deliver better health outcomes for the poor people and exacerbates inequalities, resulting in the rich being able to access better healthcare and the poor excluded,  the report reads in part.The report also pokes holes in the arguments that private sector-led health facilities are more efficient than public health facilities. The research also indicts the regulatory framework for PPPs, describing them as  weak and piecemeal . Laws such as the PPP Act, 2015, PPP Policy Framework 2010 and the National Public Private Partnership in Health Policy 2012, the document says, create overlapping and contradictory obligations.According to the report, no specific methodology that would ensure economic analysis, fiscal affordability, risk identification and transfer, value for money, assessment for human rights compliance were followed during the formulation of the laws.Government s funding to the health sector over the last several years, the report says, has oscillated between 7 and 9 per cent of the National Budget, standing at 7.4 per cent this financial year and 6.4 per cent the previous year, all of which is way below the 15 per cent that African Union countries committed to in the Abuja Declaration.The report indicts government for failure to fulfill its promise to improve healthcare for the poor and geographically isolated. Instead, it relies on mostly foreign donor and religious PNFPs [Private Not For Profit organisations] to provide essential services. Sometimes, the government provides significant funding to PNFPs to service an area in lieu of establishing public facilities,  it says.RecommendationsISER calls on government to increase the budgetary allocation to the health sector and work with Parliament to improve the PPP laws. Government, the reports says, should cease looking at the private sector as its substitute. Public private partnerships cannot compensate for a weak State and require the State to maintain a strong and consistent stewardship role,  it says.The document also called on MPs to refrain from approving PPPs without following legally defined procedure, allocate more funds to the health sector and pass a national insurance scheme to allow for equitable access to health care. ISER also called on donors to invest in the public health sector.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-investment-private-hospitals-not-helping-poor/688334-5121032-jeo36r/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post31.png
28,Contractor risks being thrown out over slow works on Masaka market - Daily Monitor,"Masaka. Multiplex Ltd and Alshams Construction Company Ltd, the firms constructing Masaka Central Market, risk losing the contract over delayed works.Work on the market, which started in February last year, was expected to be completed by July 30 next year, but so far only 33 per cent of work is complete. Mr Geoffrey Ettedu, the Masaka project coordinator for Market and Agricultural Trade Improvement Project (MATIP-2) under the Ministry of Local Government, said the slow pace of construction may force them to cancel the contract if the contractor does not complete at least 65 per cent of the work in the next two months. When a government delegation visited the site in February, the contractor had promised to complete the first floor by March. However, a visit to the site on Thursday revealed this has not been the case.Mr Ettedu said contractors working on the same market projects in other municipalities such as Mbarara and Kitgum, have already completed at least 50 per cent of the work.  The most disappointing thing is that the Masaka market project was among the first projects to start, but we are behind schedule. So, we are strongly considering terminating the contract or taking legal action,  Mr Ettedu said during a visit to the site on Thursday. The market project is funded by the African Development Bank and Ugandan government at a tune of Shs18.4b. Mr Moses Ndege Bbosa, the managing director of Multiplex Ltd, said a number of challenges, including inadequate manpower and bad weather are holding them back.He, however, said in order to complete work in time, they have decided to work in shifts, with some employees working during day and others during the night.Masaka Municipality Mayor Godfrey Kayemba said they are ready to offer all the necessary support to the contractor to enable them complete the work in the stipulated time frame.Ms Elizabeth Nakayiza, the chairperson of the Masaka Central Market Vendors Association, urged the contractor to speed up work on the project, saying the place where vendors were temporarily relocated is in a poor condition and their merchandise always get soaked in dirty water whenever it rains.The old Masaka Central Market structure, which was constructed in 1936, was pulled down early last year to pave way for the new market. It used to house more than 1,000 vendors.The new market, once complete, is expected to accommodate more than 2,000 vendors. It will also have an agro-processing facility, stalls, shops, cold rooms, restaurants, a parking yard and loading and offloading areas, drainage ways, solid waste bays, firefighting facilities, among others.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Contractor-risks-being-thrown-out-slow-works-Masaka-market/688334-5121014-hsbau4z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post32.png
29,Residents petition minister over shoddy roadworks - Daily Monitor,"LYANTONDE.  Residents of three villages in Kyewanula Parish, Lyantonde Sub-county in Lyantonde District, have petitioned the State minister for Works, Gen Katumba Wamala, to prevail over a contractor who they accuse of doing shoddy work.In a petition dated May 7, signed by Mr Abdul Nyanzi, the Kamengo Village chairperson, they state that although roadworks on the 9.5km Kempega-Kiwootoozi-Buyanja road were completed early this month, gapping potholes have started to emerge.The project was awarded to Bresum Enterprises Ltd at a cost of Shs325m.The residents also claim the contractor used poor quality murrum and culverts and whenever it rains, water floods their houses.The road passes through the villages of Kiwootoozi, Mpumudde, Kamengo, Kempega, Kasese, Kabayanda, Kyewanula and Buyanja. Our houses get flooded whenever it rains because the culverts used do not allow easy water flow. In some sections of the road, water remain stagnant in the middle of the road,  Mr Nyanzi said in an interview with this newspaper on Thursday.No value for moneyMr Fred Muhangi, the Lyantonde District chairperson, told this newspaper that construction works were poorly done yet a lot of money was injected into the project. As a district, we had allocated Shs40 million to work on the same road and our work would even be better than what they did, but the Ministry of Works decided to source a contractor to do the work,  he said.But Mr James Kakooza, the Kabula County MP, while appearing on a local radio station last weekend, asked residents to accept what has been done by the contractor, saying  no one knows where the money for road was got from. When contacted on the matter, Ms Susan Kataike, the Ministry of Works and Transport spokesperson, said she could not authoritatively comment on the matter, asking for more time to consult her superiors.But Gen Wamala said when the ministry allocates funds for roadworks in districts, it is the local leadership to supervise and raise the red flag in case of shoddy work. Where were they [district] as the direct beneficiaries when the contractor was doing shoddy work  I will charge the local leaders on ground who failed to carry out supervision,  he said by telephone on Thursday.Ms Rhodah Tiitwe Kagaaga, the Lyantonde deputy Resident District Commissioner, said since the contract funds are wired to the district bank account, she was going to ask the chief administrative officer (CAO) to halt any payments to the contractor.

30,Ukraine to inaugurate comedian Zelensky as president - Daily Monitor,"Comedian Volodymyr Zelensky steps into his new role as Ukrainian president with his inauguration on Monday, launching a new era for the country wracked by war and economic difficulties.A month after scoring a landslide victory against incumbent Petro Poroshenko in polls, the 41-year-old becomes Ukraine's youngest post-Soviet president. He will swear an oath in a ceremony starting at 0700 GMT. According to tradition, he will place his hand on a copy of the constitution and possibly also a Bible.He will then give an address to the nation that will be closely watched for clues on his future course.So far little is known about his precise policies after a campaign that capitalised on public disillusionment with the political establishment and promised to ""break the system"".Uniquely for a first-time president, Zelensky has played the scene before -- for laughs. He starred as a history teacher who was unexpectedly elected president in the comedy series ""Servant of the People"".Just a few months ago, the idea that Zelensky would be inaugurated for real seemed equally unlikely. When the actor and comedian announced his candidacy on December 31, few took it seriously, but after an unprecedented campaign largely waged through social media, he won more than 73 percent in the second round on April 21, trouncing Poroshenko.Poroshenko led Ukraine for five years, overseeing the fallout over Russia's annexation of Crimea and armed conflict with Moscow-backed separatists in the country's East that has caused some 13,000 deaths.Poroshenko averted complete collapse and launched a series of key reforms but was widely criticised for failing to improve Ukrainians' living standards or effectively fight all-pervasive corruption.Country needs changesZelensky has vowed to continue the country's pro-Western course but beyond that his programme is still sketchy and his team largely unknown. His critics question how he will deal with the enormous challenges of the separatist conflict and ongoing economic problems.The leader of one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in Ukraine's industrial Donbass region, Denis Pushilin, on Friday told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that he was ""ready for dialogue"" with the new authorities in Kiev, ""naturally taking into account the interests of Donbass"".Nevertheless he condemned what he called ""destructive"" statements by Zelensky's team and accused Kiev of ""blocking the peace process"" which has long stalled.Also under question is whether Zelensky will be able to govern without a parliamentary majority. Even setting a date for his inauguration took weeks of negotiations, with Zelensky exasperatedly calling lawmakers ""petty crooks"".Zelensky has threatened to dissolve the parliament and hold snap elections before the set date in October to benefit from his current popularity. But lawmakers are determined to thwart his efforts in launching the complex process.""The country needs changes and fundamental reforms,"" the president-elect's team said in a statement on Friday. ""This is the demand of the Ukrainian people. And for that, we need a parliament that functions.""Ukraine's allies have given Zelensky a warm welcome, but one Ukrainian site specialising in international affairs, Evropeyska Pravda, suggested this was a ""hug strategy"" to ensure he continued to pursue a rapprochement with the West.The new president will immediately have to deal with a number of sensitive international issues, giving him a foretaste of the challenges lying ahead.Three days after Zelensky's election, the Kremlin announced it was easing procedures for those living in the eastern separatist regions to gain Russian citizenship. Many observers in Kiev saw this as Moscow issuing a challenge to Zelensky and he strongly condemned the move.In a sign of possible tensions between Kiev and Washington, Ukraine's key ally against Moscow, US President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani this month cancelled a visit to Kiev, saying Zelensky is ""surrounded by people who are enemies of the (US) president.""The febrile political situation prompted one pro-Western lawmaker, Serguiy Vysotsky, to warn Zelensky that the inauguration ""isn't the end of your adventures -- it's just the beginning"".",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Ukraine-comedian-Zelensky-president-Russia-Crimea/688340-5122770-13guir4z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post34.png
31,"Trump: if Tehran attacks, it will be 'official end of Iran' - Daily Monitor","President Donald Trump issued an ominous warning to Iran on Sunday, suggesting that if the Islamic republic attacks American interests, it will be destroyed.""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again,"" Trump said in a tweet.Tensions between Washington and Tehran have been on the rise as the United States has deployed a carrier group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf over what it termed Iranian ""threats."" This account has been met with widespread skepticism outside the United States.The White House has sent mixed signals in recent days, amid multiple US media reports of infighting in Trump's cabinet over how hard to push Washington's arch foe Iran.The Trump administration has ordered non-essential diplomatic staff out of Iraq, citing threats from Iranian-backed Iraqi armed groups, and sent an aircraft carrier and heavy B-52 bombers to the region.On Sunday, a Katyusha rocket was fired into Baghdad's Green Zone housing government offices and embassies including the US mission. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack.According to US media reports, Trump's long-hawkish national security advisor John Bolton is pushing a hard line on Iran, but others in the administration are resisting.Trump himself said recently that he has to ""temper"" Bolton.Iran's foreign minister downplayed the prospect of a new war in the region on Saturday, saying Tehran opposed it and no party was under the ""illusion"" the Islamic republic could be confronted.""We are certain... there will not be a war since neither we want a war nor does anyone have the illusion they can confront Iran in the region,"" Mohammad Javad Zarif told state-run news agency IRNA at the end of a visit to China.Iran-US relations hit a new low last year as US Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed unilateral sanctions that had been lifted in exchange for Tehran scaling back its nuclear program.Saudi Arabia called Sunday for emergency regional talks to discuss the mounting Gulf tensions, saying that it does not want war with Iran but is ready to defend itself.It comes days after mysterious sabotage attacks on several tankers in highly sensitive Gulf waters and drone strikes on a Saudi crude pipeline by Yemen rebels who Riyadh claimed were acting on Iranian orders.King Salman invited Gulf leaders and Arab League member states to two emergency summits in Mecca on May 30 to discuss recent ""aggressions and their consequences"", the kingdom's official SPA news agency reported late Saturday.Saudi Arabia's minister of state for foreign affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, said Sunday his country does not want to go to war with Iran but would defend itself.Saudi Arabia ""does not want a war, is not looking for it and will do everything to prevent it,"" he said.""But at the same time, if the other side chooses war, the kingdom will respond with strength and determination to defend itself and its interests.""The kingdom's regional allies welcomed the Saudi invitation. The United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry said the current ""critical circumstances"" require a unified Arab and Gulf stance.Oil producing countries met Sunday in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to stabilise a volatile oil market amid the rising US-Iran tensions, which threaten to disrupt global supply.Oil supplies are sufficient and stockpiles still rising despite massive output drops from Iran and Venezuela, said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said at the meeting in Jeddah.Childish regimesQatar Sunday weighed in on the escalating tensions, saying it did not believe the US or Iran wanted a war in the region. ""US President Donald Trump has said he does not want war, and I do not think Iran wants war or instability in the region,"" minister of state for foreign affairs Sultan al-Muraikhi told AFP on the sidelines of a Qatar Fund for Development briefing.""I think if we move away from the childish regimes in the region, all troubles will be settled.""Muraikhi said Doha -- which remains isolated by neighboring former allies in a long-running diplomatic dispute -- has not yet received a formal invitation to either meeting. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt are among the countries that cut ties with Qatar in June 2017 over accusations it supports terrorism and seeks closer ties with Tehran. Four ships including two Saudi oil tankers were damaged in mysterious sabotage attacks last Sunday off the UAE's Fujairah, near the Strait of Hormuz -- a vital maritime route for oil exports which Iran has threatened to close in the event of a war.That incident was followed by drone strikes Tuesday claimed by Yemen's Iran-aligned rebels on a major Saudi oil pipeline built as an alternative export route if the Strait of Hormuz were to be closed.Saudi Arabia accused Tehran of ordering the pipeline attacks, targeting ""the security of oil supplies... and the global economy"".

32,Saudi Arabia deposits $250 million in Sudan's central bank - Daily Monitor,"Saudi Arabia announced Sunday it deposited $250 million in Sudan's central bank as part of a support package for the country following the overthrow of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.""The ministry of finance has deposited 937.5 million Saudi riyals into the central bank of Sudan,"" it said in a statement. In April, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced three billion dollars (2.7 billion euros) in financial aid for Sudan. ""$500 million has been provided by both countries... to strengthen its financial position,"" the kingdom's finance ministry said. The UAE said on April 28 it was depositing $250 million in Sudan's central bank.The oil-rich Gulf states pledged to inject $500 million into Sudan's central bank and $2.5 billion to help provide food, medicine and petroleum products, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said last month.It said the move was aimed shoring up the Sudanese pound.In recent years Sudan has been hit by an acute lack of dollars, a key factor behind the nationwide protests that first erupted in December and led to the toppling of Bashir by the army last month.Sudan plays a key role in the regional interests of Saudi Arabia and its allies, siding with Riyadh against Shiite Iran and providing troops in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen's war.Both Gulf nations have voiced backing for Sudan's military rulers, who are facing calls from protesters to cede power to a civilian transitional government.The Sudanese currency had plunged even after the United States lifted its 20-year-old trade embargo on the country in October 2017.Expectations that the end of US sanctions would bring an economic recovery failed to materialise, putting pressure on the pound.The country's economic crisis has deepened since the secession of South Sudan in 2011 that took away the bulk of oil earnings.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Saudi-Arabia-deposits--250-million-Sudan-s-central-bank/688340-5122366-afgub5z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post36.png
33,Sudan protesters insist on civilian head for new governing body - Daily Monitor,"Sudanese protest leaders said Sunday they will insist a civilian runs a planned new governing body in new talks with army rulers, as Islamists warn against excluding sharia from the political roadmap.The Alliance for Freedom and Change is determined that the country's new ruling body be ""led by a civilian as its chairman and with a limited military representation"", it said in a statement.The protesters' umbrella group said talks would resume with the military council -- which has ruled Sudan since president Omar al-Bashir was deposed on April 11 -- at 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) on Sunday.Talks over a transfer of power by the generals have repeatedly stalled, resulting in international pressure to return to the table after the generals suspended negotiations earlier this week.The generals insist the new body be military-led but the protest leaders demand a majority civilian body.On Sunday the protest movement raised the ante by insisting that the ruling body should be headed by a civilian.The military council is headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the generals have previously said he would lead the new governing body.Before talks were suspended the two sides had agreed on several key issues, including a three-year transition period and the creation of a 300-member parliament, with two thirds of lawmakers to come from the protesters' umbrella group.The previous round of talks was marred by violence after five protesters and an army major were shot dead near the ongoing sit-in outside the military headquarters in central Khartoum, where thousands have camped out for weeks.Initially, the protesters gathered to demand Bashir resign -- but they have stayed put, to pressure the generals into stepping aside.The protesters had also erected roadblocks on some avenues in Khartoum, paralysing large parts of the capital, to put further pressure on the generals during negotiations, but the miliary rulers suspended the last round of talks and demanded the barriers be removed.Protesters duly took the roadblocks down in recent days -- but they warn they will put them back up, if the army fails to transfer power to a civilian administration.The generals have allowed protesters to maintain their sit-in outside Khartoum's army headquarters.Islamists' warning Islamic movements rallied outside the presidential palace on Saturday night, to reject any civilian administration that excludes sharia as its guiding principle.Hundreds took part in the rally, the first organised mobilisation by Islamist groups since Bashir's ouster.""The main reason for the mobilisation is that the alliance (the main protesters' umbrella group) is ignoring the application of sharia in its deal,"" said Al-Tayieb Mustafa, who heads a coalition of about 20 Islamic groups.""This is irresponsible and if that deal is done, it is going to open the door of hell for Sudan,"" he told AFP.Bashir came to power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989 and Sudanese legislation has since been underpinned by Islamic law.At Saturday's rally, hardline cleric Mohamed Ali Jazuli had a warning for the military council. ""If you consider handing over power to a certain faction, then we will consider it a coup"", he vowed as supporters chanted ""Allahu Akbar"".The protest leaders have so far remained silent on whether sharia has a place in Sudan's future, arguing that their main concern is installing a civilian administration.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Sudan-protesters-civilian-body-Fattah-al-Burhan/688340-5122270-ytptqiz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post37.png

35,Australia election stokes mistrust in opinion polls - Daily Monitor,"The failure of opinion polls to tip a conservative win in Australia's elections has raised questions about their credibility just years after similar errors in forecasting Brexit and Donald Trump's victory in the US.Australia's ruling Liberal-National coalition claimed a shock victory in Saturday's election, after two years of trailing the opposition Labor Party in every major national poll.The polls showed a slight tightening between the two main parties with Labor ahead roughly 51-49 just before the election.The tentative result, pending final results from the Australian Electoral Commission, shows the coalition instead ahead 51-49 on Monday.""Why did we have such an amazing sequence of polls in a row that all got the same (results) "" Australian polling analyst Kevin Bonham told AFP of the years of polling that pointed to a Labor victory.Most media routinely rely on polls -- surveys of hundreds, sometimes thousands of voters by phone or online -- to flag political trends and tip the leading candidates.But question marks were raised about their accuracy in 2016 after the failure to forecast Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's triumph in the US presidential election.In Australia, political polling has had a good record, and is so closely followed in Canberra that a string of prime ministers were dumped by their own parties over the past decade over poor showings in surveys.Traditionally, pollsters contacted voters using extensive landline lists, such as the phone book. But with voters ditching landlines, it is become more difficult for pollsters to collect an accurate representative sample of the electorate.Bonham said signs polling was becoming less accurate had emerged at the state level, particularly ahead of regional elections in Victoria state in November which failed to capture a strong swing to the incumbent Labor government.""It's become increasingly harder to actually just find where a telephone number is and therefore design an efficient sample,"" Martin O'Shannessy, the ex-chief of major Australian pollster Newspoll, told AFP.""This is being faced by the whole research industry and what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg.""Pollsters have also turned to cheaper forms of collecting opinions, such as robocalls and online surveys, which experts say are significantly less accurate.O'Shannessy said the key problems that emerged from the polls of the 2016 US elections were similar.""The good quality polls, which did the best job that they could have sampling... and used human operators, generally got the answer right. However they were only 12 percent of all the polls,"" he said.""The other 88 percent were online (polls), robopolls... the average error for those polls was five percent and the biggest error was 10 percent.""One alternative method of sampling voters has been through social media.In Australia, Griffith University data scientist Bela Stantic said he accurately predicted Trump's win, Brexit and the conservatives' win on Saturday by analysing millions of social media comments.He told news.com.au he was successful as he had used large sample sizes -- some two million ""relevant"" tweets from around half a million accounts.O'Shannessy said to make news polls more accurate, Australia's market research sector was lobbying for access to the government's Integrated Public Number Database (IPND), which contains all listed and unlisted telephone numbers and is used by emergency services and law enforcement.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Australia-election-opinion-polls-Brexit-Donald-Trump/688334-5123084-1svn26/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post39.png
36,Google and Android system start to cut ties with Huawei - Daily Monitor,"US internet giant Google, whose Android mobile operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, said Sunday it was beginning to cut ties with China's Huawei, which Washington considers a national security threat.In the midst of a trade war with Beijing, President Donald Trump has barred US companies from engaging in telecommunications trade with foreign companies said to threaten American national security.The measure targets Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant in Washington's sights that is listed by the Commerce Department among firms with which American companies can only engage in trade after obtaining the green light from the authorities.The ban includes technology sharing.""We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,"" a Google spokesperson told AFP.The move could have dramatic implications since Google, like all tech companies, must collaborate with smartphone makers to ensure its systems are compatible with their devices.Google will have to halt business activities with Huawei that involve transfer of hardware, software and technical services that are not publicly available -- meaning Huawei will only be able to use the open source version of Android, a source close to the matter told AFP.Huawei will no longer have access to Google's proprietary apps and services, such as the Gmail email service.Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Huawei is a rapidly expanding leader in 5G technology but remains dependent on foreign suppliers.It buys about $67 billion worth of components each year, including about $11 billion from US suppliers, according to The Nikkei business daily.Huawei is the target of an intense campaign by Washington, which has been trying to persuade allies not to allow China a role in building next-generation 5G mobile networks. US government agencies are already banned from buying equipment from Huawei.Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said Saturday that ""We have not done anything which violates the law,"" adding the US measures would have a limited impact.

37,Ocaya to bring his car dream to life - Daily Monitor,"Born to Silverno Orinyo from Zombo, Matthias Ocaya, 25, is one of the innovators in the vocational field, thanks to his persistence. An old student of Otoroga Boys Primary School in Zombo, Ocaya started dreaming about joining vocational education then, but his father would not hear any of it.  After Primary Seven, I told my father that I wanted to enroll in a vocational institute although he wanted me to continue to secondary school. So, I joined St Aloysius Secondary School in Zombo District and while there, my knowledge on innovation developed,  Ocaya recalls. He got career guidance and learned that he could actually go enroll in a vocational school after O-Level.  Whenever we got holidays, I would go to different people in my village for apprenticeship in plumbing work, building and wiring. I did that from Senior One holidays to Senior Four. In Senior Four vacation, I built myself a house and since I wanted to make a door for it, I went to a certain carpenter in my village to ask him for his equipment,  he says. But the carpenter instead asked him to come and help him at his workshop since he had no one to work with. Ocaya started work the following day.  I made my door but also learnt more skills, so, next, I made myself a bed but before I could take it home, a buyer asked for it. I told him I could make him one and he paid me Shs200,000. This was the first money I earned and through him, I got many more customers,  he narrates. Although Ocaya did carpentry work, being a mechanic was his ultimate dream. After Senior Four vacation, he still expressed interest in vocational education but his father still did not want him to go.  I joined A-Level at Paidha Senior Secondary School but class things had gotten a bit slow for me. I looked for a garage in the area where I would work at the weekend and during the holiday. It was then that I thought about making a prototype of a car from timber,  he says. Realising his dreamWith six points after A-Level, he joined vocational school. Ocaya joined Lugogo Vocational Institute in Kampala in 2016.  Two weeks into the course, I went to my lecturer and told him I wanted to build a car. He asked me how I was going to do it and told me to write a proposal with all the details and to also draw what I wanted to make. He also asked me whether I would be able to pull it off,  Ocaya explains. In first year, when real life projects were introduced and they were asked to make stoves, Ocaya had bigger fish to fry in mind.  In second year when they told us to build something, I just wanted to build a car. I already had my proposal and I told the teacher that I wanted to make a car, but he said that could not work. I went and talked to the head of department, who gave me a go ahead,  he recalls.Financial constraitsOcaya had no money. So during holidays, he went to the village and found work.  I earned Shs150,000 which I used to buy some things such as a motor, magnetar and other things for my prototype.  Ocaya spent two and a half months building the car in addition to building and designing things such as DC stoves, water pumps and a car heater for friends in order to get money for his prototype. After completing his prototype, he took it to the teacher and showed off his dream. The prototype was a solar driven car with an external steering wheel which he could use to control its movements.  But because I had a tuition debt, I went back to the village to look for money. From there, I was called by the principal for a vocational exhibition at Parliament in November 2017. I was also allowed to do my examinations. But when I went back to the village with my Shs400,000 that I had got from people who saw my innovation at the exhibition, I decided to build a big car which I am currently working on but won t give a lot of details about it for now,  Ocaya asserts.  I was also recently invited to an exhibition at UBTEB, where I exhibited my car before the Education minister Janet Museveni. But as I work on my big project, I also work in a garage in my village because I still have a debt at school,  he says. Ocaya needs about Shs95m to build his first big prototype of a solar driven car. Other student innovationsTogether with his robotics team, the International University of East Africa students built a car surveillance system. Andrew Bakashaba said, this is a smart home surveillance system that will have multiple functions. It will be able to; pick up sound, take videos, see what is at a distance, will be able to detect obstacles and able to control the lighting system in a home using a timer. It will also be able to pick feedback, move for example in a compound or house and do all those functions. I specifically did the parking coding that detects obstacles. We have built a control module/app that is connected to a mobile app, so it can connect everywhere, plus the camera module. We are still working on that body to adopt to functions and implement some parts but we want to have a working prototype soon. The surveillance car works as a proof of concept that we can build our own robots without studying a specific course.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Ocaya-car-dream-to-life-carpentry-work-Zombo-District/688336-5112776-rvg9my/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post41.png
38,Want to boost your career  Read - Daily Monitor,"Gives me confidenceMy job is to sell knowledge, history and tell a story the clients have no idea about. This has taught me to read constantly. Everyday I read something in relation to travel. Before taking any person to the site, I visit it first, make research and buy any written literature about it. I read any travel literature I come across naturally. I even read about the different Christian historical sites. I may not necessarily buy a book, but I carry out research and read online. This has opened my mind and widened my knowledge about different cultures. When I am talking to people; I speak with confidence because I am sure about what I am telling them. Mary Josephina Nanyonga, tours and travel dealerMotivated my career choiceMy reading journey started while in primary school. I enjoyed reading fictional stories such as Mr Hare tales because I found them entertaining. While in secondary school I would visit the school library to read novels during my free time. I read a book titled To Be the Best by Barbara Taylor which motivated me to aim higher and opened me up to more of her work such as A woman of Substance, which inspired me to pursue a career in finance. Currently, I read mathematics-related articles and mainly motivational books. My current read is Nice Girls Don t Get the Corner Office which talks about unconscious mistakes women make that sabotage their careers.Ann Kyakuwaire, auditorReading makes me practicalKyamanywa handles civil law cases to do with property, family issues that entail divorce, annulment, child custody. Because of his choice of work, he says his reading is not about to end. To manage handling the different cases I realised I need to have an inquisitive mind, excellent analytical skills and the ability to think.  At times clients expect an immediate answer. With this I came to a conclusion that lawyers need to be good readers. I read books such as Civil rights and Liberties in the 21 century, In Our Defense. The Civil Rights book gives an analysis of the Supreme Court s landmark rulings on civil rights and liberties. Reading has made me resourceful to my clients, taught me new court presentations and has helped me improve on my vocabulary. However, it calls for commitment. Currently, I am reading My Life in Court by Louise Nizer. Edward Cooper Kyamanywa, lawyerBroadened my thinkingMy reading culture started at the age of 10. In those early years I read a lot of adventure books. I would literally feel as if I was on the same adventure journey as the characters in the book. As a teen, I began reading literature from authors such as Jeffrey Archer, Wilbur Smith and Danielle Steele, which helped me understand new concepts about life and my vocabulary. While in high school he was introduced to African authors such as Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and others whose works gave him a new understanding of the continent. Today, I read different genres of literature, popular psychology, faith-based books, biographies, African books on history and economics, leadership and management books, motivational books. Reading has broadened my mind. I am able to know and understand a variety of topics. Currently, I am reading Purple Cow by Seth Godin, which is about avoiding being average. If you want to develop a reading culture, start slowly with one book at a time, those that you will enjoy, as well as joining a book club.Stirling Gapara, leadership and management consultantEnlightened meAmos Wekesa s reading culture did not develop until 2001 when he committed to reading for two hours a day. Reading different literature such as Transformation of Singapore from third world to second world, Problems of Africa, he says his reading kept improving. When reading, I spare 45 minute to read about a topic I am involved in. This has given me leverage over many people who come to me for information. I was influenced into reading by my wife. My wife is a good reader and so are my children. I realised if I did not read I would remain the idiot of the family. Writing has also given me an opportunity to read. The more you write, the more you read.Amos Wekesa, tourism entrepreneurKeeps my brain activeMy father used to read a lot. When I was a child, he would read to me story books written in Rutooro. Slowly, I began to broaden my reading scope. When I joined Nyakasura School, I started a newspaper called The Student. But today, I read medicine-related material, I read about the latest advances, news about medicine and I do a lot of research.  I keep tickling my brain by reading all the necessary literature within my profession and others I find relevant. Vincent Karuhanga, doctorLeaders are readers Leaders are readers. If you want to be a leader then you must be a reader. If you want to excel in any field such as being a politician or fashion designer you have to be a long-life learner and reader.  In life there has to be continuous improvement in all that we do. And the way you can improve is to continuously read.   If the last time you read a book was the time you graduated from university, yet you have been working for the last five years, it means you are stunted. As an educationist, I read constantly. I believe, the more you read, the better you become. Through reading I have been mentored by different people I admire but can never have conversations with. My recent great read has been by Michelle Obama s, Becoming. But currently I am reading The 15 Rules of Growth by John Maxwell. He says growth is intentional, not accidental. To inspire my children to read, each time any of them reads a book I put Shs10,000 in their piggy bank.

39,"Digital libraries, game-changer in rural schools - Daily Monitor","In October last year, Nyombi Thembo, the director Rural Communications Development Fund at the Uganda Communications Commission, announced government would introduce video conferencing lessons aimed at connecting rural schools to their urban counterparts. According to Thembo, the move is aimed at providing rural and urban students the same learning opportunities. We want a situation where a good Mathematics teacher in St Mary s College, Kisubi is giving a lesson, and some 100 rural schools in Karamoja following this lesson,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries. To support the move, National Social Security Fund (NSSF) has injected more than Shs450m to provide tablets to mainly underpriviledged secondary schools so as to compete favourably with priviledged schools.While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation, owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries. To support the move, National Social Security Fund (NSSF), has injected more than Shs450m to provide tablets to mainly underpriviledged secondary schools so as to compete favourably with priviledged schools. While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent, especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.So far, the Fund has donated at least 440 digital learning tablets to 11 schools with each school receiving 40 tablets. The project is expected to benefit more than 3,500 students in Senior Four and Senior Six in the next one year and more than 5,200 students in the next two years. Aggrey Kibenge, the Under Secretary in the Ministry of Education and Sports, says the initiative will help students in underpriviledged schools to rise up to the occasion and compete favourably with their counterparts in priviledged schools.  Students in schools that do not have access to modern learning facilities will get exposure to and access modern learning resources and tools. I look forward to a time when all secondary schools will benefit from this type of digital technology to transform teaching and learning,  he said.Infrastructure issuesSanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher of Mpummudde Seed Secondary School, said he is supportive of the project and hopes it will help in reducing the workload for teachers and expose students to a wide range of learning materials as well as the digital world.However, he expressed worry that due to limited space in some government-aided schools for instance, as a result of the surging numbers in student population, buildings to house digital libraries must be put up.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space for this digital library. My teachers do not have where to sit because the staffroom is now occupied with the tablets,  he lamented. James Asili, the head of department for secondary schools and coordinator of the Digital Library project at NCDC, is optimistic that the tablet will prepare students for a digital curriculum with multiple content. The tablet costs Shs600,000 but Asili is hopeful that the cost will reduce with time. How the tablet works Ivan Mukasa, the software engineer in charge of the digital library project, says the digital tablets have been tailored to the school curriculum inclusive of all subjects for both O and A levels.  The tablet has been fitted with virtual learn software that incorporates the curriculum for both O and A levels. Each subject follows topics as designed in the curriculum. We shall keep modifying it to suit the students  needs,  he reveals.He further explains,  At the end of each topic, a student can do a self-assessment basing on the three levels of assessment. If the student fails the assessment, they are advised to retake and complete it. All the students  work and assessments are stored on the cloud for review by teachers as well as NCDC officials for analysis on how students are progressing in different subjects, for instance by analysing the difficult and easy topics.    It is also designed with an e-book readers  icon which enables students to buy online text books and read on their own. The virtual learn also permits performance tracking by schools and parents that can be accessed on Android mobile phones,  Mukasa adds.The tablet can be used both online and offline. Even better, a solar backpack has been provided in cases of power blackout or shortages.  At first the goal was to develop a virtual lab for sciences but then later we agreed to incorporate both arts and sciences. Students can even tap into the syllabus and read ahead of the teacher and do assessments.  Students react Hendrick Oboth, a Senior Six student, says he is enthusiastic about the digital library and hopes it will improve his learning.  I have realised there are things teachers fail to explain well in class but which you can read and understand on the tablets on your own. Similarly, Doreen Mugala, a Senior Four student, says it will ease her studies and help her get more details through research.  I will also be able to acquire skills in ICT which I may require in future,  she hopefully says.Knowing how many rural school grapple with poorly stocked libraries or nonexistent libraries at all, digital libraries could be the timely intervention to bridge the gap between rural underprivildged schools and priviledged ones.Other edu-tabsKaino Africa, a smart school management tech company last year launched their flagship product, the Kaino Tablet crafted for the Ugandan primary pupil. This Education Technology (EdTech) tablet comes with curriculum aligned teacher guides that show the teacher lesson plans; how they are supposed to proceed with the class, what examples to give as well as time the lesson is supposed to start and end. It comes with well-prepared notes from Ugandan content providers, not to mention, it has offline and online past papers, exams and instant assessments at the end of the tests. All this comes in addition to digitalised text books that are cheap (between USD1 to USD10) (about Shs38,000).BeneficiariesThe beneficiary schools include: Mpummudde Secondary School in Jinja, Nabumali High School Mbale, Atutur Seed Secondary School in Soroti, Sir Tito Winyi Secondary School in Hoima, Kagamba Secondary School in Mbarara, Kyenjojo Secondary School in Fort Portal and St. Charles Lwanga SS, Kasasa in Masaka.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Digital-libraries-game-changer-rural-schools/688336-5101196-e93vek/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post43.png
40,Essay challenge brings students  knowledge on biotechnology to life - Daily Monitor,"In a bid to familiarise students with modern biotechnology, National Crop Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) organised the Biotechnology Essay Writing Contest among secondary and university students.Resty Nansubuga, the 17-year-old science student at St Joseph s Girls Senior Secondary School, who scooped the best essay award in the secondary school category, says she only learnt about plant breeding using modern biotechnology in a bid to develop Genetically Modified Organisms crops from her teacher recently.Her essay focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food under the theme;  Modern Biosciences for more nutritious food . She explained the use of breeding crops using advanced technology to develop improved varieties which have better nutrition and are high yielding hence capable of feeding the world s growing population.Organised by the Uganda Biosciences Information centre, the competition attracted several students who, like Nansubuga, had scanty knowledge about crop breeding. Widespread issueBut this lack of knowledge is also true in majority of Ugandans who are ignorant about plant breeding using modern biotechnology and mistake improved plant varieties such as hybrids with GMOs.Thus scientists at NaCRRI have put in efforts to sensitise school children right from primary to university level by organising essay competitions where the students are required to search for information about application of modern biotechnology in plant breeding. The 6th edition of the essay competition awardees were given certificates, plaques, laptops and a one-week internship training at NaCRRI.This was the first time most of the competing students were visiting the research institute and its laboratory where tissue culture cassava breeding is being done by breeding them in tests tubes. The students were also amazed to see tissue culture cassava growing from test tubes to a full plant in the field.Enlightened Nasubuga was excited to receive her award and promised to sensitise fellow students at her school and other communities on the importance of scientists using emerging technologies to breed crops. I do not see any difference between improved cassava, maize and rice varieties with the traditional varieties being tested at the institute. I have heard that many Ugandans are opposed to improved crop varieties but it seems people lack knowledge about what the scientists are doing,  she asserted. Students submitted essays under the topic modern Biosciences to produce better nutritious food while Nsubuga focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food citing orange sweet potato and cassava which is bred conventionally and pro vitamin A treangenic banana which contains Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.She is optimistic that she will encourage fellow students to read scientific books to get knowledge especially in Biosciences be it in crop breeding of applied science to developing vaccines and drugs in the health sector.For Marvin Steven Nsubuga, the overall winner in the tertiary and university category, this is his third time participating in the awards. He submitted his first essay in 2015 when he was a Senior Five student and won an accolade, a certificate and a one-week internship at the institute.Nsubuga, a first year Administrative Science student at Kyambogo University, researched on using applied modern biotechnology to breed crops which can be used as a raw material in order to boost the industrial sector. He focused on crops such cassava which farmers will be able to grow and get high yields which can be supplied to brewing industries.  The starch can also be used to process glue and highly processed cassava flour used by industries processing confectionary products. I am currently disseminating this information for government to make good policy,  he noted.On his third time competing, Nsubuga scooped a certificate, plaque, a laptop and a one week internship at the institute. More student researchHe is encouraging university students to be in search of scientific information, especially in agricultural science where scientists are breeding crops to address challenges of climate change and devising ways of feeding the growing population in the world.National Agricultural Research Organisation board chairman, Prof Joseph Obua, urged students to pursue science subjects because science is a driver and engine of economic growth of all nations. I am urging teachers to use the best methods when teaching science subjects; make it simple and practical. This is because children tend to shy away from science subjects because teachers are using complex words which scare them. It is important to simplify the words for students to appreciate science, technology and innovations,  he noted.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Essay-challenge-brings-students-knowledge-biotechnology-life-/688336-5101200-d2t4y2z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post44.png
41,Startup tips crucial to vocational students - Daily Monitor,"One of the major challenges vocational graduates face is lack of start-up capital despite being trained to be job creators not seekers. This sometimes forces them to end up in the job seekers pool which their training was trying to avoid.For a long time, Sophie Joyce Laker, a Fashion and Design student at Kitgum Technical Institute, would worry about starting a business citing lack of money. What Laker did not know though, was that mindset is the first capital and for as long as one s brain is functional, they can do anything they set out to do. She also came to learn that an entrepreneur must not keep complaining about challenges such as rent and delays in supplies but rather always devise solutions. The Fashion and Design student has since started a business; Rwot-Twero Workshop in Kitgum Town. But it was not until the Skills for Life programme recently that Laker realised all this and more about mentorship in business.Thirty youthful entrepreneurs from Kitgum Technical Institute and Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute in Gulu, received training in business start-ups and expansion skills from Enterprise Uganda experts, to ensure their dreams are realised. Subsequent follow-up visits to measure their progress coupled with mentorship have been ongoing since. Funded by Uganda Breweries (UBL), this expert training and mentoring under the Skills for Life programme aims at avoiding this. Launched in 2001, the programme has so far seen more than 114 scholarships awarded to academically deserving yet economically disadvantaged students with the aim of curbing youth unemployment and high school dropouts.The problemUganda s small and medium scale businesses are estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000; employing 2.5 million people (about 90 per cent of private sector jobs) and contributing about 20 per cent to the country s Gross Domestic Product, while producing 80 per cent of manufactured output. In fact, studies have ranked Uganda as one of the most entrepreneurial nations in the world. However, the business failure rate is equally high   standing at more than 50 per cent. This is due to various challenges, including lack of financial support and vital skills including entrepreneurial, management, marketing and financial planning. Other challenges include lack of business records, low corporate governance, poor banking and borrowing history, a culture that disrespects business contracts, fierce local and international competition and limited access to business development services.In fact Anjijuka Narasi Kambaho, the senior information and communication officer at Uganda Business and Technical Examinations Board, says starting personal businesses is not always easy for vocational trained graduates. There are expenses involved including purchasing the necessary equipment, paying rent and the required licenses needed for operation. Sometimes people want to first get formal jobs in order save and accumulate money for starting their own businesses later,  he says.Registered successAt Enterprise Uganda, a public-private institution aimed at promoting SMEs as the main vehicle for expanding production, providing sustainable jobs and enhancing economic growth, the Acholi youth are likely to avoid falling on the wayside like many similar businesses countrywide.  The mindset and entrepreneurship training model is an effective standard in transforming the behaviour of participants and triggering the desired action to start a business. This is corroborated by the statistic where 26 out of the 30 students actually started business after the December 2018 training, representing a 87 per cent success rate,  says Rosemary Mutyabule, the lead trainer. One such students is Nelson Mandela, of Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute who believes his poultry business can help him contribute to his family and community. Located in Custom-Corner Village, Layibi Division in Gulu municipality, Mandela s farm has 235 22-days old broiler chicks, fully vaccinated in line with the requirements from the trainers. During a visit to assess his business last month, it was discovered that Mandela, who mainly sells to roadside chicken roasters in Gulu Town feels his enterprise is delivering tangible benefits. He has earned Shs1.9m in chicken sales from his first stock giving him a profit of Shs300,000.  This poultry business is giving me a sense of purpose in life. I even sell the chicken droppings and earn at least Shs5,000 every 100kg sack,  Mandela says. Paul Otim, a Gulu-based business counsellor and mentor, who assessed Mandela s farm, believes, that though new, the enterprise has great potential to grow given the market opportunities available and the determination of the young entrepreneur.  A planned farm exposure visit will undoubtedly reinforce his potential to develop the business, especially on technical methods of handling the poultry, cost saving using local resources plus proper records management,  says Otim. Follow-upBroadly, the Skills for Life programme does not stop at the training or skilling phase, but the beneficiaries undergo various follow-up visits by the implementers who ensure the trainees  learning and development is in fulfillment of the programme s objectives.The latest additions to this initiative are 20 students of Kabale s African College of Commerce and Technology and another 20 from Datamine Institute in Kampala for whom UBL has provided up to about Shs115m to cover tuition for their second year of study, entrepreneurship training as well as seed capital for those that would have excelled in the programme.And for Sunday Auma Okee, an Electrical Systems and Maintenance student at Kitgum Technical Institute, the scholarship, aside from helping him stay in school, has helped him learn to start a business with what he has and in fact his dream of opening an electrical workshop seems closer. Interventions Edward Asiimwe, the principal at Uganda Rural Development and Training institute, says policy makers, the government in particular needs to support vocational training at all levels.  Just like in other education sectors, increased funding and investment is also mandatory in vocational institutions.  In addition, Asiimwe believes that students need to be continuously given the proper career guidance to enable them make better informed academic choices.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Startup-tips-crucial-vocational-students/688336-5101216-aaicob/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post45.png
42,"Influx of private schools, what s the catch  - Daily Monitor","Joseph Byaruhanga, earns Shs300,000 per month as a security guard. He has a family of three children to cater for, as well as paying other bills. His first two children attend a nearby private primary school in Namasuba, Zanna where he pays fees of Shs170,000 for each child totaling to Shs340,000 a term. Apart from tuition, he has to buy scholastic materials and other fees as directed by the school. Byaruhanga is not your rich parent but he sure is among the growing list of parents who year by year join the private schools trend as the best way to educate their children.  The problem with universal primary education schools is that the population in class is too high. It is possible to find more than 200 pupils in one class. Private schools have a small teacher to pupil ratio. You will find 50 pupils in a class which is manageable. A child in a class of many pupils will not learn anything and might take long to understand,  Byaruhanga says. In 1997, government introduced Universal Primary Education. Under this arrangement, four children in every family were to study free of charge in all government-aided primary schools. Almost 10 years after UPE, the government introduced Universal Secondary Education becoming the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education. But despite this, parents are increasingly parting with huge sums of money to educate their children in private schools. As such numbers of private schools increase each year.According to the Uganda Schools Guide website, as of today there are more than 13,000 private schools in 127 districts in Uganda. Among the private schools are the high end ones that offer foreign curriculums and target wealthy parents and the ones that target middle income earners. The endless challenges plaguing most public schools have increasingly eroded public confidence. They have been labelled as for the  poor  forcing some parents to take children to private schools where they hope to find better education for their children.The increase in enrollment of students has not only accelerated a rise in private schools across the country; but also the cost of education. Overwhelming numbersIn January 2018, Alex Kakooza, the permanent secretary of Ministry of Education and Sports while at the Senior One selection exercise at Uganda Manufacturers Association grounds announced that government had scrapped Universal Secondary Education in private schools under the Public Private Partnership (PPP). At the peak was a challenge of funding and an increasing number of ghost students. This did not go down well with parents who had fear of transferring their children to public schools for the USE programme dreading the appalling conditions of overcrowding. For instance, at Masindi Secondary School, a government funded school, students study in shifts; some in the morning to noon while others from 2pm to evening. According to Byaruhanga,  Some parents take their children to UPE schools because the tuition is relatively lower there. Personally I do not have much money but I want my children to at least have a good education. I would rather pay in installments to make sure that my children study in a private school. But the move to scrap USE from private schools was intended to raise money and ensure that every sub county has a public school. According to Kakooza, more than 615 government sub-counties had no secondary schools. At the time, government would pay Shs47,000 for each student per term in a private school under the USE programme. Mpumudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District is one of the new schools established by government to create equity in providing education across the country. However, since its establishment, the school is still housed in Mpumudde Primary School buildings with a few new classroom blocks. Sanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher, recently expressed worry over a surging student population with no facilities while at the launch of a digital library at the school.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space where to put this digital library. My teachers have nowhere to sit because the staffroom is now full of digital tablets,  he said.  We want extra building materials and land for expansion and creation of access roads and a laboratory with chemicals and equipment,  he added.Aggrey Kibenge, the undersecretary at the Ministry of Education and Sports who was the chief guest at the event gave a one worded response.  We shall look into the matter at the ministry.  High price to pay With appalling conditions in both public primary and secondary schools, private schools have been increasing over time to attend to the needs of frustrated parents but at a much higher cost.According to the ministry of Education, the Private Schools and Institutions department was inaugurated in 2008, consequent to the restructuring of the ministry to cater for the ever expanding private investment in education. Since the government decision to liberalise the education sector in 1993, thousands of schools and institutions have been set up by private investors. In the secondary sub-sector, the number of private schools, at about 4,000, is more than double the number of government-funded schools. Light Academy on Entebbe road is one such private school that specifically cater for the middle class who can afford the fees. Mahad Budda, a student at Light Academy (former Turkish), says the school charges between Shs1.8m and Shs2m per term and the fees increase termly. However, he says, the services are worth the money because the teacher-student ratio is low with each class stream having between 28 and 32 students. He adds that the sickbay is good with fulltime nurses as well as better accommodation.Other private schools around Kampala and Wakiso districts charge between Shs500,000 and Shs2m as tuition fees for either day or boarding section. Scraped fundingAt the start of 2018, the ministry of Education scrapped funding to 792 private secondary schools which had been implementing the Universal Secondary Education programme. The ministry officials argued that the government has built capacity over the years in areas where they did not have any government-aided schools and are now ready to absorb those students in these institutions, adding that this, however, will be done in phases. The move left an estimated number of students who were expected to benefit from the Public Private Partnership in Senior One stranded.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/private-schools-children-UPE-a-laboratory-parents/688336-5112742-11d5ivi/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-21/post46.png
43,The right time to get a master s degree - Daily Monitor,"There is an increase in the number of universities in the country, making it easy for one to acquire qualifications. And as such many young people are going for graduate studies soon after their undergraduate qualifications, and as with many issues, this, too, has its advantages and disadvantages. Before Rosta Asiimwe completed her undergraduate degree in Human Nutrition, she had applied for a Masters in Public Health Nutrition.  I worked on-and-off for five months with research organisations. That little experience motivated me to take my master s degree seriously. Previously, I was just going through the motions but then I became interested in research. Besides, the pay is good in research work. The advantage of rushing into a postgraduate programme early is that you are still young and have the time to concentrate. On the downside, you tend to continue in the same course you began at undergraduate level. Gaining work experience opens the mind to a variety of career choices. The merits of growing your career first Spending a few years in the work arena can help a person focus their career goals. Grace Kenganzi, who has a Bachelor s degree in Mass Communication, undertook a postgraduate in Media and Communications after working for more than three years in a media house.  By that time, I was sure of the experience I wanted to attain   the kind that I could not get from my workplace. I had majored in public relations in my undergraduate course and since I worked for a media organisation, I had learnt on the job. I was more deliberate as I looked for a postgraduate course; I did not want just any media course because in the future, I want to branch into communication,  said Kenganzi.Samuel Bakutana, the chief executive officer Inspired Leaders International, says by concentrating on growing a career, a person comes to terms with the real demands of the job world, instead of making up their mind based on what they are told in the lecture room.  The working experience gives you a more mature perspective. By the time I went for my Master s in Leadership, I was already aware of the glaring gaps, the available opportunities and the needs of my future work. I approached the studies with a more mature, sober and committed attitude,  he says, adding:  A working background enables you relate with the programme content at a more real, practical and personal level because you have gone through the scenarios (or have examples to draw from) being presented in the course materials as you progressively apply the new or renewed learning. The financial questionWhen you are younger, chances of getting a scholarship are higher than if you are above 35 years. However, all is not bleak.  There are specialised programmes, for example The Chevening Scholarship Programme, that only gives scholarships to people who have careers,  Kenganzi says, adding,  You can only know about them when you are working. If I studied my postgraduate much earlier, I would not have thought of studying abroad or applying for a scholarship. Generally, because a master s degree can be expensive and students may be uncertain about what they want to do with their lives, students should gain some real-world experience before beginning a master s degree programme.Fitting into the labour marketEmployers are comfortable employing someone who already has job experience because, from a purely financial perspective, training of new staff is expensive and may not pay off immediately. Kenganzi believes her work experience and her master s degree gives her an edge.  I know what I want and I will ask for it. I cannot just accept anything thrown my way.  Asiimwe is not so confident.  Getting a job will be quite tricky. In the Ugandan (labour) market, (work) experience is the password and I know those who have it have an advantage over me.
