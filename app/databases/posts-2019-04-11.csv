0,"Prince Harry, Meghan want baby's birth kept 'private' - Daily Monitor","Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan want to keep the arrival of their baby later this month ""private"", Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Thursday.This would contrast with the births of the three children of his brother Prince William and his wife Kate, immediately after which the babies were shown off by the couple in front of the world's media.""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very grateful for the goodwill they have received from people throughout the United Kingdom and around the world as they prepare to welcome their baby,"" the statement said.""Their Royal Highnesses have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.""The Duke and Duchess look forward to sharing the exciting news with everyone once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family,"" it said.Some British media have reported that the royal couple are considering a home birth, which would also break with the tradition followed by William and Kate of giving birth in the private wing of St Mary's Hospital in London.A source quoted by The Sun said the couple wanted a ""more private"" setting.""She just wants a normal, natural birth and to bond with her baby, without being primped and blow-dried to within an inch of her life just for the pictures,"" the source told the paper.Harry and Meghan currently live on the grounds of Kensington Palace in London, the residence of William and Kate. They are planning to move to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor ahead of the birth, media reports said.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Prince-Harry-Meghan-want-baby-s-birth-kept--private-/688340-5066840-ei4drfz/index.html,/static/img/post1.png
1,The heat is on in India's mega-election - Daily Monitor,"The sun beat down on Suman Sharma as she joined hordes of people queuing to cast ballots on the first day of India's mega-election Thursday, with voters putting the country's leaders under the spotlight.""I left all my housework to come here because I think every vote counts,"" the 50-year-old housewife said as she waited to vote in her home city of Ghaziabad, near the capital New Delhi.""I want a government that thinks about women and brings down the high prices of rice and lentils.""Sharma vented her frustration as temperatures headed towards 40 degrees Celsius (105 degrees Fahrenheit) even at 8.00am.""Cooking gas prices have gone up, sending children to school is expensive. It's difficult to run the household. I want the new government to think about middle classes,"" she grumbled.Under Indian law, media cannot report which party individual voters backed. But the handling of the economy by right-wing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom opinion polls have put as favourite, is one of the key issues.As separate queues for male and female voters steadily grew, tempers flared when one elderly woman asked if she could wait in the shade. A police officer attracted scorn when he replied she ""would not burn if she waited for two minutes in the sun"". First vote surge Some 170,000 polling stations opened for the first day of the election that is set to last almost six weeks, although results will only be announced on May 23.Women in multicolour saris pulled out parasols to shade themselves at polling stations across the northeast state of Assam, where authorities said 700,000 people voted in the first two hours in five constituencies.With two thirds of India's 1.3-billion population aged under 35, a huge number of first time voters were taking part. In the Assam town of Kaliabar, teenagers took selfies of themselves holding up their ink-stained fingers which proved they had voted.Twenty-three year-old Anurag Baruah started queueing an hour before the polling station opened in a local school.""It's a great feeling to cast the vote,"" he said. ""I feel part of the democratic system, responsible for electing a good leader who can run the country."" But in Kashmir, residents of the Himalayan region which has long been in the grip of a violent separatist insurgency shunned the election, while many of those who did vote were critical of the nationalist government in Delhi.Only one person voted in the first 45 minutes at the Azad Gunj polling station in Baramulla.About 100 police, paramilitaries and soldiers were visible, with men in riot gear positioned every 50 metres on the nearby road.A couple of voters agreed to talk, but declined to give their names.""My conscience normally doesn't allow me to vote, but I did to stop Modi and his party,"" said one man.Another, a shopkeeper, said: ""No one in my family wanted me to vote in an Indian election, but I have come out today to vote against the government and stop their onslaught on Kashmiri people.""Tight security was also imposed in two constituencies in West Bengal taking part in an Indian national election for the first time.The districts of Cooch Behar and Alipurduar were former Bangladeshi enclaves in India that were part of a 2015 land swap with the neighbouring country.Long queues formed outside polling stations. ""It is a historic day for the people of these former enclaves,"" said a Rabindranath Ghosh a candidate in the contest.""They are voting for a government for the first time after seven decades of stateless existence,"" he declared.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/The-heat-is-India-s-mega-election/688340-5066828-136kmvsz/index.html,/static/img/post2.png

3,World biggest election: Modi favourite as polls open in India - Daily Monitor,"The scion of the Gandhi dynasty told Indians that the country's ""soul"" was at stake on Thursday, as millions braved the hot sun to vote on day one of the world's biggest election.Opinion polls put Prime Minister Narendra Modi as favourite to win, but he faces a possible backlash from India's 900 million voters over unemployment and rural poverty.Because of India's vastness, Thursday marked just the first of seven phases in the election to take place from the tea plantations of Darjeeling to the slums of Mumbai to the tropical Andaman Islands, and everywhere in between.Security forces were on high alert due to the perennial danger of violence at election time, with five people including a local lawmaker killed in an ambush by suspected Maoist rebels this week. Online too, a war rages with social media awash with disinformation, fake news, trolls and bots in what is Facebook and WhatsApp's biggest market, where the world's cheapest data tariffs have fuelled a smartphone boom.Thousands of parties and candidates will run for office between now and May 19 in 543 constituencies across the nation of 1.3 billion people, with results not due until May 23.Some of the 1.1 million electronic voting machines will be transported through jungles and carried up mountains, including to a hamlet near the Chinese border with just one voter.Phase one on Thursday sees some 142 million people able to cast ballots. Indian voters hold their voting slips as they walk towards a polling station to cast their vote at Chandu Chak village of Ranbir Singh Pura sector in Jammu district in the state of Jammu and Kashmir on April 11, 2019. AFP PHOTOSPolling stations in northeastern states like Arunachal Pradesh bordering China were the first to open, followed by parts of Bihar in the north -- where women in multi-coloured saris queued -- and Jammu and Kashmir in the Himalayas.In Assam in the northeast, queues started forming 45 minutes before voting began, including many young people -- there are 84 million first-time voters in this election -- who were visibly excited.""It's a great feeling to cast the vote, which makes me a part of the democratic system and makes me responsible for electing a good leader who can run the country,"" Anurag Baruah, 23, told AFP. 'Good days' Modi appealed in an early-morning tweet to his almost 47 million followers on voters to ""turn out in record numbers and exercise their franchise.""Modi and his right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power in 2014 with their famous promise of ""achhe din"" (""good days""), becoming the first party to win an absolute majority in 30 years.Critics say the BJP has since sought to impose a Hindu agenda on India, emboldening attacks on Muslims and low-caste Dalits trading in beef -- cows are holy for Hindus -- re-writing school textbooks and re-naming cities.Modi has simplified the tax code and made doing business easier, but some of his promises have fallen short, particularly in rural areas where thousands of indebted farmers have killed themselves in recent years.Growth in Asia's third-biggest economy has been too slow to provide jobs for the roughly one million Indians entering the labour market each month, and unemployment is reportedly at its highest since the 1970s.Rahul Gandhi, 48, hoping to become the latest prime minister from his dynasty -- and aided by sister Priyanka -- has accused Modi of causing a ""national disaster"". ""No JOBS. DEMONETISATION. Farmers in Pain... Lies. Lies. Lies. Distrust. Violence. HATE. Fear,"" Gandhi tweeted on Thursday.

For her future. Vote wisely.""Gandhi's Congress party appeared in December last year to profit from voter dissatisfaction, winning three key state elections and chipping into the BJP's Hindi-speaking northern heartland.""I want a government that thinks about women and brings down the high prices of rice and lentils,"" Suman Sharman, 50, a housewife in Ghaziabad, told AFP.""Cooking gas prices have gone up, sending children to school is expensive. It's difficult to run the household. I want the new government to think about middle classes,"" she said. 'Empty suit' Gandhi, the great-grandson, grandson and son of three past premiers, has grown in stature since being derided in leaked US diplomatic cables in 2007 as an ""empty suit"".Election adverts show him hugging an emaciated peasant woman, while Congress's leftist manifesto pledges to end abject poverty by 2030 and give cash transfers to 50 million families.But Modi and the BJP's formidable campaign juggernaut -- the 68-year-old has been addressing three rallies a day in the campaign -- will be no pushover, promising a $1.4-trillion infrastructure blitz.Playing to its Hindu base, the BJP has also committed to building a grand temple in place of a Muslim mosque demolished by Hindu mobs in the northern city of Ayodhya in 1992.But perhaps crucially, India's latest military altercation with arch-rival Pakistan in February has allowed Modi to portray himself as the ""chowkidar"" (""watchman"") protecting mother India.""Nationalism is our inspiration and inclusion and good governance is our mantra,"" Modi, who even changed his Twitter handle to ""Chowkidar Narendra Modi"", said at the launch of his manifesto.But opinion polls are notoriously unreliable in India and much will depend on the BJP's performance in several key states, in particular Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.""It's difficult to predict,"" said Parsa Venkateshwar Rao, a veteran journalist and political commentator.""It reminds me of 2004 when (premier Atal Bihari) Vajpayee and the BJP lost when everyone expected them to win,"" he told AFP.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/World-biggest-election-Modi-favourite-as-polls-open-India/688340-5066792-6l2qhuz/index.html,/static/img/post4.png
4,Sudan army to make an 'important statement soon' - Daily Monitor,"The Sudanese army was Thursday planning to make ""an important announcement"", state media said, after months of protests against longtime leader President Omar al-Bashir.Thousands of Khartoum residents chanted ""the regime has fallen"" as they flooded the area around army headquarters where protesters have held an unprecedented sit-in now in its sixth day.""The Sudanese army will issue an important statement soon. Wait for it,"" the state television anchor said, without giving further details.The protests, which erupted in December, have become the biggest challenge yet to Bashir's three decades of iron-fisted rule.""We are waiting for big news,"" one protester told AFP from the sit-in.""We won't leave from here until we know what it is. But we do know that Bashir has to go.""We had enough of this regime -- 30 years of repression, corruption, rights abuses, it's enough.""Crowds of demonstrators have spent five nights defiantly camped outside the sprawling headquarters complex, which also houses Bashir's official residence and the defence ministry.There has been an often festive mood at the sit-in with protesters singing dancing to the tunes of revolutionary songs.Several military vehicles carrying troops entered the compound in the early hours of Thursday, witnesses said.And witnesses said many army vehicles carrying troops were deploying in the centre of Khartoum early Thursday.The group spearheading the nationwide demonstrations urged residents of the capital to mass outside army headquarters.""We call on our people from across the Khartoum capital and the region around to immediately go to the sit-in area and not leave from there until our next statement is issued,"" the Sudanese Professionals Association said.Death toll mountsThe demonstrators have braved repeated volleys of tear gas from members of the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) since they began camping outside the complex on April 6, protest organisers say.But for the first time on Tuesday night they did not face any ""threat"" from security agents, said a protester who requested anonymity for security reasons.That came after 11 people, including six members of the security forces, were killed on Tuesday during demonstrations in the capital, government spokesman Hassan Ismail told the official SUNA news agency.Officials say 49 people have died in protest-related violence since demonstrations first erupted in December.""I hope our revolution will achieve its goal,"" said Alaa Salah, dubbed the protest movement's ""Nubian queen"", using the ancient name for Sudan, after a video clip went viral of her conducting chants with demonstrators outside the army headquarters.Earlier this week, the US, Britain and Norway for the first time threw their weight behind the protesters.""The time has come for the Sudanese authorities to respond to these popular demands in a serious"" way, the countries' Khartoum embassies said in a statement.""The Sudanese authorities must now respond and deliver a credible plan for this political transition.""Sudan, along with Iran, Syria and North Korea, is on Washington's blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism. Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide, came to power in a 1989 coup. He remains one of the longest serving presidents in Africa.On Tuesday, security agents had to abort attempts to disperse the crowds when soldiers countered their volleys of tear gas by firing in the air, witnesses said.NISS said it was ""monitoring the demonstrations and discharging its duty according to law"".Troops stationed Sudan's police has ordered its forces not to intervene against protesters.""We call on God to preserve the security and calm of our country... and to unite the Sudanese people... for an agreement which would support the peaceful transition of power,"" it said in a statement.On Wednesday, protesters were raising funds to ensure a regular supply of food and water for the crowd.""Many shop owners and businessmen have offered us free supplies,"" said one demonstrator.Protesters have set up five big screens at the complex to screen football matches, an onlooker said.Witnesses said troops stationed vehicles mounted with machine-guns at the gates of the complex.The SPA said ""several members and leaders"" of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF) had given indications they would join the movement.The RSF is made up of Arab militias that fought on the side of government forces against rebels in Sudan's western region of Darfur in the initial years of the conflict.Bashir's ruling National Congress Party said plans to hold a rally backing the president on Thursday had been postponed.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Sudan-army-state-media-Khartoum-Omar-alBashir/688340-5066186-13ivbglz/index.html,/static/img/post5.png

Mr Kakooza said that after surrendering the money outside the bank, he returned to the banking hall where he was advised to alert police.

6,"1,800 UPDF soldiers leave for Somalia peace mission - Daily Monitor","The UPDF has sent 1,800 soldiers on a peace keeping mission in Somalia.The Chief of Defence Forces (CDF), Gen David Muhoozi, flagged off the soldiers on Wednesday at the Peace Support Operation Training Centre, in Nakeseke District.According to a statement, the 27th Battle Group will be commanded by Col Kosiya Kuteesa who will be deputised by Col Rodgers Okiror.Gen Muhoozi, according to the statement, told the soldiers that they are headed for tough times in the war-torn country and challenged them to use the skills they have acquired in the last six months of special training. The Somalia mission is not a picnic. It is a war situation. It is a do or die mission. Watch each other s back and ensure you adhere to the principles of war and standing operation procedures all the time,  Gen Muhoozi said.More than 100 UPDF soldiers have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab militias through surprise attacks, ambushes and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).The UPDF is in Somalia under African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), a peace keeping mission operated by the AU with the approval of the United Nations.The major incident that claimed lives of eight soldiers was in April last year when Al-Shabaab Islamist fighters attacked them as they returned to their camp.The army explained that the battle that left these soldiers lifeless, ensued after the suspected Al-Shabaab terrorists attempted to attack AMISOM Forward Operating Bases at Quoroyole, Buulo Mareer and Golwen in Lower Shabelle Region of Somalia.Gen Muhoozi told the combatants that they have gone to a war zone where operational mistakes can lead to loss of lives.The CDF reminded the soldiers that Somalia mission is built on the UPDF s pro-people ideology which is part of the reason for the Force s successes in its operations. As opposed to the previous perception that the Somalia mission was an impossible one, with discipline and adherence to rules of engagement, based on our pro-people ideology, we made the mission possible.  Gen Muhoozi said.The event was graced by the Commander Land Forces, Lt Gen Peter Elwelu, who also coordinates the Somalia Operations.Others who attended were the Chief of Training and Recruitment Maj Gen Willis Byarugaba, officials from US, UK and French Embassies in Kampala as well as Mr Curtis Crum, the country director for Global Peace Operation Initiative that helped in the training.

7,Finance cuts budget for essential drugs by Shs100b - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Health centres countrywide are likely to face a shortage of essential medicines after the Ministry of Finance slashed the budget for National Medical Stores  (NMS) for essential medicines by Shs100b.The Ministry of Health has, however, warned that the Shs100b budget shortfall will cripple health service delivery in the country.Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the minister of Health, in a telephone interview with Daily Monitor yesterday, said:  The implication is that we shall not be able to provide the needed services if the funds are not provided. Government needs to look for money to ensure that these items (essential medicines) are catered for. That is why they are called priorities.   My duty is to inform Parliament, the budget committee and other government departments that more funds should be allocated to cater for these priorities,  Dr Aceng added.The estimatesThe Ministry of Health, in its budget estimates for the Financial Year 2019/2020, requested that Ministry of Finance provides Shs496b to NMS to cater for special medicines, but only Shs396b has been availed, creating a shortfall of Shs100b. Some health units have previously experienced rampant drug stock outs, a situation that has compromised the health of Ugandans.The Shs100b shortfall is part of the Shs231b key unfunded priorities, which the ministry insists government must be availed to effectively run the health sector for the next financial year.The ministry had requested for an additional Shs100b on top of the Shs396.2b that was provided in the 2019/20 budget.The ministry says this unfunded priority will affect the provision of essential medicines to the hospitals and health centres.Overall, the Ministry of Health budget for the Financial Year 2019/2020 stands at about Shs1.2 trillion, up from Shs1.13 trillion for 2018/19 financial year. Among the other unfunded priorities is Shs43.5b outstanding arrears that haven t been cleared for the last three years. This is money that was meant to clear suppliers who have since threatened to sue the Ministry of Health, according to ministry officials. Dr Aceng said she was hopeful that the Finance ministry would source for some additional funds during the financial year to cater for the deficit. Along the financial year when revenue collection improves, the Finance ministry normally releases some additional funds to address some of these gaps, so I am hopeful that they will provide the funds to bridge the gaps,  she said.Officials from the NMS that has been hit hard by the cuts were not available to offer explanation on how they will handle the situation if the required funds are not given.The NMS spokesperson, Mr Dan Kimosho, could not be reached for a comment by press time. The chief executive officer, Mr Moses Kamabare, was reportedly out of office.The Ministry of Finance spokesperson, Mr Jim Mugunga, said:  The budget prioritizes essentials like medicines and health sector will certainly be given priority  however, it s not uncommon for sectors to lobby parliament to gain more than what was allocated through a consultative process. The reason why the oversight committees are in place is to scrutinise the budget proposals and expenditures. The prerogative is with Parliament and MPs are aware of what is in the kitty and the competing priorities.

8,"1,300 teachers, Education ministry staff to miss salary - Daily Monitor","Kampala. At least 1, 342 Ministry of Education staff will not get their May and June salaries unless the Finance ministry approves the request for a supplementary budget.Mr Aggrey Kibenge, the Ministry of Education undersecretary, confirmed yesterday that the permanent secretary, Mr Alex Kakooza, had written to Finance ministry seeking a supplementary budget of Shs1.3 billion to cater for 1,342 staff who include teachers and are likely to miss their June salary. Another 34 staff will miss their salaries on the May payroll.  We are not competent enough to say which teachers have not been paid or not. It is for Local Government, Finance and Public Service ministries to say. We are not the ones responsible for their wage bill. I can t say which local governments have a shortfall. They deal directly with Public Service ministry,  Mr Kibenge said in an interview. He added:  The permanent secretary has written to Finance informing them about the shortfall. It affects about 1,342 staff who may miss salary for June because there is a shortfall of Shs1.3 billion. In May, about 34 staff will also miss their salary. These are, however, headquarters staff. Sources within the ministry said the majority of 1,342 staff who are likely to miss their June salary are teachers. In February, while responding to questions arising from a World Bank report on the country s education particularly on teacher deployment, Mr Kakooza admitted that they had had challenges of teachers already on payroll being deleted without explanation. He further told participants at the launch of the  Facing Forward Schooling for learning in Africa  report that some of their staff were going to miss salary despite being on the payroll this financial year. He did not specify who would miss the salaries.  Teachers are complaining of delays in accessing the payroll. That is an issue of Local Government ministry. We have had people knocked off the payroll, we have had people not getting their salaries even when they are on the payroll,  Mr Kakooza said. He added:  We have written requesting for a supplementary budget because we don t have enough money to fill the positions. Even the people who are on the payroll may not be paid if we don t have extra funding from Ministry of Finance before the closure of this year.  No explanationWhen we requested an explanation from Mr Kakooza on why some of the staff in his ministry will miss their pay, he referred us to the ministry s commissioner in charge of human resource, Ms Jane Mwesiga.Ms Mwesiga, too referred us to Mr Kibenge who confirmed a request for the supplementary budget. It is not clear whether the problem was a result of under- budgeting or a mistake in the payroll system. Mr Kakooza was reportedly out of the country yesterday. Mr Filbert Baguma, the Uganda National Teachers Union Association general secretary, yesterday said there is continuous unexplained deletion of teachers from the payroll every month.  Deletions of teachers off the payroll continue on a monthly basis. Some are removed and others put back. Local Government ministry says they submitted the records for public servants but when returns come back, some people are not there,  Mr Baguma said.He said the education workers are likely to miss their May and June salaries because of inefficiencies by Local Government ministry.  How do you budget for salary  You know the numbers, the amount of money they are getting and when you pay them for 10 months out of 12, you say their salaries are finished on the vote of salaries. How would that happen  There must be foul play because projections are very clear,  Mr Baguma said.The Ministry of Local Government permanent secretary, Mr Benjamin Kumumanya, did not respond to our inquiries since February about the discrepancies in the payroll. Ms Mary Apasiat, the Local Government public relations officer, said Mr Kumumanya was engaged in a meeting and was not available for a comment.

9,"Government asks for Shs620b to capitalise BoU, 5 banks - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government has run to Parliament seeking approval of Shs620.7 billion for the planned recapitalisation of Bank of Uganda and other five banks.For BoU, Ministry of Finance officials told MPs on Finance Committee yesterday that Shs484.2b is urgently needed to cover for deficits and losses accumulated since 2013.This was revealed by Mr Lawrence Ssemakula, the Accountant General in the Ministry of Finance while appearing before the House Committee on Finance to present a ministerial policy statement on Treasury operations.Mr Ssemakula told the committee chaired by Rubanda East MP Henry Musasizi (NRM) that the Central Bank had indicated to the Ministry that it had suffered deficits since June 2013 and that the money was needed to avert an impending crisis. They [BoU] have indicated that they have been impaired from June 2013. So as per the BoU Act, we have no option but to allocate the money in our budget since their operations are in deficits,  Mr Ssemakula said.When MPs asked whether the ministry had done due diligence on the request by the Central Bank managers, Mr Ssemakula said the deficits are captured in the Auditor General s reports. According to the ministerial statement for the 2018/2019 Financial Year (FY), Shs484.2b capitalisation fund for BoU is expected to increase the budgetary allocation towards payment of domestic debt from Shs2.3 trillion in 2018/19 FY to Shs3.2 trillion in 2019/20 FY. The Shs3.2 trillion domestic debt budget includes Shs62b for Contingency Fund, Shs140b for court awards arrears, Shs510b for treasury bills interest, Shs2.04 trillion for treasury bonds costs, Shs1.2b for listing fees and Shs750m for bank charges. The latest BoU request for capitalisation first came to the attention of Parliament in May last year with a request for Shs474b.Mr Muhakanizi had previously written to the Clerk of Parliament, explaining that BoU had registered a deficit of Shs17b and talked of operating losses of Shs457b on account of  monetary policy  and  currency costs . This projected deficit in the core capital position, together with the required core capital position of Shs30b, puts the additional recapitalisation securities to the tune of Shs504b,  Mr Muhakanizi s letter reads in part.Although BoU and ministry of finance officials had warned of an impending economic crisis, MPs on the budget committee rejected the request because it had come at the tail end of the budgeting process and members needed time to scrutinise the request. The MPs last year accused the Finance ministry of  stampeding Parliament  and insisted that the losses at BoU were not fully explained, and that the request recapitalisation came at the end of the budgeting process. Some committee members, however, called for an investigation into the cause of losses and deficits at BoU before injecting the taxpayers money in the bank. The State Minister for Microfinance, Mr Haruna Kasolo, revealed that government plans to spend Shs141.2b on five other banks.The Director Budget, Mr Keneth Mugambe, told the MPs that the banks to be capitalised included Uganda Development Bank, Post Bank, Housing Finance, Trade and Development Bank, and African Development Bank.Parliament is expected to vote on the government request for capitalisation of Bank of Uganda and other banks.Distributing Shs620.7b [email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-asks-Shs620b-capitalise-BoU-5-banks/688334-5066054-txah1bz/index.html,/static/img/post10.png
10,Government to open second round of oil licensing - Daily Monitor,"A new round of competitive bidding for oil exploration licenses for the Albertine Graben is slated for early next month. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Energy and Mineral Development Minister, Ms Irene Muloni said  seven new exploration blocks will be open for bidding during the second week of May to coincide with the East African Community Petroleum Conference that is scheduled to take place in Mombasa, Kenya.It is the second time that Uganda is offering oil exploration deals under open bidding. The last round of bidding saw Armour Energy from Australia and Oranto Petroleum from Nigeria emerge as the best bidders. Government signed deals with the companies worth more than Shs7 billion.The minimum requirements for bidders have not yet been stipulated by the ministry but will be revealed at the conference, Ms Muloni said.The area that is being put up for bidding has three commercial areas that cover both onshore and offshore blocks.According to Ms Muloni, about 1,200 kilometres of oil exploitation are being targeted.Three other companies have been given licenses. These include; CNOOC, Total and Tullow Oil.So far, 10 percent (6 billion barrels of oil) of the country s oil capacity was established in the first round of licensing.Ms Muloni says that with the second round, new areas of the Albertine Graben have been opened.   We have so far allocated 10 percent of the Graben to the existing firms. From the remaining 90 percent of the Graben, we have picked data and it is this data that has helped us with the forming of these new blocks,  she said.READ: Uganda revises first oil production to 2022  ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-oil-licensing-Armour-Energy-Oranto/688334-5066362-67489c/index.html,/static/img/post11.png
11,"Help local communities benefit from tourism, experts tell government - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government should find innovative ways of helping communities around protected areas earn from tourism if they are to appreciate and protect the parks, experts have suggested.Dr Dilys Roe, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), a London-based think-tank, said if communities feel that parks do not benefit them, they resort to poaching.She made the remarks while giving a keynote address into the threats to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and some innovative ideas for new community-based solutions in Kampala last week. The lecture was organised by Aga Khan Development Network. Citing their nearly two years  experience in helping communities around Bwindi tap into tourism, Dr Roe said many people can benefit from gorilla tracking indirectly through selling items to tourists. Gorillas are key attraction in Uganda. They are particularly important because there aren t many countries in the world where you can find gorillas. So the tourism market is here or in Rwanda,  she said.  That really sounds positive, but the other side of the story is where that money goes. Dr Roe said local communities can earn from tourism if they are trained to work as professional guides, sell food or offer authentic cultural experiences and not necessarily wait for the 10 per cent park revenue ploughed back by government. TrainingShe said IIED has already trained some residents to offer the services.Gorilla-tracking in Bwindi generates revenue for conservation, but local benefits from tourism are limited and the illegal use of the park s resources continues.Tourism is a top foreign exchange earner and Uganda last year raked in $1.4b (Shs5 trillion) from the sector, according to government statistics.Mr Amin Mawji, the Aga Khan Development Network representative in Uganda, said the lectures are aimed at creating  a space for conversation... a space for illumination where leaders and opinion formers can come together to reflect on the big issues of our time, to explore new ideas and fresh perspectives, and to promote new solutions to the problems that face us and our children. The lecture examined some of the challenges facing the tourism sector. Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, the Tourism minister, lauded the Aga Khan Development Network for organising the lecture and contributing to the development of Uganda.He said government is committed to conserving the environment but sometimes they are let down by rampant poverty among Ugandans, bad attitude and the growing population of people and animals that compete for space.The lecture was attended by Mr Daudi Migereko, the chairman of Uganda Tourist Board, several ambassadors and senior leadership of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Help-local-communities-benefit-from-tourism-experts-tell-govt/688334-5063750-gaoykg/index.html,/static/img/post12.png

13,The heat is on in India's mega-election - Daily Monitor,"The sun beat down on Suman Sharma as she joined hordes of people queuing to cast ballots on the first day of India's mega-election Thursday, with voters putting the country's leaders under the spotlight.""I left all my housework to come here because I think every vote counts,"" the 50-year-old housewife said as she waited to vote in her home city of Ghaziabad, near the capital New Delhi.""I want a government that thinks about women and brings down the high prices of rice and lentils.""Sharma vented her frustration as temperatures headed towards 40 degrees Celsius (105 degrees Fahrenheit) even at 8.00am.""Cooking gas prices have gone up, sending children to school is expensive. It's difficult to run the household. I want the new government to think about middle classes,"" she grumbled.Under Indian law, media cannot report which party individual voters backed. But the handling of the economy by right-wing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom opinion polls have put as favourite, is one of the key issues.As separate queues for male and female voters steadily grew, tempers flared when one elderly woman asked if she could wait in the shade. A police officer attracted scorn when he replied she ""would not burn if she waited for two minutes in the sun"". First vote surge Some 170,000 polling stations opened for the first day of the election that is set to last almost six weeks, although results will only be announced on May 23.Women in multicolour saris pulled out parasols to shade themselves at polling stations across the northeast state of Assam, where authorities said 700,000 people voted in the first two hours in five constituencies.With two thirds of India's 1.3-billion population aged under 35, a huge number of first time voters were taking part. In the Assam town of Kaliabar, teenagers took selfies of themselves holding up their ink-stained fingers which proved they had voted.Twenty-three year-old Anurag Baruah started queueing an hour before the polling station opened in a local school.""It's a great feeling to cast the vote,"" he said. ""I feel part of the democratic system, responsible for electing a good leader who can run the country."" But in Kashmir, residents of the Himalayan region which has long been in the grip of a violent separatist insurgency shunned the election, while many of those who did vote were critical of the nationalist government in Delhi.Only one person voted in the first 45 minutes at the Azad Gunj polling station in Baramulla.About 100 police, paramilitaries and soldiers were visible, with men in riot gear positioned every 50 metres on the nearby road.A couple of voters agreed to talk, but declined to give their names.""My conscience normally doesn't allow me to vote, but I did to stop Modi and his party,"" said one man.Another, a shopkeeper, said: ""No one in my family wanted me to vote in an Indian election, but I have come out today to vote against the government and stop their onslaught on Kashmiri people.""Tight security was also imposed in two constituencies in West Bengal taking part in an Indian national election for the first time.The districts of Cooch Behar and Alipurduar were former Bangladeshi enclaves in India that were part of a 2015 land swap with the neighbouring country.Long queues formed outside polling stations. ""It is a historic day for the people of these former enclaves,"" said a Rabindranath Ghosh a candidate in the contest.""They are voting for a government for the first time after seven decades of stateless existence,"" he declared.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/The-heat-is-India-s-mega-election/688340-5066828-136kmvsz/index.html,/static/img/post14.png

15,World biggest election: Modi favourite as polls open in India - Daily Monitor,"The scion of the Gandhi dynasty told Indians that the country's ""soul"" was at stake on Thursday, as millions braved the hot sun to vote on day one of the world's biggest election.Opinion polls put Prime Minister Narendra Modi as favourite to win, but he faces a possible backlash from India's 900 million voters over unemployment and rural poverty.Because of India's vastness, Thursday marked just the first of seven phases in the election to take place from the tea plantations of Darjeeling to the slums of Mumbai to the tropical Andaman Islands, and everywhere in between.Security forces were on high alert due to the perennial danger of violence at election time, with five people including a local lawmaker killed in an ambush by suspected Maoist rebels this week. Online too, a war rages with social media awash with disinformation, fake news, trolls and bots in what is Facebook and WhatsApp's biggest market, where the world's cheapest data tariffs have fuelled a smartphone boom.Thousands of parties and candidates will run for office between now and May 19 in 543 constituencies across the nation of 1.3 billion people, with results not due until May 23.Some of the 1.1 million electronic voting machines will be transported through jungles and carried up mountains, including to a hamlet near the Chinese border with just one voter.Phase one on Thursday sees some 142 million people able to cast ballots. Indian voters hold their voting slips as they walk towards a polling station to cast their vote at Chandu Chak village of Ranbir Singh Pura sector in Jammu district in the state of Jammu and Kashmir on April 11, 2019. AFP PHOTOSPolling stations in northeastern states like Arunachal Pradesh bordering China were the first to open, followed by parts of Bihar in the north -- where women in multi-coloured saris queued -- and Jammu and Kashmir in the Himalayas.In Assam in the northeast, queues started forming 45 minutes before voting began, including many young people -- there are 84 million first-time voters in this election -- who were visibly excited.""It's a great feeling to cast the vote, which makes me a part of the democratic system and makes me responsible for electing a good leader who can run the country,"" Anurag Baruah, 23, told AFP. 'Good days' Modi appealed in an early-morning tweet to his almost 47 million followers on voters to ""turn out in record numbers and exercise their franchise.""Modi and his right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to power in 2014 with their famous promise of ""achhe din"" (""good days""), becoming the first party to win an absolute majority in 30 years.Critics say the BJP has since sought to impose a Hindu agenda on India, emboldening attacks on Muslims and low-caste Dalits trading in beef -- cows are holy for Hindus -- re-writing school textbooks and re-naming cities.Modi has simplified the tax code and made doing business easier, but some of his promises have fallen short, particularly in rural areas where thousands of indebted farmers have killed themselves in recent years.Growth in Asia's third-biggest economy has been too slow to provide jobs for the roughly one million Indians entering the labour market each month, and unemployment is reportedly at its highest since the 1970s.Rahul Gandhi, 48, hoping to become the latest prime minister from his dynasty -- and aided by sister Priyanka -- has accused Modi of causing a ""national disaster"". ""No JOBS. DEMONETISATION. Farmers in Pain... Lies. Lies. Lies. Distrust. Violence. HATE. Fear,"" Gandhi tweeted on Thursday.

It's difficult to run the household. I want the new government to think about middle classes,"" she said. 'Empty suit' Gandhi, the great-grandson, grandson and son of three past premiers, has grown in stature since being derided in leaked US diplomatic cables in 2007 as an ""empty suit"".Election adverts show him hugging an emaciated peasant woman, while Congress's leftist manifesto pledges to end abject poverty by 2030 and give cash transfers to 50 million families.But Modi and the BJP's formidable campaign juggernaut -- the 68-year-old has been addressing three rallies a day in the campaign -- will be no pushover, promising a $1.4-trillion infrastructure blitz.Playing to its Hindu base, the BJP has also committed to building a grand temple in place of a Muslim mosque demolished by Hindu mobs in the northern city of Ayodhya in 1992.But perhaps crucially, India's latest military altercation with arch-rival Pakistan in February has allowed Modi to portray himself as the ""chowkidar"" (""watchman"") protecting mother India.""Nationalism is our inspiration and inclusion and good governance is our mantra,"" Modi, who even changed his Twitter handle to ""Chowkidar Narendra Modi"", said at the launch of his manifesto.But opinion polls are notoriously unreliable in India and much will depend on the BJP's performance in several key states, in particular Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.""It's difficult to predict,"" said Parsa Venkateshwar Rao, a veteran journalist and political commentator.""It reminds me of 2004 when (premier Atal Bihari) Vajpayee and the BJP lost when everyone expected them to win,"" he told AFP.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/World-biggest-election-Modi-favourite-as-polls-open-India/688340-5066792-6l2qhuz/index.html,/static/img/post16.png
16,Kabale market traders demand extension of eviction deadline - Daily Monitor,"Kabale. A section of traders operating in Kabale Central Market have asked the authorities to give them three more months to vacate the market ahead of its reconstruction.Kabale Municipality leaders have given the traders up to May 1 to vacate the market ahead of its redevelopment at a cost of Shs25 billion under the Markets and Agricultural Trade Improvement Programme (MATIP), which is funded by African Development Bank.However, the traders under their umbrella body, Kabale Central Market Traders Association, on Monday said they need the three months to conduct fresh registration of people operating in the market.During a meeting convened by the town clerk, Mr Joseph Monday, and addressed by the mayor, Mr Sentaro Byamugisha, and the MATIP facilitator, Mr Emmanuel Mwebaze, the traders said the first registration exercise was not transparent as it was conducted by intruders. We want our market reconstructed but our rights as traders holding occupation permits must be observed. We also need the municipal council to issue written documents, confirming that all lock up owners and venders shall retain ownership of their lockups and operation spaces they have been occupying after reconstruction,  said Mr Simon Mashemererwa, the traders  chairperson. We need also municipal council to avail us a relocation plan and sites where we shall be operating as the reconstruction process goes on,  he added. Mr Mashemererwa and the secretary for defence, Mr George Kabagambe, also accused the municipal council of imposing on the traders another chairperson in the names of Mr Benson MfitumukizaMr Monday, however, said registration will not be repeated. The list of the registered vendors is available at the Kabale Central Market notice boards for viewing and anyone with a complaint can register it with the complaint handling desk in the market. Soon my office will advise and guide you on the relocation sites,  he said.The deputy RDC, Mr Gad Rugaju, asked the traders to end their conflicts with the council authorities to allow reconstruction to start.  Government goes with the majority. If the majority have agreed to vacate their business premises, the minority still opposing should follow suit. Endure the pain for the cause of development in your area,  he said.About the marketBackground: In December last year, Kabale Central Market Traders Association petitioned Kabale High Court, asking it to stop registration of vendors by the municipal council, claiming the exercise was not being done in a proper way. They also asked court to issue an interim order but the applications have never been handled. During the Monday meeting, some traders also declined to sign the memorandum of understanding with government on the market reconstruction, saying they need to first study it and be sure their rights and interests are protected.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kabale-market-traders-demand-extension-eviction-deadline/688334-5065878-m8hi9/index.html,/static/img/post17.png
17,"Government, aid agency to resume receiving South Sudan refugees - Daily Monitor","Yumbe. Humanitarian aid agency United Nation High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) are negotiating plans to resume receiving more South Sudanese refugees at Bidi Bidi refugee settlement camp in Yumbe District, Daily Monitor has learnt.OPM had earlier stopped receiving the refugees in December 2016 after the population at the centre was estimated to be 270,000.However biometric verification conducted jointly by OPM and UNHCR last year indicated that there were 224,000 South Sudanese refugees at Bidi Bidi settlement.Mr Juliao Acacio Jafar, the UNHCR head of sub office in Yumbe District, told Daily Monitor at the weekend that the current population of refugees at the settlement camp means they are able to offer space and services to more refugees. After the Biometric verification, we came with a population of 224,000. This means the services established to carter for 260,000 refugees can still accommodate more,  he said.Mr Jafar said they are currently in discussions with OPM to reconsider accommodating more refugees in the settlement camp.Bidi Bidi refugee settlement sits on a 240Sq Km piece of land.The Relief and Disaster Preparedness State Minister, Mr Musa Ecweru, told Daily Monitor in an interview recently that OPM is heading to Bidi Bidi refugee settlement camp for discussions before undertaking any further steps on receiving refugees.Survey The OPM, UNHCR teams are heading to Bidi Bidi refugee settlement on Wednesday (yesterday), we want to acquaint ourselves with the situation at the settlement. After touring the facilities and the area, we shall come out with our position,  Mr Ecweru said.The Yumbe District chairperson, Mr Taban Yasin, said the district has no problem with OPM and UNHCR decisions to add more refugees arguing that the land given is big enough to host up to 300,000 refugees.He said two more sub-counties of Drajini and Lodonga offered land to host the refugeess We have no problem with it. It s the discretion of UNHCR and OPM to add or stop receiving refugees, the land we gave them is enough to host more refugees,  Mr Yasin said.Renewed violenceLast week, 50 South Sudanese refugees camped at Kitgum Police Station in Kitgum District after fleeing from renewed threats of violence from the neighbouring Imatong state in South Sudan. The refugees included 45 children and five adults.

18,Leaders suspend fishing on Lake Kyoga for 2 months - Daily Monitor,"Nakasongola. Leaders in districts sharing Lake Kyoga have suspended fishing activities for two months to allow the Fisheries Protection Unit (FPU) coordinate the registration of fishermen and their boats.The measure is aimed at regulating illegal fishing activities and conserving water bodies.In a meeting also attended by FPU, at Amolatar District headquarters on Tuesday, the leaders endorsed several resolutions, including using only the recommended 28-inch boats. We have announced amnesty for everybody with illegal fishing gear to hand it over for destruction,  Mr Sam Kigula, the chairperson of Lake Kyoga Integrated Management Organisation (Lakimo), said on Tuesday. The districts under Lakimo include Nakasongola, Pallisa, Amolatar, Kamuli, Apac, Dokolo, Buyende, Kaliro, Soroti, Kaberamaido, Serere, Katakwi, Ngora, Dokolo and Kumi.The move comes after the Ministry of Agriculture said boat owners must have the recommended size of boats and fishing gear, Tax Identification Numbers and National Identity cards. Boat owners who are not fishermen are required to first secure fishing licences for their fishermen at Shs25,000 to be registered.Mr Dan Muganga, the Nakasongola Resident District Commissioner, said Lakimo member districts together with FPU also resolved to evict residents settling on suds (floating Islands).The settlers, mainly fishermen, have reportedly defied attempts by authorities to force them back to the main land. The district security committees have detailed reports regarding the criminal acts orchestrated by those people. They are lawless and irresponsible. Our resolve to have them back to the main land is to ensure that we do not have people who live a life full of criminality simply because they are not within the easy reach of the law enforcers,  Mr Muganga said. Ms Margaret Komuhangi, the Nakasongola District Woman MP, said the residents dispose of the wastes directly into the lake because they lack lavatory facilities and garbage pits. We had failed because all the sensitisation activities undertaken fell on deaf ears. We should now rally behind the UPDF to save the lake,  Ms Komuhangi saidLt Col James Nuwagaba, the FPU commander, commended the leaders for their cooperation to save the lake. There have been complaints by politicians, including the fishing community who claim their motorcycles and vehicles are illegally confiscated during our operations. So, with their support now, our work will be easy,  he said.Mr James Oloka, a fisherman from Namasale Landing Site in Amolatar, welcomed the suspension. We engaged in bad fishing methods and we are now regretting. The fish stock has drastically reduced and our families have to look for an alternative source of livelihood. We are only worried that we might not afford the 28-inch boats recommended on the lake. The boats are very expensive for an ordinary fisherman because they use engines,  Mr Oloka said.A recommended boat costs about Shs6m and above.TrendSuspension of fishing on Lake Kyoga comes three months after local leaders from Pallisa and Ngora districts also resolved to suspend all fishing activities on Lake Nyaguo to allow communities have standard fishing gear. A similar exercise kicked off on Lake Victoria last year where boat owners are already registering their boats.Illegal fishing on Ugandan lakes has reduced fish stocks, especially in species such as tilapia, Nile perch and silver fish-something that has drastically affected the country s export earnings from fish.

19,Youth demand RDC resignation - Daily Monitor,"JINJA. A group of youth yesterday stormed the Jinja District Council meeting that had been called to approve the budget for the financial year 2019/2020, demanding the resignation of the Jinja Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Mr Eric Sakwa.The Jinja District Council speaker, Mr Michael Musana Nyende, was forced to adjourn the meeting.The youth, who carried placards written on:  Sakwa, it is now the time for you to leave Jinja ,  President save us by taking away Sakwa , accused him of abusing their leaders.The council later restarted amid deployment at every entrance of the chambers to prevent the youth from disrupting the meeting.The Council approved a Shs45b budget estimate with an appeal by the speaker to always petition his office in case of any grievances, other than using violent means.Mr Nyenda said he forwarded their concerns to the Executive so that they come up with a recommendation about the behaviours of Mr Sakwa before they take action.Mr Sakwa was absent from the Council meeting.Leaders want respectJinja District chairperson Titus Kisambira urged Mr Sakwa to desist from calling fellow leaders lucky fools, illiterate and thieves. The law mandates him as RDC that if he feels discontented in any area, he is free to write to Inspectorate of Government or any other institution to investigate the leaders instead of insulting us through the media,   Mr Kisambira said. He added that they will not take his behaviour lightly.Mr Kisambira said as an executive after their findings, they will request for a special Council meeting to come up with a recommendation on the behaviours of Mr Sakwa.However, when contacted, Mr Sakwa said he would continue fighting leaders who engage in corruption and land grabbing. Although they plan to chase me out of Jinja, it will not work out because the law allows them only to recommend to the President and he decides the next step,   he said.This comes at a time when the municipality speaker, Mr Moses Bizitu, condemned Mr Sakwa during a Council meeting of calling them useless yet they are all leaders.Mr Bizitu said although he [Sakwa] has the mandate from the President, who appointed him, they also have a mandate from the people who elected them.On Thursday last week, Mr Sakwa was allegedly involved in a squabble with his deputy, Mr Abel Bakunda, during a security meeting at the district headquarters.According to sources, the altercation followed a heated argument which was triggered by a prolonged contest over stamps by Mafubira and Namulesa villages.The National Resistance Movement (NRM) chairpersons from both villages had reportedly surrendered their stamps to the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) while those from the Opposition Forum for Democratic Party (FDC) had not.Mr Sakwa had allegedly issued an order of retrieving the stamps from FDC chairpersons; however, chaos ensued when Mr Bakunda overruled him on grounds that majority of the chairpersons had decided that court resolves the issue.Mr Sakwa reportedly said he is the RDC, and wondered why Mr Bakunda opposes him yet he is also the head of security.This was then followed by a prolonged exchange of words which degenerated into a physical confrontation before the CAO, Mr William Kanyesigye, and the District Security Officer, Mr Jude Kyobulungi, intervened.Mr Sakwa also accused Mr Bakunda of mobilising residents, councillors, the media, and mafias to fight him, citing an incident at Spire Road Primary School when residents stopped him from addressing them during a meeting aimed at resolving grabbing of the school s land.On December 5, 2018, Mr Sakwa survived being beaten by the councillor representing Jinja Central Division, Mr Meddie Mbentyo, after he allegedly referred to councillors as  thieves  during a district council meeting.About SakwaMr Sakwa was once deputy RDC for Jinja but was transferred to Kumi District in 2016 after questioning the alleged money collected from factories in Jinja by some leaders to fund the National Independence Day celebrations held in Luuka District in 2016 yet government had released the money.While still serving as the Jinja deputy RDC, Mr Sakwa was known for arresting medical workers involved in extortion of money from patients and also steal government drugs.Mr Sakwa, who was once a diehard of Uganda Peoples Congress Party before crossing to the NRM, returned to Jinja in 2018 after being appointed by the President as a full RDC deputised by Mr Bakunda.However, after the last week s scuffle, Mr Bakunda was transferred to Kalangala District and replaced by Ms Hanifa Kaladi.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Youth-demand-RDC-resignation/688334-5065956-n2ewa7/index.html,/static/img/post20.png

The  marriage  of two minors in Buyende District has sparked uproar and a call to protect children s rights.Last week, a nine-year-old boy and six-year-old girl, both allegedly born with two teeth - got  married  at a ceremony in Nakapyata, drawing mixed reactions from the public.Mr Robert Wafula, the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) project coordinator, said the children should enjoy their rights and protection despite cultural connotations.CEDAW is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly.Mr Wafula appreciated that the children are at school but regretted that their coverage, especially by television stations did not take into consideration protection policies. Their faces were not covered so once they grow up and abandon the culture and marriage, they will be haunted and traumatised,  he said. We call for communities, cultures and norms that promote children rights. It is wrong to call it a marriage or initiation and while we appreciate it in the context of culture, engaging them is wrong,  Mr Wafula added.READ:Boy aged nine marries six-year-old in BuyendeMr Henry Woira, the Isabalangira of Bugabula Chiefdom, which covers Buyende and Kamuli districts, said in Busoga Kingdom,  spirits  choose a wife who should be kept clean and virgin until she is above 18. King Mswati III of Swailand carries out an annual marriage (Reed Dance) where he is mandated to choose a virgin, often young. Aware that culture grows, Busoga blends the traditional and modern positive values and has partnered with both government and NGOs to fight child marriages, domestic violence and western invasion,  he said.Mr Woira denied reports that the children are married or sleep together in coital relationship but only carry traditional visits to their respective families, get introduced to their spirits and are encouraged to complete school.  Traditionally arranged marriages monitor virginity, keep closer relations and later bring her home. Culturally, we cherish marriage readiness and purity. That is why we offer a goat to the Ssenga (aunt) when the girl s virginity is proved at marriage,  Mr Woira said.He said traditionally arranged marriages are often meant to check against genetically transferred illnesses such as sickle cells.Ms Mandwa Kagulu Nabiryo, the custodian of Bugabula Chiefdom spirits, said the ceremony was a cultural visit in which the two were introduced to the spirits at Iyingo shrine in Kagulu Sub-county. Cultural rituals were performed to strengthen them since they are both children of the spirits. The marriage was planned and is being monitored by spirits. [The girl] will continue living with her parents until she has made 18 years then they come together as husband and wife,  Ms Nabiryo said. She said in the past, parents would  book  daughters-in-law in advance and tie a red cloth around their wrists as a sign of engagement, with vows to keep them virgins.BACKGROUNDIn December 2013, a six-months-old girl  introduced  her three-year-old fianc  to her parents in Kamwokya-Namata Village, Buyengo Sub-county in Jinja District. A memorandum of understanding was reached with the boy s entourage accepting to pay the  dowry  of 48 cows, 48 goats, 48 chicken and 48 pots of malwa (local millet brew), among others, as instructed by Nambi s clan. The boy was allegedly born with two grown teeth in his lower jaw while holding a handful of two-root (herbs) grains in the right hand. When he was six months old, his clan oracle broke the news that his  wife-to-be , known as Nambi, was to be born three years later. In May 2013, the girl was reportedly born with two mature teeth in the lower jaw and  spoke  on delivery.Shocked, the parents went home and broke the news, much to the shock and awe of many.In consultation with the oracle, Kintu s parents located Mzeeyi Gamukibya s home for an interaction to narrate their ordeals and the kids  similarities.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Protect-children-rights-amid-cultural-norms-activist/688334-5064184-78cw1dz/index.html,/static/img/post21.png
21,Njeru Stock Farm land woes: Authorities ask for Shs1.3b - Daily Monitor,"BUIKWE. The controversy surrounding the land giveaway at Njeru Stock Farm in Buikwe District has taken a new twist, with Njeru Municipality authorities saying they are demanding Shs1.3b in unpaid nominal ground rent from government, Daily Monitor has established.According to a letter dated January 2, 2019, to the Ministry of Agriculture Permanent Secretary, signed by the Njeru Municipality Town Clerk, Mr Ambrose Ocen, Njeru Stock Farm has not been remitting ground rent fees for 19 years. This is to submit invoice number 631 dated January 2, 2019, in respect of Njeru Stock Farm for the last 19 years in line with the guidance from the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to Treasury in his Circular No.ISS255/432/01 dated March, 25 2015,  the letter reads, in part.When contacted on Monday, Mr Ocen, confirmed writing the letter, saying since 2000, Njeru Stock Farm management has not paid nominal ground rent equivalent to Shs100,000 per acre for 706 acres.  the terms of the sub-lease were that they [Njeru Stock Farm] would be paying Shs100,000 per acre of land per annum as nominal ground rent, unfortunately, government stopped paying that money in 2000, and the money has accumulated to Shs1.3b,  Mr Ocen said. Earlier controversiesThis comes on the heels of reports that some chunk of land housing the government demonstration farm has been parcelled out to different individuals, including Justice Minister, Kahinda Otafiire. Njeru Stock Farm, located at Bukaaya West Village, is one of the government farms under the National Animal Genetics Resources Centre & Data Bank ((NAGRC & DB). It hosts a dairy model farm.However, Dr Wilberforce Kifudde Wandera, the technical manager from the Genetics Resources Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, said the money being demanded by Njeru Municipal Council as ground rent had been inflated. It is true Njeru Municipal Council wrote to us, but it s not true that they demand all that money, they have inflated the figure to defraud government because they claim money of 1950s during the colonial time,  he said, adding  the remaining piece of land is even less because they [Njeru Municipal Council] also sub leased more land to private developers, who acquired it through fraudulent means,  he said.He also said Njeru Stock Farm has a land tittle and wondered where individuals who claim to possess titles got them from.Last year, the Justice Catherine Bamugemeire-led Commission of Inquiry into Land Matters started investigating how private individuals acquired land on the government stock farm.Ownership of the same land is currently being contested between Ham Mukasa s family and the family of the late Enock Sebowa.Ham Mukasa reportedly leased Njeru Stock Farm land measuring 1,099 acres to the colonial government for 99 years.Prior to 2000, government was paying nominal ground rent to Ham Mukasa s family through Njeru Town Council, which has since been elevated to a municipality.When contacted, Gen Kahinda Otafiire insisted that he lawfully acquired 50 acres on Plot 280 and another 50 acres on Plot 283 off the Njeru Stock Farm land. Last September, NAGRC & DB executive director, Dr Charles Lagu, told the Bamugemereire Commission that Njeru Stock Farm was on the brink of losing 504 acres to encroachers. He said the stock farm was only left with 562 acres.Investigations done by the Inspector General of Government (IGG) in 2014 revealed that although Njeru Town Council got a lease on the land in 1967, including plots 2,3,4 &5, the same town council, in 1969, sub-leased 306 acres to the Ministry of Agriculture [Njeru Stock Farm] out of Plot 2,3,4 & 5 for livestock purposes.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Njeru-Stock-Farm-land-woes-Authorities-ask-for-Shs1-3b/688334-5064220-7wbre2/index.html,/static/img/post22.png
22,Masaka residents protest new fees for grazing in forest reserves - Daily Monitor,"MASAKA. Masaka District residents have protested the revised charges levied on herders grazing their cattle in government forest reserves.The changes announced by the district forestry authorities require each cow grazed from forest reserves, including Mujuzi Forest Reserve, to pay Shs5,000, up from Shs1,000, which they have been paying monthly.However, the herdsmen have opposed the new fees, saying they are exorbitant.The most affected herdsmen are those in Diimo, Katikamu, Gayaza, Nabitaka and Byambale, among villages in Kyesiga Sub-county in Masaka District.During a crisis village meeting at Byambale Village in Kyesiiga Sub-county on Wednesday last week, the residents raised their concern over what they called exploitation by the forestry authorities.Herdsmen led by the village chairperson, Mr Baker Kalokola, claim that for long, they have been protecting the forest reserves from encroachers and land grabbers. Majority of the herdsmen here are still keeping local breeds because they don t have money to purchase and maintain hybrid heifers. So, I wonder how they will manage to pay Shs5,000 per month to feed their cattle,  he said.Also under the new arrangement, herdsmen will cease fetching firewood from the forest reserves as has been the practice.Ms Joan Namukasa, one of the affected livestock farmers, said local leaders and forestry authorities should address the problem of illegal logging in forest reserves instead of witch-hunting locals residing near forests.Livestock farmers in Bukoto Central constituency have asked their leaders, including the area legislator and Vice President Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi to intervene and ask the district forestry authorities to revise the new charges downwards.The area parish chairperson, Mr Moses Gabula, said it s unfair to charge herdsmen such money for simply grazing their cattle in forest reserves.Efforts to speak to the area forest supervisor, Mr Rogers Mwanje, were futile by press time. Grazing in forestsPermission: In the neighbouring Gomba District, National Forestry Authority permitted herders to graze in central forest reserves provided they report those who cut down trees. They are usually given a six-month grazing permit, which is renewable upon satisfactory monitoring which considers sustainable use of the reserves.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Masaka-residents-protest-new-fees-grazing-in-forest-reserves/688334-5064244-15u1qly/index.html,/static/img/post23.png
23,Security hunt poachers over  killing of nine Uganda Kobs - Daily Monitor,"NTOROKO. A combined force of Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) rangers and Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) are searching for suspected poachers believed to have killed nine kobs in Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve in Ntoroko District. The warden-in-charge of Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Mr Benon Mugyerwa, on Monday evening confirmed the death of the Uganda Kobs.  Yes, we found nine heads of the kobs inside Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve last week on Wednesday. The poachers had already taken the meat but we have dispatched a combined force of our rangers from our reserve and other parks together with the UPDF to hunt and arrest these poachers,  Mr Mugyerwa said.Other poaching incidents Just mid last month, court in Ntoroko District sentenced four cattle keepers for illegally grazing more than 600 cows in Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. Mr Deusdedit Twinomugisha, the assistant warden of Community Conservation at Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, said the cattle keepers have killed all the lions in the reserve because they eat their cows.  Lions are the key attraction to tourists in the park. Tourists don t want to see domestic animals in the park and they pay a lot of money to see wild animals, birds and boat cruise events,  he said. Mr Twinomugisha said the reserve receives between 500 to 700 tourists each year.  Last year, Police in Katwe-Kabatoro in Kasese District held four suspects for allegedly killing lions in Queen Elizabeth National Park.The 11 lions included three females and eight cubs, which died after suspected poisoning, at Hamukungu Fishing Village in Queen Elizabeth National Park.The management of the reserve continues to suffer challenges that include poaching, illegal grazing, poor road network to the reserve, poor community attitude towards conservation, illegal trafficking of wildlife resources and a high demand of resources from the reserve such as poles, firewood, water and grass.The reserveTooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve covers part of Ntoroko, Bundibugyo and Kabarole districts and also borders with Lake Albert. According to UWA, some of the cattle keepers were allowed to graze in the reserve during the ADF war to alert government about the rebel positions but after the insurgency in 1990s, however, the habit of grazing in the reserve continued. As early as 1913, Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve became significant for tsetse fly control programme and a lion hunting area.It was established as a Game Reserve in 1926 Under General Notice 546 aiming at the protection of the large population of wild animals of which kobs were dominant. Other games were reedbucks, waterbucks, hartebeests, lions, buffaloes, elephants, hippos and others.The reserve covers an area of 542sq, km. it is located in Western Uganda and is neighboured by 12 sub-counties.It is a habitat to a number of endangered species including the chimps in the central savanna and the River Line forest of Mugiri, Wasa, and Nyaburogo rivers. Tourists say the chimps here exhibit a number of unique features such as digging and drinking from holes even when water is available.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Security-hunt-poachers-over--killing-nine-Uganda-Kobs/688334-5064312-11ygt3f/index.html,/static/img/post24.png
24,"Quit if you are paid less, MP tells government teachers - Daily Monitor","NTUNGAMO. The Member of Parliament for Rushenyi County, who is also deputy Attorney General, Mr Mwesigwa Rukutana, has said teachers who are crippling the education sector over the excuse of meagre pay should quit and find other work to do.While addressing the school management committee, Parent-Teachers Association heads and teachers of Ruyonza Primary School on Monday, Mr Rukutana said he was disappointed to find out that the school has never scored good grades in Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE).He attributed the poor performance to the teachers  failure to perform their work with determination.He said government teachers should stop the tendency of complaining that they are poorly paid yet the teachers in private schools are being paid meagre salary but they are performing well. The net pay for the least paid primary school teacher in a government school is Shs420,000 per month. When I was at this school [Ruyonza Primary School] from 1967 to 1973, it was performing well but now it is a total mess,  Mr Rukutana said.Mr Rukutana is on a tour of government-aided primary and secondary schools in the constituency to assess their situation.Working togetherHe asked stakeholders to keep focused and work together to achieve better results.Ntungamo District Education Officer Arigye Odo said he would not hesitate to sack all teachers who fail to perform their duties diligently. Really we cannot tolerate this habit of continuing to perform poorly at the expense of public money, therefore, we will not hesitate to sack you if you keep doing this. Ruyonza is one of the schools that got many ungraded pupils in the district,  Mr Arigye said.The head teacher of Ruyonza Primary School, Mr Fredrick Katushabe, and other teachers pledged their commitment to work for good grades. The MP and education officials resolved to meet all parents of Ruyonza Primary School on Friday to discuss how to improve the school s performance.In the 2018 PLE, the school did not have any pupil in Division One.  There were two pupils in Division Two, 15 in Division Three, 15 in Division Four, 11 were ungraded and one was in X. It was the worst performing school in Rubaare Sub-county.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Quit-if-you-are-paid-less-MP-tells-government-teachers/688334-5064320-c2v8xvz/index.html,/static/img/post25.png
25,Dokolo patients paying to use government ambulance - Daily Monitor,"DOKOLO. Dokolo District authorities are charging residents money to use the government ambulance to transport their sick relatives to Dokolo Health Centre IV.Ms Beatrice Adongo, 34, a resident of Atabu Parish in Bata Sub-county, says she recently paid Shs80,000 to transport her expectant daughter to the health centre IV in Dokolo Town Council. The driver determines the amount of money you are supposed to pay before he comes to help you out and when you don t have the money, you can t access the ambulance,  she says. However, the in-charge of Agwata Health Centre III, Mr Roy Opio, says they always experience a big challenge with referral cases and always charge money for fuelling the vehicle.He explains that pregnant mothers seeking to use the ambulance are charged Shs20,000 when referred from Agwata health facility to Dokolo Health Centre IV, about 15kms away. Data from Agwata Health Centre III indicates that at least 50 expectant mothers visit the facility monthly. The district vice chairperson, Mr Nam Francis Ogwal, says the issue of charging patients to utilise the ambulance was brought to the attention of the district council and that it is being handled.  We are considering putting a flat rate of not more than Shs30,000 for patients to access the ambulance,  he says.Mr Eugine Odongo, the district health educator, says the district has only two ambulances. We have low budget allocation for the health department but the district has been informed that Ministry of Health is considering centralising the management of ambulances countrywide,  he says.Mr Moses Opio, a paralegal with the Uganda National Health Consumers organisation (UNHCO), says charging patients to access government ambulances deprives them their right to access quality health services.  The ambulance driver should not decide on the charges or charge patients to access the ambulance. He is a paid government worker and he is serving the taxpayers of this country,  Mr Opio says.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Dokolo-patients-paying-use-government-ambulance/688334-5064332-sw9lruz/index.html,/static/img/post26.png
26,"Women in Karamoja, West Nile to benefit from Shs33b project - Daily Monitor","The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations and the government have launched a $9 million (about Shs33.5 billion) project aimed at empowering rural women in Karamoja and West Nile sub-regions. The five-year project titled  Climate Resilient Livelihood Opportunities for Women Economic Empowerment (CRWEE) in Karamoja and West Nile regions of Uganda,  is funded by the government of Sweden through the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida). According to the donors, the funds will, among others, be directed towards strengthening gender responsive and climate change resilience of rural women, improving their access to and control of productive resources and improving their household income.Speaking at the launch of the project at Muni University yesterday, Mr Antonio Querido, the FAO county representative, said:  The frequent drought in different parts of the country negatively impacts on crop and livestock production and fuels the spread of diseases. This exerts more pressure on the already strained natural resources.  He observed that although 20 per cent of Uganda is covered by water resources, there is still limited investment in the infrastructure to capture and deliver water for domestic and agricultural production. FAO is targeting about 250 farmer groups, reaching 52,500 people as direct beneficiaries.Six out of every 10 beneficiaries will be women and girls. An additional 6,000 households will benefit from ecosystem management interventions such as tree planting, while at least 180 government officials from national and district levels, will receive training to empower them for gender-transformative climate change adaptation and mitigation.State minister for Northern Uganda Grace Kwiyucwiny said the project should be used to uplift the 9,000 households living below the poverty line in northern Uganda. Ms Kwiyucwiny said project implementers should identify locally-grown commodities such as cashew nuts, Irish potatoes, cassava, apiary and tree planting to promote value addition. The head of development cooperation at the Swedish Embassy in Uganda, Mr Ola H llgren, said there is a need to increase economic empowerment of rural women through support to production, productivity and productive employment in the agricultural sector, particularly in Karamoja and West Nile.  We recognise the need to address a number of bottlenecks such as the use of rudimentary tools and technology in production, impact of climate change and environmental degradation, lack of markets and market information, limited access and ownership of production assets for women and youths, limitations to financial access and vulnerabilities to shocks,  Mr H llgren said.West Nile and Karamoja sub-regions have peculiar challenges to rural development and poverty reduction. Compounded by the refugee influx in West Nile and recurrent long droughts and floods in Karamoja, it is hard for many households to sustain an agriculture-based livelihood.  Cultural leaders from the sub-region, including the Madi chief Stephen Drani and Alur King Phillip Olarker Rauni III, made a declaration to support women s access to more economic opportunities.Peculiar casesWest Nile and Karamoja sub-regions have peculiar challenges to rural development and poverty reduction.

27,School heads in Kinkiizi Diocese face demotion over poor grades - Daily Monitor,"Kanungu. Head teachers in Church of Uganda-founded primary schools in Kinkiizi Diocese that fail to register pupils in Division One this academic year will be demoted, Bishop Dan Zoreka has said. Non-performing head teachers will be demoted to classroom teachers because the diocese shall not tolerate them in the education department as team leaders. You either take charge and improve academic performance or go back to classroom as teachers. Work in silence and let success make noise,  Bishop Zoreka said yesterday.He was addressing head teachers, chairpersons of Parents Teachers Association and their school management committee chairpersons in Kanungu District.Statistics issued by Rev Stella Arineitwe, the education secretary of Kinkiizi Diocese, indicate that out of 2,475 pupils from 83-church founded primary schools in Kanungu that sat for Primary Leaving Examinations last year, only 123 passed in first grade.Mr Emmy Ngabirano, the deputy Resident District commissioner, said they are ready to support proposals on improving academic standards. The system of recycling and transferring head teachers that have failed to register pupils passing in grade one shall not be entertained. If you feel that you are tired, just request for early retirement and let people that are fresh and dynamic take the leadership positions you are currently occupying,  Mr Ngabirano said. How come Senior Four and Six dropouts teaching in private schools make pupils pass in grade one despite the small salaries they get and you that are being well paid by government fail to make it   he added.Ms Josephine Katsya, the district chairperson, said poor academic performance in government schools in the area is worrying.She said in the next 10 years, the district might not raise technical personnel to work in their own district because many students drop out of school before completing Senior Four.Mr Charles Sunday, the district education officer, warned head teachers against absenteeism, saying it interferes with the learning procedure. He wondered why teachers in government are not performing well. There is need for a by-law banning proprietors of private schools from taking away bright pupils in government schools after promising heaven and earth to their parents because such trends sabotage Universal Primary Education,  Mr Sunday said.Mr John Tereraho, an education consultant with World Vision, called for team work to improve academic performance.Mr Kenneth Tusingwire, the head teacher for Nyakatare Primary School, called for increase in teachers  welfare by providing them with meals and other incentives if performance is to improve. I worked at Kihiihi Primary School and the academic standards were the best in the district because parents agreed to raise extra money to motivate teachers. I am sure that if this is done, performance will improve,  Mr Tusingwire said.ConcernsOther head teachers cited absenteeism of pupils, teachers staying at one station for long, poor administrators, neglect by the foundation bodies, lack of staff accommodation and negative attitude on UPE schools by parents among others, as the major causes of poor performance. They suggested that sensitisation of all stake holders, especially being reminded of their respective roles would change the situation.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/School-heads-Kinkiizi-Diocese-face-demotion-over-poor-grades/688334-5063780-c1ln5h/index.html,/static/img/post28.png

Mr Najib Waiswa, the district police commander, identified the injured as Mr Kussein Kasaija, 42, and Mr Posoko Sekiwere, 23, all residents of Mpongo and Mukora villages, respectively.  They pointed a gun at me and asked me to give them all the money that I had. I gave them Shs.1.3 million. They proceeded to the next shop where I heard them firing bullets,   Mr Mugisha said. Eyewitnesses say the armed men attempted to rob another businesswoman but failed.Her son, Mr Sekiwere, engaged the robbers in a scuffle prompting them to shoot him, police said.

29,"Help local communities benefit from tourism, experts tell government - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government should find innovative ways of helping communities around protected areas earn from tourism if they are to appreciate and protect the parks, experts have suggested.Dr Dilys Roe, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), a London-based think-tank, said if communities feel that parks do not benefit them, they resort to poaching.She made the remarks while giving a keynote address into the threats to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and some innovative ideas for new community-based solutions in Kampala last week. The lecture was organised by Aga Khan Development Network. Citing their nearly two years  experience in helping communities around Bwindi tap into tourism, Dr Roe said many people can benefit from gorilla tracking indirectly through selling items to tourists. Gorillas are key attraction in Uganda. They are particularly important because there aren t many countries in the world where you can find gorillas. So the tourism market is here or in Rwanda,  she said.  That really sounds positive, but the other side of the story is where that money goes. Dr Roe said local communities can earn from tourism if they are trained to work as professional guides, sell food or offer authentic cultural experiences and not necessarily wait for the 10 per cent park revenue ploughed back by government. TrainingShe said IIED has already trained some residents to offer the services.Gorilla-tracking in Bwindi generates revenue for conservation, but local benefits from tourism are limited and the illegal use of the park s resources continues.Tourism is a top foreign exchange earner and Uganda last year raked in $1.4b (Shs5 trillion) from the sector, according to government statistics.Mr Amin Mawji, the Aga Khan Development Network representative in Uganda, said the lectures are aimed at creating  a space for conversation... a space for illumination where leaders and opinion formers can come together to reflect on the big issues of our time, to explore new ideas and fresh perspectives, and to promote new solutions to the problems that face us and our children. The lecture examined some of the challenges facing the tourism sector. Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, the Tourism minister, lauded the Aga Khan Development Network for organising the lecture and contributing to the development of Uganda.He said government is committed to conserving the environment but sometimes they are let down by rampant poverty among Ugandans, bad attitude and the growing population of people and animals that compete for space.The lecture was attended by Mr Daudi Migereko, the chairman of Uganda Tourist Board, several ambassadors and senior leadership of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Help-local-communities-benefit-from-tourism-experts-tell-govt/688334-5063750-gaoykg/index.html,/static/img/post30.png

The processes of compensation and resettlement would be spear -headed by the Office of the Prime Minister, Lands ministry and Minister for Northern Uganda, Ms Grace Kwiyucwiny.The affected residents, however, say they will not accept any form of compensation and forceful plans to evict them from their ancestral land.Mr Sylvester Odoki, a resident of Acholi Ber Parish, says he totally disagrees with government plans to force them into accepting money and material benefits.Mr Denis Komakech, another Apaa resident, says the recent Cabinet memorandum was wrong on disclosing that only 374 families occupy Apaa land.Documents presented before Cabinet in February seen by this newspaper titled  The memorandum of Efforts to resolve the Apaa land conflict  indicated that 374 families occupy the land. A total of 206 were found to be non-violent and cooperative with government. According to the document, only 71 family heads were found with national IDs as residents of Apaa Village, Labala parish, Pabbo Sub-county in Amuru between 2013 and 2014 before the 2017 declaration of the boundary.However according to Mr Komakech, the information provided is inaccurate adding that more than 20,000 people are settling on the land.Last month, the Acholi legislators under their Umbrella body, the Acholi Parliamentary Group (APG), rejected the compensation plans.Mr Philip Okin Ojara, the APG chairperson, said the amount offered by government is too little for the residents to lose their land. Dr Daniel Komakech, the Acholi committee chairperson on Apaa land conflict, said the Cabinet resolution was made without consent from the team selected to ensure a peaceful resolution.Speaking during a meeting to discuss solutions on land conflict in Amuru and Nwoya districts at the Ker Kwaro Acholi Palace in Gulu Town on Thursday, Mr Komakech said the cabinet resolution was different from what they had discussed with the Prime Minister.In August last year, President Museveni called for the formation of an eight member committee from both Adjumani and Acholi to discuss the recommendations on ending the Apaa land impasse. The committee was headed by the Prime Minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda.However, in two meetings held between September and December last year and chaired by Dr Rugunda, the parties failed to harmonise on Mr Museveni s earlier recommendations.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Apaa-Land-Residents-reject-resettlement-compensation/688334-5062492-um0t30z/index.html,/static/img/post31.png
31,"Government, donors partner to restore wetlands - Daily Monitor","KABALE. The Ministry of Water and Environment with support from the World Bank Adaptation Fund through Sahara Sahel Observatory, a non-governmental organisation, has started a five-year project aimed at restoring wetlands in Maziba, Awoja and River Aswa catchment areas.Maziba catchment extends to Rubanda, Kabale, Rukiga and Ntungamo districts. Aswa stretches to districts of Kaabong, Kotido, Kitgum, Agago, Abim, Pader, Lira, Amuria, Otuke, Aleptong, Napak and Abim while Ajowa extends to Bukwo, Kween, Nakapiripiriti, Katakwi, Kumi, Serere, Soroti and Ngora districts.These three water catchment areas are alleged to have lost more than 70 per cent of the wetlands due to human intervention. While addressing the stakeholders in a meeting on Friday, Ms Annette Kezia Nantongo, a senior water officer with the Ministry of Water and Environment, said $7.75 million (about Shs29b) will be spent on the project.Ms Nantongo, who is also the project officer, said the drive aims at increasing the resilience of the surrounding communities to the risk of floods and landslides through promoting catchment based integrated, equitable and sustainable management of water and related resources. All these areas that we are targeting are prone to floods. People have depleted wetlands and the effects are visible. They are at a high risk of losing all the water resources in the area as well as facing desertification if the water catchments are invaded like they are now,  Ms Nantongo said.CoverageAwoja catchment covers 11,000 square kilometres; Aswa catchment covers 27,631 square kilometres while Maziba catchment covers 1,370 square kilometres.The project officials met district leaders, media and civil society organisations in Kabale to agree on the modalities of implementing the project in the region. District leaders, however, expressed concern that the project has up-bottom approach which may limit the impact.Kabale LC5 Patrick Besigye Kaihwa said while ministries come up with well written projects, they end up not being implemented because they lack local content. He said locals should be involved in all the processes. We want a project that shall have impact, many projects the ministries bring to us are designed and executed from the centre therefore lacking local content, the reason they at times fail. We now need to get fully involved and help our people because they are the ones affected by climate change in the end,  Mr Kaihwa said.The Ntungamo LC5 chairman, Mr Denis Singahache, who is also the chairperson of the Maziba catchment, asked the leaders in the area to embrace any project that comes to address climate change because it is negatively affecting their livelihood.Background 2013. Majority of the wetlands in Kabale District were degraded and turned into gardens and dairy farms, an official said.The then district wetlands coordinator, Mr Joseph Murangira, said the increasing population triggered the high demand for farming land.He added that soil exhaustion on hill tops and the recent introduction of tea growing in the district had escalated the situation. He said less than five wetlands out of the 72 that existed in 1980s that were in existence, adding that plans were underway to evict the encroachers.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-donors-partner-restore-wetlands/688334-5062532-132cc20/index.html,/static/img/post32.png
32,"Uganda, DR Congo unite to fight illegal wildlife trade - Daily Monitor","KABAROLE. In a bid to fight illegal wildlife trade and trafficking in Queen Elizabeth and Virunga national parks, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through their wildlife authority bodies have embarked on trans-boundary collaboration to curb the vice.The wildlife authorities in Uganda include International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in partnership with the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA).IFAW is an international non-governmental organisation that protects animals and their habitants. The UWA deputy executive director, Mr George Owoyesigire, said Uganda is endowed with diverse natural resources such as wildlife, forests and wetlands, but poaching, illegal wildlife trade and habitat degradation remain threats. We have seen a serious decline in wildlife populations due to poaching and illegal wildlife trade,  he said.Mr Owoyesigire said this on Saturday at Koikoi in Fort Portal Town during a training of security and law enforcement officers within Queen Elizabeth and Virunga national parks on how to detect and combat illegal wildlife trade.He said due to the efforts, UWA with support from stakeholders are beginning to witness an increase in wild animals. For instance, elephant population decreased from 30,000 in 1960 to only 2,000 by 1983 and have since increased to 5,808 in 2017; buffalos were 60,000 in 1960 decreased to 25,000 in 1982 but have since increased to 37,054,  he said.Mr Owoyesigire said deforestation has had devastating effects on the forest cover from more than 30 per cent in 1990 to less than 9 per cent by 2019, wetland cover from more than 40 per cent in 1980 to less than 8 per cent by 2018. As a result of degradation, wild life in habitats have been destroyed, lakes have been depleted and that s the very reason we are experiencing an increase in human-wildlife conflicts, poverty and poaching as people strive to earn a living,  he said.The programmes director of IFAW, Mr Moses Olinga, said collaborating with the neighbouring country (DRC) will help in combating illegal wildlife trade easily.He said:  When animals cross from Uganda to DRC, they are killed because it is unknown where they belong. The border between Uganda and DRC has been used by poachers, and they have been killing animals from Uganda and they take them to DRC and vice versa.  He said pangolins have been the most poached animals because of their medicinal scales and therefore there is need for security agencies to get skills on how to identify scales of pangolins, skins of leopards, cheetahs, among others. People trying to smuggle chimps and other animals have been arrested at Entebbe, Jomo Kenyatta and Addis Ababa international airports  he added.Kabarole Resident District Commissioner Stephen Asiimwe appealed to UWA officials and other stakeholders to also domesticate laws such as the Wildlife Act and the constitution [explain the laws in local languages] because people are not informed.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Uganda-DR-Congo-unite-fight-illegal-wildlife-trade/688334-5062586-etnycb/index.html,/static/img/post33.png
33,Councillors raise queries over sold hospital equipment - Daily Monitor,"Kayunga. Councillors in Kayunga District have put the district executive committee on the spot over failure to show accountability of funds raised from the sale of old medical equipment at Kayunga General Hospital.The hospital is undergoing renovation and expansion at a cost of Shs70b. Dr Diana Atwine, the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Health, said the facility will be equipped with new machines upon completion.Although the council claims that they have not been informed about the funds raised, Mr Tom Sserwanga, the district chairperson, said about Shs210m has been collected from the exercise.Mr Jamir Ndugga, a councillor representing Kayonza Sub-county, said the district executive has utilised the funds without their approval. As council, we have not yet passed a supplementary budget to appropriate those funds, but we are shocked to learn that the executive has used it,  Mr Ndugga said at the weekend. When they wanted to sell off the medical equipment, they sought council approval, but when it comes to accountability, they dodge around, it means there is misappropriation and corruption tendencies,  he added.Some officials are also questioning the motive of the district executive to constitute another committee to handle the auctioning instead of the procurement and disposal unit. We were left out of this exercise (sale of equipment) and we are also watching from a distance,  an official from the procurement department, who preferred anonymity, said.Mr Sserwanga set up a verification team headed by Mr Charles Iga, the district fisheries officer, to dispose of the equipment.Mr Sserwanga categorised the funds from the sale as local revenue, saying they can be used in daily operations. The Shs210m is very little. We have so far used Shs42m to roof the theatre at Bbaale Health Centre IV. We wanted to do something tangible from these funds,  he said.Mr Sserwanga said they would show accountability to relevant authorities such as the Auditor General and Inspectorate of Government, adding that  we want to be as transparent as possible. Mr Benson Otim, the acting district chief administrative officer, also dismissed claims that the money had been misappropriated. Council has approved these funds to be used in fencing the district headquarters, buying furniture for the district chairperson and others,  Mr Otim said.He said the exercise is still ongoing and those who want accountability should wait for it to be concluded.Kayunga General Hospital, which was constructed in the 1970s, had never had any major renovations.Dr Sarah Opendi, the State minister for Health in-charge of General Duties, said government will delay the elevation of the hospital to a regional referral due to lack of funds. SoldSo far, the district has sold more than 700 aluminium iron sheets, hospital beds, mattresses and other equipment from the theatre among others. The renovation and expansion of the hospital is expected to be concluded by February next year.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Councillors-raise-queries-over-sold-hospital-equipment/688334-5062598-ijid1i/index.html,/static/img/post34.png
34,Battle for Tripoli escalates as UN meets over crisis - Daily Monitor,"The battle for Libya's capital intensified as the UN Security Council met Wednesday to discuss the crisis gripping the North African country, where armed rivals are locked in a deadly power struggle.The closed-door talks in New York come a day after the United Nations postponed a Libyan national conference aimed at drawing up an election roadmap because of fighting raging on Tripoli's doorstep.Libya has been riven by divisions since the NATO-backed overthrow of dictator Muammer Gadhafi in 2011, with various armed groups and two parallel governments vying for territory and oil wealth.Heavy clashes were heard Wednesday in the Ain Zara district on the southeastern outskirts of Tripoli as military strongman Khalifa Haftar's forces pressed an assault aimed at taking the capital from the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA).""The clashes have intensified. We're afraid to leave the house,"" a resident told AFP by telephone from the area, where roads were reported to have been blocked, hindering people's efforts to flee.The violence has already displaced thousands and left several dozen people dead.The Libyan Red Crescent said it had evacuated civilians on Wednesday morning but had so far only had access to combat zones controlled by the GNA.Led by Fayez al-Sarraj, the GNA's authority is not recognised by a parallel administration in the east of the country, which is allied with Haftar.Thirty families were evacuated from Ain Zara and Wadi Rabi, a district further south, to reception centres or to homes of relatives and friends, the Red Crescent said on its Facebook page.The UN Security Council began meeting behind closed doors to consider next steps, with diplomats saying Britain was discussing a possible draft resolution.""We agree with the secretary-general that there should be a ceasefire but at the moment we do not have a text,"" British Ambassador Karen Pierce told reporters ahead of the talks.Cat and mouseHaftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls swathes of the country's east, said it had seized a barracks in the Aziziya area around 50 kilometres (31 miles) south of Tripoli after ""ferocious clashes"".It said several fighters loyal to the UN-backed government had been detained and their weapons seized.""For the moment, it's still a game of cat and mouse,"" said a commander from a pro-GNA group.""We're still organising ourselves. The war hasn't truly started,"" he told AFP.The internationally recognised government carried out several air raids against LNA positions south of Tripoli, and also hit supply lines in central Libya, GNA spokesman Colonel Mohamed Gnounou said Tuesday.Haftar's forces appear to be advancing on two fronts, from the south and southeast of Tripoli, while coastal roads to the east and west of the city are defended by fighters loyal to the GNA.Children at risk Haftar has defied international calls to halt the surprise offensive launched on Thursday.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was ""deeply concerned by the situation in Libya.""""The current military operation and advance on Tripoli are increasing the suffering of the Libyan people and putting civilian lives at risk,"" he said in a statement.The UN children's agency (UNICEF) said ""nearly half a million children in Tripoli and tens of thousands more in the western areas are at a direct risk due to the intensification of fighting"".The GNA's health ministry on Monday put the death toll in the fighting at 35. Haftar's forces have said 14 of their fighters have died.The UN said the clashes have displaced some 3,400 people.Although casualties remain limited so far, the International Crisis Group warned further escalation ""could precipitate a humanitarian disaster"".""If unleashed, a full-fledged offensive could become a proxy war between regional powers and cause innumerable casualties as well as immense devastation,"" it said in a report Wednesday.Peace efforts stalled International efforts to end the Libyan conflict have repeatedly failed.Rival leaders agreed last year to hold elections before December 10, 2018 under a French plan, but that vote never materialised. The national conference, which had been scheduled for April 14-16 in the central city of Ghadames, aimed to fix dates for legislative and presidential elections, and work towards a new constitution.UN envoy Ghassan Salame, announcing its postponement, said: ""We cannot ask people to take part in the conference during gunfire and air strikes.""He expressed hope the meeting would take place ""as soon as possible"".Haftar, whose key allies are the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Russia, is a former Kadhafi military chief who has emerged as a major player in Libya's political struggle. His offensive threatens to plunge the country into a full-blown civil war and has thrown into sharp relief the divisions between world powers over how to end the chaos that has riven Libya since 2011.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/-Tripoli-UN-NATO-Muammer-Gadhafi-Wadi-Rabi-Egypt/688340-5066152-u75vqsz/index.html,/static/img/post35.png
35,Netanyahu on path for victory in Israeli election - Daily Monitor,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on path for victory in Israel's elections on Wednesday after nearly complete results put him in position to form a right-wing coalition and further extend his long tenure in office.The results from Tuesday's vote came despite corruption allegations against the 69-year-old premier and put him on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister later this year.His Likud party looked set to finish with a similar number of seats in parliament to his main rival, ex-military chief Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White alliance, Israeli media reported.But with 97 percent of the vote counted, results showed the Likud and other right-wing parties allied to him with some 65 seats in the 120-seat parliament, the reports said.The result would seem to leave President Reuven Rivlin, whose task it is to ask one of the candidates to form a government, with little choice but to pick Netanyahu.Intensive coalition negotiations are likely to follow and could drag on for days or even weeks.Final results were expected by Thursday afternoon, with ballots for soldiers and other special categories of voters yet to be counted.The close race between the two main parties had led to uncertainty after polls closed on Tuesday night and exit surveys were released.- 'Magnificent victory' -Both Netanyahu and Gantz claimed victory after the initial exit surveys that gave Blue and White the most seats.But even then Netanyahu appeared best placed to form a coalition, with both parties in any case falling far short of an outright majority.Netanyahu spoke in the early hours of Wednesday at the Likud's post-election party in Tel Aviv and called it a ""magnificent victory.""As he walked onto the stage to chanting crowds, he planted a kiss on the lips of his wife Sara.""It will be a right-wing government, but I will be prime minister for all,"" he said.Earlier while addressing cheering supporters who waived Israeli flags at an event hall in Tel Aviv, Gantz called it a ""historic day.""""The president must give us the task of forming the next government since we are the biggest party,"" he said after initial exit polls.The vote had long been expected to be close and lead to frantic negotiations to form a coalition, even with Netanyahu facing potential corruption charges.Fighting for his political life, Netanyahu spent the weeks ahead of the vote campaigning furiously to energise his right-wing base.Things can changeGantz, a newcomer to politics, mounted a strong challenge to the veteran prime minister by brandishing his security credentials while pledging to undo damage he says Netanyahu has inflicted on the country with divisive politics.The election was in many ways a referendum on the premier who has built a reputation as guarantor of the country's security and economic growth, but whose populism and alleged corruption left many ready for change.He engaged in populist rhetoric that critics said amounted to the demonisation of Arab Israelis and others.Netanyahu faced further criticism on election day when members of his Likud party brought small cameras into polling stations in Arab areas.Arab politicians called it an attempt at intimidation, while Netanyahu said cameras would prevent fraud.True to form, Netanyahu issued a deeply controversial pledge only three days before the election, saying he planned to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should he win.Extending Israeli sovereignty on a large scale in the West Bank could be the death knell to already fading hopes for a two-state solution with the Palestinians.It is a move long championed by Israel's far right.King Bibi Netanyahu sought to portray himself as Israel's essential statesman in the run-up to the vote and highlighted his bond with US President Donald Trump.He spoke of Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and of Israel's claim of sovereignty over the annexed Golan Heights.He also used Trump-like tactics, calling the corruption investigations a ""witch hunt"" and denouncing journalists covering them.On Tuesday, he continually warned the Likud was at risk of losing as a result of what he said was low turnout among supporters, claims widely seen as a bid to motivate right-wing voters.Turnout was 67.9 percent compared to 71.8 percent in the last election in 2015.Gantz, a 59-year-old former paratrooper, invoked the corruption allegations against the premier to make his case that it is time for him to go.He called Netanyahu's annexation pledge an ""irresponsible"" bid for votes.Gantz said he favoured a ""globally backed peace agreement"" with Israel holding on to the large West Bank settlement blocs, adding that he opposed unilateral moves.He sought to overcome Netanyahu's experience by allying with two other former military chiefs and ex-finance minister Yair Lapid to form his alliance.Netanyahu has been premier for a total of more than 13 years.But ""King Bibi,"" as some have called him, now faces the prospect of becoming the first sitting prime minister to be indicted.The attorney general has announced he intends to indict Netanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust pending an upcoming hearing.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Netanyahu-victory-Benny-Gantzs-Israeli-election-Israeli/688340-5064858-12ngqwx/index.html,/static/img/post36.png

The election of upper house speaker Abdelkader Bensalah as interim president follows constitutional rules but goes against the demands of demonstrators, who have pushed for him and other top politicians to stand down.""I want to work towards fulfilling the interests of the people,"" Bensalah, a trusted ally of Bouteflika, told parliament on taking up the 90-day interim presidency.""It's a great responsibility that the constitution demands of me,"" the 77-year-old added.Opposition parties refused to back the appointment of the seasoned establishment insider and boycotted the session, as thousands of students protested against him in Algiers.""Resign Bensalah!"" they chanted, clutching hand-written placards and Algerian flags.For the first time in seven weeks police in the capital fired tear gas to try to disperse the protest by students, who were also hit with water cannon.On Friday -- in the first weekly mass protest since Bouteflika announced his departure after losing the military's support -- Algerians demanded regime insiders be excluded from the political transition.Ahead of the parliamentary session, an editorial in pro-government daily El Moudjahid on Tuesday suggested Bensalah should step aside from the presidential post.He is ""not tolerated by the citizen movement, which demands his immediate departure,"" or by the opposition and various political groups in both houses of parliament, the newspaper said.- 'Voice of the people' -Three men in particular have drawn demonstrators' ire: Bensalah, the head of the constitutional council Tayeb Belaiz and prime minister Noureddine Bedoui.The protest movement is calling for a new transitional framework that is committed to deep reforms and organising free elections.Ahead of Bensalah's appointment, calls continued for the speaker to step down.""He has to resign, it's the voice of the people and the people must be right,"" said 50-year-old Mourad, an entrepreneur who will protest Friday with his two young daughters.""They don't know that there's democracy... I want to teach them what freedom is,"" he added.Algerians of all ages have rallied since late February against Bouteflika, who resigned a week ago after efforts to appease demonstrators proved fruitless.Although the 82-year-old's resignation was celebrated by protesters, they have remained firm in pushing for a wider overhaul of the political system.Human Rights Watch said Bouteflika's departure is ""at most a first step in ending autocratic rule.""""During any transitional phase, authorities should fully respect the rights of Algerians to speak, assemble and associate with one another,"" the watchdog said in a statement.Demonstrators in huge numbers have defied a protest ban in Algiers, and HRW on Tuesday called on authorities to overhaul laws ""on association and assembly that stifle rights.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Bouteflika-ally-named-Algeria-s-first-new-president-20-years/688340-5063880-euwet5/index.html,/static/img/post37.png

Since the protests erupted in December, the armed forces have remained on the sidelines even as security agents and riot police have cracked down.Demonstrators have called on the army to protect them from the deadly crackdown, after days of camping outside its headquarters, which also houses Bashir's residence and the defence ministry.Wish of the revolutionDefence Minister General Awad Ibnouf vowed that the army would prevent any slide into chaos.""Sudan's armed forces understand the reasons for the demonstrations and is not against the demands and aspirations of the citizens, but it will not allow the country to fall into chaos,"" Ibnouf said on Monday, according to the official SUNA news agency.In a separate statement, army chief of staff Kamal Abdelmarouf said the military was ""discharging its responsibility in securing and protecting citizens.""Officials say 38 people have died in protest-related violence since December.Interior Minister Bushara Juma said seven protesters died and 15 were wounded on Saturday when forces tried to disperse them.He said 42 security personnel were injured and 2,496 arrests made.The umbrella group spearheading the protests appealed to the army on Monday for talks on forming a transitional government.""We call on the Sudanese armed forces to talk directly with the Alliance for Freedom and Change for facilitating the peaceful process of forming a transitional government,"" said Omar el-Digeir, a senior member of the group.Digeir said the protest organisers had formed a council to open talks aimed at agreeing a ""transitional government that represents the wish of the revolution"".Reading from a statement, he also called on the armed forces ""to withdraw their support for a regime that has lost its legitimacy"" and to support the ""people's alternative for a transition to a civilian democratic government"".Economic mismanagement The rally outside the army headquarters has been the largest since protests began on December 19 in the central town of Atbara, quickly spreading to the capital and nationwide.The European Union said an ""unprecedented"" number of people had come out calling for change since Saturday.""The people of Sudan have shown remarkable resilience in the face of extraordinary obstacles over many years,"" the EU's External Action Service said.""Their trust must be won through concrete action by the government.""The protesters accuse Bashir's administration of economic mismanagement that has led to soaring food prices and chronic shortages of fuel and foreign currency.After a meeting chaired by Bashir on Sunday, Sudan's security council said the demands of the protesters ""have to be heard"".Bashir, wanted by the Hague-based International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide connected with the suppression of a now 16-year-old ethnic minority rebellion in the western region of Darfur, took power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.He has remained defiant, introducing tough measures that have seen protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists arrested.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Gun-fire-army-headquaters-Sudan-Omar-alBashir-protestors/688340-5063414-uk3vehz/index.html,/static/img/post39.png

He remains one of the longest serving presidents in Africa.On Tuesday, security agents had to abort attempts to disperse the crowds when soldiers countered their volleys of tear gas by firing in the air, witnesses said.NISS said it was ""monitoring the demonstrations and discharging its duty according to law"".Troops stationed Sudan's police has ordered its forces not to intervene against protesters.""We call on God to preserve the security and calm of our country... and to unite the Sudanese people... for an agreement which would support the peaceful transition of power,"" it said in a statement.On Wednesday, protesters were raising funds to ensure a regular supply of food and water for the crowd.""Many shop owners and businessmen have offered us free supplies,"" said one demonstrator.Protesters have set up five big screens at the complex to screen football matches, an onlooker said.Witnesses said troops stationed vehicles mounted with machine-guns at the gates of the complex.The SPA said ""several members and leaders"" of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF) had given indications they would join the movement.The RSF is made up of Arab militias that fought on the side of government forces against rebels in Sudan's western region of Darfur in the initial years of the conflict.Bashir's ruling National Congress Party said plans to hold a rally backing the president on Thursday had been postponed.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Sudan-army-state-media-Khartoum-Omar-alBashir/688340-5066186-13ivbglz/index.html,/static/img/post40.png
40,Dedicated to pupils with special needs - Daily Monitor,"Maria Nansubuga Galiwango was supposed to be a journalist. That is what she longed for as a child. She thought that each of her days would be filled with an adventure of travelling to new places.Instead, after completing Senior Four, her elder brother encouraged her to become a teacher because of her love for children. That was the turning point as Nansubuga joined Gaba Teachers College where she graduated with a certificate in primary school teaching. It was the beginning of the journey into the unknown. She got a job at a school that she never thought would change her life forever.Tough startIn 2012, Nansubuga joined Hill Preparatory School, Naguru, kickstarting her journey in teaching.  I was given an inclusion class but that was a big challenge,  the 32-year-old said.An inclusive class has learners with disabilities and special education learning alongside their non-disabled peers. I had no interest at first. I was even afraid but after prayer I realised that this was a special group of people God had allowed me to reach,  Nansubuga recalls.As we sat for the interview, the love from the children was evident. A couple of them played with her while some hugged her, interrupting the session at several stages.Getting into the grooveA multi-talented teacher, Nansubuga later completed her diploma at Uganda Martyrs University-Nkozi in 2015 courtesy of the school director Clare Wavamunno and head teacher Ambrose Kibuuka. She attended several school trainings at Lugogo in Kampala which were regularly organised by Special Olympics Uganda as well as Umoja Global Community Music Therapy. The British Council also offered her an opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom in 2014 during an exchange programme to improve her skills of teaching special needs children.  I picked interest in furthering my knowledge of special needs education because I found these children amazing. They are so loving and I started seeing Jesus in them,  she said.Another dimensionNansubuga who teaches English and Mathematics, currently conducts private lessons at the convenience of the parents  homes for the last one year.Although she left Hill last year, she still goes there to conduct swimming lessons on a private arrangement.Nansubuga said she is now married to teaching even though she opted to start her private classes which she says offered her greener pastures. There are some parents who are still not comfortable bringing their special needs children in public and I find that an opportunity to reach out to them and help them develop,  she said.Nansubuga said she chose that approach because it is exciting yet she has a passion for seeing children with special needs excel. For special needs children, there s something new everyday, she says. They are fun and can be a challenge sometimes especially children with intellectual disabilities but we get to know each other. Nansubuga believes a good special needs educator is someone who has a passion for what they teach, and who you teach.  Being flexible and passionate is something I take pride in as an educator. I constantly talk to them to be able to build self-esteem. She was forced into swimming to tame autistic children who are normally hyper, especially after lunch making it necessary to curb extra energy.The common intellectual disability cases she has handled include; autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Each of those cases are handled differently and that is the best lesson I have learned in life. Everyone is different from the other,  she notes, adding that loving such children is what makes us human.Moving onNansubuga agrees that she cannot get all the money she needs from teaching as such she handles different projects. After opting to leave Hill Preparatory School last year, she joined Kampala International Pre-School in Naguru before she settled at Bourneville International School. She supplements this by working in a network marketing company, Success, which deals in cryptocurrencies. I do personal work with Success online and I never have to worry about my teaching appointments,  she says about her balancing act.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Dedicated-pupils-with-special-needs/688336-5060824-glwrmwz/index.html,/static/img/post41.png
41,NTCs should offer computer courses - Daily Monitor,"Despite computer being one of the subjects taught in schools today, several National Teacher s College (NTCs) across the country do not conduct these courses for their students. As such several stakeholders in the education sector have called on the Education ministry to consider having in place computer courses to produce teachers who can impart computer education to the learners. Last year, National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), recommended that computer studies must be taught at both O and A-Level.In fact Denis Tabo, a former student of Gulu Central High School told Daily Monitor that limited access to computer labs, and lack of computer books was the reason why students performed dismally in computer exams in the 2018-2019 national exams. We used to access computer lab twice a week for only 80 minutes a day which is not enough for a student to practice,   he said. He also cited lack of computer books that has made most of the students fail the theory part of the computer exams due to limited books in various schools. But Michael Okidi, the head teacher Layibi High School, advised schools to take up computer lessons when they already have in place enough computers and well-trained computer teachers. Lack of professional teachers is forcing us to hire anybody with a Bachelors in Computer Science some of whom are not equipped with the right knowledge of teaching students,  he said. Charles Nyakito, the principal Unyama NTC, said computer studies are not yet in their curriculum.  We have been advocating for Kyambogo University to substitute Typewriting course with computer studies but we are not yet successful,  Nyakito said. Currently, only Business Education students at Unyama NTC are taught computer, which is a small group,  he adds.Decrying the status quo, Ronald Lukyamuzi, the vice chairman Information and Communication Technology Teachers Association of Uganda, said most of the members of the association are not professional teachers but university ICT and Computer Science graduates.  Government should also equip all the schools teaching computer studies with computers. Most schools have only about five computers which are shared by 60 students and no projector to support teachers in class,  he said. Computer studies were included in secondary school syllabus to encourage practical work and skills to allow students to accommodate the changing technologies in ICT.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/NTCs-should-offer-computer-courses/688336-5060874-jfktjhz/index.html,/static/img/post42.png
42,"I do not regret becoming a teacher, despite poor pay - Daily Monitor","Teachers complain about little pay and in fact this has discouraged a number of people from joining the profession. Not for Joviah Nyakwera. The teacher is proud of her choice of profession. Nyakwera describes her 12-year experience in teaching as an amazing journey, which she would love to end only on retirement. A number of teachers are in the profession but do not like their work. I am grateful for what I am. Through teaching I have been exposed to people from different walks of life and I have been able to influence their lives positively,  she says. Born to Yofesi Ndoleriire of Rubona Bunyangabu, Nyakwera says she was inspired to join the profession by her parents who were both teachers.She recalls being taught while at home something she attributes her love for teaching to.  I always spare time to revise with my children. This helps me discover their strengths but also weaknesses in learning,  she says.Nyakwera joined school in 1989 at Rubona Primary School and after completing Primary Seven, she joined Kahinju Secondary School in Fort Portal for O-Level.While at Kahinju, she was drawn further to teaching after seeing the commitment and selfless attitude that her teachers displayed. My teachers were a great inspiration. Some would even sacrifice their leisure time just to give us extra lessons on hard concepts which we would not have grasped during lessons,  she says adding that this selfless attitude is what has made some teachers influential people.In 2000, Nyakwera joined Progressive Secondary School, Wandegeya for A-Level with History, Economics, Geography and Divinity as her subject combination.She later enrolled for a Bachelors of Arts in Education at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. This was a dream come true considering she was enrolling for a course that she had longed to pursue.In 2004, after her graduation, Nyakwera started her teaching journey at Kaboyo Secondary School in Kabarole District. She was not employed on fulltime basis but it did not stop her from doing her job well.  I used to wake up early in the morning and be at school on time regardless of the little pay I was getting,  she recalls. In all this, her joy was seeing her students excel and move on to the next level. Diversifying She was at Kaboyo until 2010 when she was transferred to Kibiito Senior Secondary School to teach History and Divinity in Senior Four and Senior Six.She wanted to diversify. And so she applied to become an examiner for Senior Four History at Uneb in 2009. This is a decision Nyakwera does not regret. She says becoming an examiner has helped her learn many ideas thus helping her get more students to pass her subject.  I have learnt how they mark at Uneb and what they consider during marking,  she notes. In 2012, Nyakwera was transferred to Nyarukoma Secondary School in Kyenjonjo District as a teacher on government payroll. She was there for two years until the administration of Kibiito Secondary School asked for her services again. In 2014, she returned to Kibiito Secondary School but alongside teaching, she became the senior woman. This, she says, made her realise that students have several issues that teachers need to address so that they are nurtured and attain a holistic education. Students have so many issues that affect their daily lives. They range from physical, social to physiological. If not addressed, it becomes hard for the students to perform well. Important to note is that as teachers, we have a big role to play in these student s lives since we spend a lot of time with them, compared to their parents,  she explains.Growing careerNyakwera is now the deputy head teacher in charge of general duties at the school. Despite teaching the candidate classes, she spares time to interact with the students and through this, she finds out the major challenges that are affecting students and finds possible ways to solve them. To get expertise on this, Nyakwera has enrolled for a Masters in Counselling Psychology at Uganda Martyrs University, Nkozi. To her, a good teacher is supposed to provide counselling and guidance to the students.Asked about some of the challenges affecting the teaching profession, Nyakwera says the greatest is teachers who join the profession as the last option, as well as businessmen who open schools and have led to unhealthy competition among schools. These business people are not interested in the kind of students their school churns out. They are only interested in instant results so as to attract more numbers in their schools. This has led to high level of malpractices in schools,  she observes.Nyakwera says for a teacher to excel in teaching, they need to be selfless, patient, hardworking and committed. And athough the salary may not be that much, she say there is nothing as gratifying as a teacher seeing their students excelling in future.Voices Nyakwera is a teacher that is very determined to get results. She is good at engaging parents so as to make sure that her students get help both at home and at school. Gwendolyn Kanyomozi, teacher She is self-driven and patient with her students. She is also a good counsellor who always engages students to make sure they are on the right track. Moses Rubalema, lecturer, Mountains of the Moon University She is strict and does not tolerate laziness. But it is her being strict that has modelled me into what I am today. She does not want to see any of her students fail. Jonathan Mwesige, student, Makerere University",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/I-do-not-regret-becoming-a-teacher-/688336-5050658-13lm3f7z/index.html,/static/img/post43.png
43,Ensure you enrol for a course you won t regret - Daily Monitor,"In 2016, Makerere University students protested the institution s decision to scrap 32 courses. The affected students complained that the decision would affect their chances at gainful employment in the competitive job market. Commenting on the institution s decision, Prof John Ddumba Ssentamu, the vice chancellor of Makerere University then, said some of the courses were merged, dropped totally or restructured to give holistic training to students. He added that students must understand that curriculums are always reviewed. And while Makerere was restructuring courses, in Mukono at Uganda Christian University, some new courses were being introduced. According to Ivan Naijuka, the university spokesperson at the time, the decision to review their curriculum to include new courses was because the institution aims at giving their graduates a competitive advantage in the job market.  The need to train professionals who are whole in the sense of knowledge, integrity as well as stewardship directed the institution s decision to include new courses,  he said. But with the various changes in courses of study at our institutions, what should inform one s choice  PassionSolomon Eriatu, a former student at Kampala International University, says he had always been passionate about journalism and when it was time for him to join university, he could not look any further than a course which would offer him the much desired training. And so Eriatu enrolled for Mass Communication.  I am an extrovert and sociable person and basing on those character traits and my passion for news reporting, I decided to join journalism class. My role models are all media people and I had been practising how to write stories since primary school.  Similarly, Judith Akwelele enrolled for a Bachelors in Child Development because of her love for children.  I could not have opted for any other course as my passion for children in unrivalled. And contrary to popular belief, I had high grades that are synonymous with those who enrol for courses such as Law. At least I felt happier than my colleagues doing Law because they were influenced by their parents,  she says. InspirationOften times, students envision a conducive and favourable working environment ready to embrace them after university through the eyes of their role models. Sean Rukundo, a graduate of Procurement and Logistics, currently a CIPS student at Uganda Management Institute, says he was inspired to study procurement and logistics because of his father s success.  Having seen my father move through the ranks in a government ministry s department of procurement, I was inspired to pursue the same course. I envisioned a job market in favour of procurement officers. Unfortunately, times are dynamic and I have not been able to find a stable,  narrates Rukundo. Money factorDespite her passion for Law, 43-year-old Mary Ouma, enrolled for Bachelor of Arts in Education because she was getting government sponsorship on the latter at Makerere University.  The high tuition fees for law school left me with no option but to venture into teaching. Fortunately, I have grown to love the profession. And luckily the job market is very favourable for my kind even with the changing times,  she says. GradesAlthough some are driven by passion, others are forced to choose certain courses by their scores in national examinations. For instance Martin Kaganzi s dream of joining journalism class still remains a dream.  I was given Public Administration at Kyambogo University as my 14 points at UACE could not allow for Journalism,  he shares. Some students opt for certain courses after getting intimidated out of the ones they have been admitted to. Most universities give students a window of two weeks to if they are to switch. Akwelele reveals that some of her peers joined Child Development course because they thought it would be easier for them to pass and be free from retaking papers. Similarly Sheila Alupot, a third year student of Nkumba University switched from Mass Communication to Bachelors of Social Work and Social Administration after feeling overwhelmed.  The multiple theories and numerous fieldwork assignments in the Journalism class scared me,  she says. According to Doreen Metta, a lecturer at St Lawrence University, students need to get career guidance.  Students who receive career guidance are well equipped with the knowledge of which courses to study.  Metta encourages both teachers and parents to be involved in providing the rightful career guidance to their children so that by the time they get to university, they are sure of what they want to pursue.  Parents should be involved in exposing their children to different materials and practices that will help them make their choices. Understand your child s interest in say; medicine, and allowing them to interface with medical persons as well as be exposed to hospital environments,  she advises.WHAT THE STUDENTS SAY I enrolled for a Journalism course because I had always admired being a presenter either on television or radio but because I encountered a lot of challenges getting into that field, I got demotivated and now I just write.  Kezia Koburungi, Mass Communication student KIU We live in a world of technology and innovations.

44,"Networking, easy way of growing career - Daily Monitor","For your career to take off, you will need the help of people who will avail opportunities, know-how and connections. Just like a popular quote by American businessman and media magnate Sumner Redstone states:  If you never venture beyond what you know... You have spawned your own limitations.  To grow your professional relationships, start with the people you already know; your family and friends who will eventually introduce you to their family and friends, which will continuously expand your networking circle to a level that is satisfactory to you. Although networking might be difficult for naturally introverted people, they must make an effort to go out and meet new people because that is one way in which careers and businesses are built. TV personality, fashion designer and host of the popular Kwivuga Poetry Sessions, Nunu Umuringa Butare s career is an embodiment of the power of networking. As a social entrepreneur, her business depends on the good will of as many people as possible.  I was lucky to realise that one cannot grow or succeed in a vacuum so I set out to meet as many people as possible and make meaningful connections. I attend every event I am invited to, offer help whenever I am called upon, and treat every connection with as much respect as possible,  she says. Breaking barriersNetworks have the power to break barriers and establish the most unlikely relationships. Edwin Musiime, the NTV Property Show presenter, says he has entered the House of Lords, accessed the United States White House relying on the power of networks.  I always say that our networks determine our net worth. The power of networking has enabled me attain high levels of leverage across all spheres of influence. The Bible says iron sharpens iron; people make you a better, wiser and stronger person  Musiime reveals. Networks also help influence decision, avail mentors, life coaches and role models that are very essential for both business and career growth. As Musiime says, we are always five people away from the person we want to meet the most in the universe; someone you know might know someone who knows someone else, who knows that person you believe has the power to change your life forever.  One of my role models and personal mentor is Vusi Thembekwayo who is regarded as the world s youngest and most impressive public speaker and I met him through my vast connections. I can testify that meeting him changed my life in all ways; financially, emotionally and spiritually,  adds Musiime.Nourish relationshipsLike all relationships in life, networks need to be cultivated and nurtured or they die off. Public relations specialist Muhereza Kyamutetera avers that networks need reciprocity and integrity to flourish.  In life, we all look for relationships that benefit us either financially, emotionally or intellectually. We, therefore, seek to make connections with people that are likely to fulfill those desires. Likewise, people are drawn to us because of what they think we can do for them. So meeting these expectations is important,  Kyamutetera opines. He further recommends treating every individual relationship with the utmost importance and respect. Join an associationMost professions have an association or union that brings people together. Wilson Kutegeka, the chief executive officer of ClinicMaster, is a member of the Information and Communications Technology Association of Uganda (ICTAU).  I have benefited through connections with international organisations such as the Netherlands Trust Fund which helped develop ClinicMaster to suit international standards thus getting us clients from all over the East Africa region. This would have been a very expensive and strenuous task had I undertaken it on my own,  Kutegeka shares.

45,Suicide: What is plaguing university students  - Daily Monitor,"On March 21, 2019 Ugandans woke up to news that Arthur Basalirwa, a student of Makerere University Business School (MUBS), had committed suicide. A few hours before his death, Basalirwa had posted on one of his social media accounts saying,  I am sorry but it s too late, I m sorry too much weighing on me, I do not want to live to see another day. Basalirwa had posted several other statements on social media earlier in the month which friends were later to realise were revelations that he was going through tough times but did not think deeply about them until they learnt about his death.In September 2018, Joshua Ajuna was found dead in his room in Nsibirwa Hall at Makerere University. Next to his body was a bottle of suspected poison and two suicides notes. According to the notes, personal reasons had driven Ajuna to kill himself. Earlier in April 2011, Francis Kigenyi, 23, had jumped to his death from the fifth floor of Baskon hostel on Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road in Kampala. Before his death, Kigenyi had told guests at his birthday party that his life was worthless and referred to himself as a ghost.Yet Joshua Nuwasasira, 22, a second-year student of Makerere University Business School, Mbarara study centre had in 2012, also committed suicide after he apparently spent every penny of his tuition fees on drinking and partying. He was found hanging in his rented room in Nkokonjeru, Mbarara.These are some of the suicide cases that have been reported at universities over the years, making the situation worrying. What could drive a student who is largely dependent on their parents to take their own life  DepressionAccording to Margaret Kyosaba Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, the main reason for suicides among university students is depression. She says this depression in most cases arises from maladjusted relationships, financial challenges, stress, academic anxiety, low self-esteem, drug abuse, poor performance, career indecision, uncertainty about post-school life and other informational needs. I have had chance to interact with some students who are contemplating suicide; most of them feel as though there is no way out of their situation. They are bombarded with feelings of hopelessness, fear, isolation, hatred toward themselves and so much more. The pain they feel is often immeasurable, to a point where they see no other option but to end their lives,  she explains.How can you tell Jean Nuwagaba, the head of counselling department Kyambogo University, says when a student is depressed, they may show signs of being overly sensitive to how they are perceived by others, their failures, and their relationships. They will also show signs of hopelessness, helplessness, unexplained fear of people, places, events, or objects (phobias), escapism, and general unusual or unacceptable behaviour such as drug abuse and unwarranted sexual escapades. She says sometimes some of these people overuse defense mechanisms such as denial, blame, and projection which are also indicative of mental health issues.Nevertheless, Nuwagaba says a student in such a state can get assistance through psychological interventions such as counselling, guidance, and other forms of psychosocial support.  Extreme cases should be taken to clinical psychologists or psychiatrists for further treatment,  she says.Sometimes students get depressed but fail to get anybody to talk to yet counsellors say talking can go a long way in helping one overcome painful circumstances.University intervention Ritah Namisango, the spokesperson Makerere University, says Makerere University (Mak) has a functional Counselling and Guidance Centre. The Mak Counselling and Guidance Centre is headed by a manager who is supported by professional counsellors. The managers and counsellors are fulltime members of staff at the university. The centre provides professional counselling services to both students and staff and the services are available to help students deal with and solve challenges of living that would otherwise affect their academic achievement and their wholesome being in general. She explains that the centre handles issues such as academics; for instance failure to understand or conceptualise what is taught and failure to make the required grades. It also handles psychological problems such as sexual dysfunctions, family problems, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, bereavement, and love relationships such as being dumped by a lover, failure to relate with a lover or other people, failure to quit an oppressive relationship, as well as psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, drug addiction, sexual harassment, HIV/Aids counselling.Apart from providing students with career guidance, the guidance and counselling unit provides first year students with a fresher s orientation where they explain to new entrants the dos and don ts of university life. During this fresher s orientation week, we give every new student at Makerere University an instruction booklet, which is meant to guide them on their life at university,  she says. This, she explains, is to minimise cases of transitional challenges.But Namisango is quick to note that the attendance of these guidance and counselling services is voluntary.At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.Luckily, she adds that the unit has handled quite a number of depression cases among students so far.  Ever since the inception of this facility, we have tried to popularise our services among students, by distributing flyers to students, notices on noticeboards around the university and making outreaches in student hostels,  she explains.Why are students adamant Unfortunately, some students are not embracing counselling and guidance services yet. According to Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, though universities have created counselling departments, some students are still skeptical to go in for these services. She says some are afraid of being seen by their peers obtaining such services. It is unfortunate that though counselling is very vital for university students, some find it uncalled for and shaming,  she says, adding that for this reason at Kyambogo, they have started online counselling services to help students who would prefer online to physical meetings. Namisango also admits that though the counselling services are free, some students opt out since they are not compulsory. Way forward Biribonwa says it is high time university students accepted that everyone gets depressed at some point in their lives. However, how long it lasts is one of the key factors to determine the severity.  If depression has lasted for more than two weeks and it is affecting your day-to-day life, it is time to get treatment,  she advises.Biribonwa insists that there is absolutely no shame in getting help adding that it is important for any student who is depressed to talk to friends and open up honestly about their feelings.  If you are feeling down, tell them that. If you need someone to talk to, tell them that, too. You might be surprised by how willing they are to help you get through it,  she advises.InterventionsStudent mentors. At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.

46,Why you need to check that school before sending your child there - Daily Monitor,"There are a number of advertisement activities that schools engage in to attract students which sometimes do not replicate what is on the ground. And a lot of times, some aspects which may impact on your child negatively might be happening at their school behind your back. Agnes Mweteise, was two years ago convinced to take her daughter to a school in Mbarara. She was largely excited about the school s performance in that year s O-Level results that were advertised extensively in the media.But a year after, the school s performance was different and a parent had raised the issue on how the administration always advertises wrong results to dupe them about the performance.  We were surprised when one of us armed with results from the newspaper cuttings found that they were not similar to those of Uganda National Examinations Board. The one advertised in the newspaper showed they had 10 students in Division One while those of UNEB showed that the school had got none,  said Mweteise who withdrew her daughter immediately. Milton Batekateka, a retired primary school teacher, blames the liberalisation policy in education and inadequate inspection, saying education officers should be keen on whatever material schools advertise in media. Mbarara district education officer, Gabriel Ahimbisibwe, warned that schools which dupe parents risk being de-registered and administrators arrested.  Any school found to be engaging in this practice will be de-registered. It is a very bad and dangerous strategy of attracting students,  says Ahimbisibwe. Low school charges Some schools charge rather very low school fees but are these commensurate to the services or what a student or pupil needs for his career development and social welfare Laban Kanywa, the chairperson Federation of Non State Institutions in Western Uganda, says parents should interest themselves in schools that charge very low school fees especially on how they go about the costs of running these schools. Those charging very low fees are only interested in the numbers but not in the standard of education. It is these schools where teachers are not paid or are unprofessional or starve students,  says Kanywa. Every TV, radio station and newspapers at the beginning of the school s term are awash with advertisements of schools. Adverts such as  we have professional staff, science laboratory, well-stocked library, swimming pool, and balanced diet , among others are common but as a parent do you take a step further to investigate whether these actually exist Andrew Kankiriho noted that the commercialisation of education has driven schools to employ all tricks to attract students. One of the schools here in Mbarara even duped the President. It claims to teach science and technology but when the President was going to visit the school, they hired old computers, welding and fabrication machines, sewing machines and forged a workshop, imagine,  said Kankiriho. He challenges parents to always do ground check on schools before enrolling children but added that even after they enrol, parents should always check on the capacity of the school to meet their expectations. Emotional violenceUnlike other forms of violence, emotional violence does not leave physical scars but wounds the heart which lowers one s esteem, dignity, and self-worth. It includes constant belittling, shaming, humiliating, negative comparisons, and frequent yelling and bullying. Nathan Mugume, the head teacher Mbarara Junior School, admits this kind of violence exists in schools and it has very disastrous effects even to a nation; such as having a violent nation. If a teacher is violent, abusive to pupils they may grow up to have violent and abusive families. As teachers we should guide, counsel, discuss and show empathy to pupils because we can either kill or build their future,  says Mugume.He says parents need to always interest themselves in checking their children s behaviour but also monitor the behaviour of school managers and staff towards the pupils.Third partiesDue to commercialisation of education, competition has forced schools to hire private brokers and agents who comb areas looking for students while spreading the  excellence  gospel of the schools.Unsuspecting parents easily get convinced by these brokers, forgetting that these are only interested in getting paid and whatever happens after is none of their business.  During our days, competition was driven by performance but now it is about the numbers you can attract just for economic gain. Why do you employ brokers if your school is sending pupils to first class institutions with good courses   Esau Muhangi, a retired secondary school teacher, asks.This is where the trouble lies. Pupils are in schools not just to learn but also make business for the proprietor.In case you check... Security. The general security at the school and in the neighbourhood should be safe. Care. Some teachers do not have proper handling of students even when they are disciplining them. Ability to teach. This is not just about having professional teachers but those who are able to teach.Hygiene. Are the toilets, latrine, kitchen, dining area and classrooms in good condition  Behaviour. The behaviour of students in a given school can give you a picture of whether it is a good school or not. Plans. Ask about the future plans of the school, especially if the school is new or just building up momentum.Performance. Consider student performance, not just in P7, S4 or S6, but the other classes too.Games. Ensure that the school pays attention and develops learners through co-curricular activities.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Check-that-school-before-sending-your-child-there/688336-5060788-hpnsow/index.html,/static/img/post47.png

49,"1,800 UPDF soldiers leave for Somalia peace mission - Daily Monitor","The UPDF has sent 1,800 soldiers on a peace keeping mission in Somalia.The Chief of Defence Forces (CDF), Gen David Muhoozi, flagged off the soldiers on Wednesday at the Peace Support Operation Training Centre, in Nakeseke District.According to a statement, the 27th Battle Group will be commanded by Col Kosiya Kuteesa who will be deputised by Col Rodgers Okiror.Gen Muhoozi, according to the statement, told the soldiers that they are headed for tough times in the war-torn country and challenged them to use the skills they have acquired in the last six months of special training. The Somalia mission is not a picnic. It is a war situation. It is a do or die mission. Watch each other s back and ensure you adhere to the principles of war and standing operation procedures all the time,  Gen Muhoozi said.More than 100 UPDF soldiers have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab militias through surprise attacks, ambushes and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).The UPDF is in Somalia under African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM), a peace keeping mission operated by the AU with the approval of the United Nations.The major incident that claimed lives of eight soldiers was in April last year when Al-Shabaab Islamist fighters attacked them as they returned to their camp.The army explained that the battle that left these soldiers lifeless, ensued after the suspected Al-Shabaab terrorists attempted to attack AMISOM Forward Operating Bases at Quoroyole, Buulo Mareer and Golwen in Lower Shabelle Region of Somalia.Gen Muhoozi told the combatants that they have gone to a war zone where operational mistakes can lead to loss of lives.The CDF reminded the soldiers that Somalia mission is built on the UPDF s pro-people ideology which is part of the reason for the Force s successes in its operations. As opposed to the previous perception that the Somalia mission was an impossible one, with discipline and adherence to rules of engagement, based on our pro-people ideology, we made the mission possible.  Gen Muhoozi said.The event was graced by the Commander Land Forces, Lt Gen Peter Elwelu, who also coordinates the Somalia Operations.Others who attended were the Chief of Training and Recruitment Maj Gen Willis Byarugaba, officials from US, UK and French Embassies in Kampala as well as Mr Curtis Crum, the country director for Global Peace Operation Initiative that helped in the training.

50,Finance cuts budget for essential drugs by Shs100b - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Health centres countrywide are likely to face a shortage of essential medicines after the Ministry of Finance slashed the budget for National Medical Stores  (NMS) for essential medicines by Shs100b.The Ministry of Health has, however, warned that the Shs100b budget shortfall will cripple health service delivery in the country.Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the minister of Health, in a telephone interview with Daily Monitor yesterday, said:  The implication is that we shall not be able to provide the needed services if the funds are not provided. Government needs to look for money to ensure that these items (essential medicines) are catered for. That is why they are called priorities.   My duty is to inform Parliament, the budget committee and other government departments that more funds should be allocated to cater for these priorities,  Dr Aceng added.The estimatesThe Ministry of Health, in its budget estimates for the Financial Year 2019/2020, requested that Ministry of Finance provides Shs496b to NMS to cater for special medicines, but only Shs396b has been availed, creating a shortfall of Shs100b. Some health units have previously experienced rampant drug stock outs, a situation that has compromised the health of Ugandans.The Shs100b shortfall is part of the Shs231b key unfunded priorities, which the ministry insists government must be availed to effectively run the health sector for the next financial year.The ministry had requested for an additional Shs100b on top of the Shs396.2b that was provided in the 2019/20 budget.The ministry says this unfunded priority will affect the provision of essential medicines to the hospitals and health centres.Overall, the Ministry of Health budget for the Financial Year 2019/2020 stands at about Shs1.2 trillion, up from Shs1.13 trillion for 2018/19 financial year. Among the other unfunded priorities is Shs43.5b outstanding arrears that haven t been cleared for the last three years. This is money that was meant to clear suppliers who have since threatened to sue the Ministry of Health, according to ministry officials. Dr Aceng said she was hopeful that the Finance ministry would source for some additional funds during the financial year to cater for the deficit. Along the financial year when revenue collection improves, the Finance ministry normally releases some additional funds to address some of these gaps, so I am hopeful that they will provide the funds to bridge the gaps,  she said.Officials from the NMS that has been hit hard by the cuts were not available to offer explanation on how they will handle the situation if the required funds are not given.The NMS spokesperson, Mr Dan Kimosho, could not be reached for a comment by press time. The chief executive officer, Mr Moses Kamabare, was reportedly out of office.The Ministry of Finance spokesperson, Mr Jim Mugunga, said:  The budget prioritizes essentials like medicines and health sector will certainly be given priority  however, it s not uncommon for sectors to lobby parliament to gain more than what was allocated through a consultative process. The reason why the oversight committees are in place is to scrutinise the budget proposals and expenditures. The prerogative is with Parliament and MPs are aware of what is in the kitty and the competing priorities.
