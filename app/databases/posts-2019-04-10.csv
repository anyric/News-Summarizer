0,Obore gets temporary relief as court blocks sacking - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. The Director of Communication and Public Affairs at Parliament, Chris Ariko Obore has got a temporary relief after court temporarily blocked termination of his services.Kampala High Court Judge Henrietta Wolayo on Wednesday issued an interim order halting the sacking of Mr Obore pending hearing and determination of the main case. Interim order is hereby issued to give time to the respondent to file a response in the main case,  ruled Justice Wolayo before extending the case to April 17 this year.The judge s decision followed submissions by lawyers, Augustine Idoot representing Mr Obore and Ms Sitina Cherotich (Parliamentary Commission) in which they asked court for an adjournment.Ms Cherotich asked court for an adjournment reasoning that the person who was supposed to swear an affidavit was out of office.Mr Obore whose employment tenure was terminated in a March 5 letter by Clerk to Parliament, Ms Jane Kibirige sued his employer challenging the decision.According to the letter, Ms Kibirige cited a report which concludes that the recruitment of Mr Obore was founded on an illegality as it was in contravention of the Parliamentary Service (Staff) Regulations. Mr Obore petitioned the court seeking an order to restrain the Parliamentary Commission, its agents and or servants from implementing a decision of the Clerk to Parliament which terminated his employment.Through his lawyers, Mr Obore wants court to issue an order maintaining the status quo until the final determination of his case.Court documents indicate that Mr Obore has since instituted a suit for prerogative reliefs to prevent the implementation of the directives of the Parliamentary Commission.He alleges that the pending main case discloses important issues to the legality and propriety of the impugned decision which matters have a high chance of success. That in May 2015, I received a letter informing me that the Parliamentary Service Commission had expressed interest in filling the position of the Director, Communication and Public Affairs. By the said letter, I was informed that I had been identified as one of the potential candidates being considered by the Commission and I was invited for an interaction over the same,  says Mr Obore in a sworn statement.He states that on August 19, 2015, the office of the Clerk to Parliament wrote to him communicating a decision in which a job was offered on probation which he accepted.According to court documents, four years later while working in the same post, Mr Obore was served with a letter informing him of the findings of the Inspectorate of government and a termination decision by the Clerk to Parliament. That I know that prior to the decision by the Commission to terminate my service, I had never been accorded a right to defend myself before the parliament service commission or any relevant body,  states Mr Obore insisting that the authority to appoint, promote and exercise disciplinary control over a member of staff of the service is vested in the Parliamentary Commission.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Obore-gets-temporary-relief-court-blocks-sacking/688334-5065552-sou7huz/index.html
1,Catholic bishop accused of raping nun - Daily Monitor,"Police on Tuesday charged an Indian bishop with repeatedly raping a nun at a rural convent in a case that has cast a new shadow on the Roman Catholic church's global sex abuse crisis.Franco Mulakkal was charged with raping the nun several times between 2014 and 2016, K. Subash, police deputy superintendent in the district of the southern state of Kerala where the investigation was carried out, told AFP.The bishop also faces charges of unlawful detention, unnatural sex and abuse of authority.Mulakkal   who faces a maximum punishment of life imprisonment   has vociferously denied the allegations.PROTESTSThe police report backing the charges ran to more than 100 pages and contained statements from nuns, priests and other bishops, media reports said.The victim filed a complaint in June last year, but police only started formal questioning in September as fury over the case mounted.In a rare public show of dissent within the church five nuns staged days of protests with dozens of supporters to force authorities to take the allegations seriously.Mulakkal was arrested in October before being released on bail. Senior members of the church in the southern state have supported the 55-year-old bishop, however, and he was cheered when he returned to his diocese.ABUSE CRISISSexual abuse by clergy and the failure to take action has mired the Roman Catholic Church in scandal across the world in recent years.In February, Pope Francis publicly addressed the sexual abuse of nuns by clerics for the first time, insisting the Vatican takes seriously reports of sexual abuse and the ""sexual slavery"" of nuns.Mulakkal is accused of repeatedly assaulting the nun from the Missionaries of Jesus order at the St Francis Mission in Kerala. The bishop was the head of the order.Speaking to AFP, Sister Anupama Kelamangalath, one of the five nuns who protested outside Kerala's High Court, said they had sought to draw attention to Church authorities who were misusing positions of power.The sister, from the Jalandhar diocese in the state, said she was relieved and delighted at the charges.""We were able to achieve this despite stiff opposition from all sides. We had no-one on our side to fight for us, but Christ.""'HOLY POWERS'She insisted the protests were not against the church but aimed ""at certain figures who misused the holy powers vested in them,"" she added.""Other than truth as our weapon, we never had anything else on our side.""She told how repeated approaches to senior church officials were ignored.""When they realised that we wouldn't back down, they had us transferred and then made false cases against our families,"" she said. These included allegations they had made death threats against the accused bishop.""We were then left with no option but to approach the police and register a case against the bishop. What else could we do ""Police say they are looking into other cases of abuse of nuns and allegations that four Kerala priests blackmailed women during confession to force them to have sex.Christians   overwhelmingly Catholic   are the third-largest religious group in India. Around 80 percent of the country's 1.3 billion population is Hindu, followed by a sizeable Muslim minority.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Catholic-bishop-accused-raping-nun-/688340-5065454-rb0saz/index.html
2,South Sudan warring rivals meet at Vatican 'peace retreat' - Daily Monitor,"South Sudan's warring rivals President Salva Kiir and rebel leader and former vice president Riek Machar began a retreat at the Vatican Wednesday aimed at finding a path to peace.The arch-rivals met at the Casa Santa Marta within the Vatican's walls, a residence for visitors and home to Pope Francis, who chose it over the traditional papal palace on his election in 2013.The unimposing hotel was the scene of historic peace talks between Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2014.Kiir and Machar last saw each other in October last year, shortly after the signing of a power-sharing deal, when Machar made a brief return to Juba for the first time since fleeing on foot in a hail of gunfire in July 2016.Machar was Kiir's vice president until a falling out in 2013 which kickstarted a civil war just two years after independence from Sudan.Battles between those from Machar's Nuer community and Kiir's Dinka people were characterised by brutal violence, rape and UN warnings about ""ethnic cleansing"".Kiir met with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte earlier Wednesday before heading to the Vatican, where he was set to meet with members of a unity government which is meant to be in place in May.The Vatican confirmed the arrival of Machar, who under the new deal will be reinstated as vice-president.The other vice-presidents expected at the retreat are James Wani Igga, Taban Deng Gai and Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior.Ecclesiastical authorities will be represented by the eight members of the South Sudan Council of Churches.The meeting will end Thursday with a speech by Pope Francis at 5pm (1500 GMT), followed by a dinner.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/South-Sudan-warring-rivals-meet-Vatican-peace-retreat/688340-5065442-xhpiefz/index.html
3,"South Sudan radio struggles to be free, and on air - Daily Monitor","South Sudan's Eye Radio journalists have been threatened, pulled off the air and forced to cower in hallways as bullets flew outside their studios.The only independent radio station in the war-wracked country has to walk a fine line between delivering credible information and not running foul of the government.""We really struggle in making sure we remain independent,"" station manager Koang Pal Chang, 45, told AFP.""Media are censoring themselves so they avoid having problems with authority.""The radio station began broadcasting in the years leading up to South Sudan's independence in 2011. Then, in 2013, war erupted as President Salva Kiir and his former vice-president Riek Machar fell out.In 2016, a peace deal fell apart, and Juba was hit by three days of fighting, concentrated in the neighbourhood of Jebel, home to Machar's headquarters and the Eye Radio studios.""The bullets were flying all over and even our newsroom was hit. We could see a gunship hovering around, it was like being in a movie,"" said Chang.According to the station manager, Eye Radio has about a million listeners out of an estimated population of 12 million in a country where few have access to a radio.This makes it challenging to disseminate crucial information -- about the signing of a fresh peace agreement in September 2018, for example.""There are places where ... people don't even know about the peace agreement. There is no kind of media,"" said Chang.Language and illiteracy barriersSouth Sudan has around 60 indigenous languages, no electrical grid, and less than four percent of people have internet access at home, according to the International Telecommunication Union.A 2017 study by humanitarian organisation REACH, found language and illiteracy to be the greatest barriers to news in the world's youngest country.Radio is the main source of information, while in camps for the displaced, loudspeakers are also used.In South Sudan, ""one of the most frequently-cited emergency news sources was gunshot"", to communicate information, the study found.""Some South Sudanese rely fully on traditional forms of communication ... such as sending runners to the neighbouring communities, performing war songs, displaying smoke signals... to alert about a threat or an unfortunate event,"" it added.Eye Radio is the only national broadcaster to provide a digest of the week's news in several local languages.South Sudan also has the United Nation's Radio Miraya, Radio Tamazuj broadcast from outside the country, the Catholic Radio network, and dozens of small community-based radio stations.In a country where 70 percent of the population is illiterate, newspapers are barely read outside the capital and face their own challenges.""You see blank pages (in the newspaper). Security (forces) are stationed at the printing press to go through the content before it is published,"" a local reporter told AFP on condition of anonymity.Pulled off airIn 2016, Eye Radio was briefly pulled off the air after playing a 30-second clip of Machar speaking.""Other media were shut down completely,"" said Chang.Nowadays, instead of playing voice recordings of opposition leaders, Eye Radio simply paraphrases their statements.More difficult to get around is the insecurity. Journalists are unable to leave the capital or main towns to report.""There are so many attacks on the road. Sometimes we send journalists but mostly on a organised trip"" with the UN or aid agencies, said Chang.Money is another challenge. A six-year grant from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) is ending soon.To cut costs, the station has reduced newsroom staff and installed 200 solar panels to reduce roughly by half the $10,000 spent on fuelling generators every month.""Without donor funding, the country's only independent radio station will have to go off air,"" said Charles Haskins of non-profit Internees, a partner of USAID.According to Reporters Without Borders, at least 10 journalists were killed in South Sudan between 2014 and 2017. Reporters face ""harassment, arbitrary detention, torture or execution-style murder.""Add trauma to the list, journalist Gargan Abraham Malka, 25, told AFP.""You see dead bodies, violence, these things are very normal... What is bad is when you see someone that has got an injury from gunfire and is struggling with life, but you can't give him help.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/South-Sudan-radio-struggles-free-on-air/688340-5065436-cs12uc/index.html

6,Parliament probes $41 million South Sudan grain deal - Daily Monitor,"A Parliamentary Select  Committee on South Sudan Compensation is probing Uganda s role in the infamous sorghum (dura) supply saga in which companies that received payments for cereals from the government of South Sudan government, never delivered them.  The South Sudan government reportedly paid up to $1 million (Shs3.7 billion) to numerous domestic contractors to supply food to the country ahead of a then a projected famine in 2008.Under the purchase, the government of South Sudan had sought to stock dura (sorghum), a staple food in South Sudan.However, the food was never delivered, starting what was later referred to as the Dura saga. A team of World Bank auditors established later that 290 companies were paid without signed contracts and another 151 companies were overpaid. It has since been established that many of the companies involved lacked the capacity to source the required amounts of grain, while others displayed high-risk red flags.Subsequent investigations have indicated that several companies involved were shell companies that were set up hurriedly to be awarded multi-million dollar contractsMembers of the the committee on South Sudan compensation probe say they will review the matter to ascertain whether there were Ugandan companies involved in the rip off.Committee chairperson, Ms Ann Maria Nankabirwa, says they intend to find out whether some Ugandan companies that [sought or are seeking payment], supplied hot air.The committee has in recent weeks been reviewing a payment of $41 million (Shs152 billion) advanced to 10 Ugandan companies that supplied goods and services to South Sudan between 2008 and 2013, when war broke out.The 10 companies, under the Uganda South Sudan Grain Traders and Suppliers Association Ltd, got a contract to supply maize and sorghum to 10 South Sudan states under the Strategic Grain Reserves between 2008-2010, valued at $56 million (Shs208 billion). Under the agreement, the money was to be paid in five instalments.However, the South Sudan government only paid the first instalment of $15 million (Shs56 billion), leaving a balance of $41 million (Shs152 billion) prior to the outbreak of the civil war in 2013.Uganda has since secured parliamentary approval to clear the debt on behalf of the South Sudan government to traders who have been verified.The South Sudan government will then refund the money based on a repayment schedule agreed upon in a five-year Bilateral Agreement that runs from 2018- 2022.The companies that were subject to the 2010 Memorandum of Understanding between Uganda and South Sudan include Rubya Investments, Kibungo Enterprises, Aponye (U) Limited, Afro Kai Ltd, Swift Commodities Establishment Ltd, Sunrise Commodities, Ms Sophie Omari, Apo General Agencies, Ropani International and K.K Transporters. Others that were not included on the list include; Roko Construction Company, Ake-jo General Enterprise, JB Traders, Odyek Ejang Company, Dott Services, Gunya Company Limited, Premier Mompany, MFK company, among others.Committee had earlier observed that they need to meet South Sudan government officials on the compensation matter. Meanwhile, suppliers have called on the government to expedite the process of compensation saying they are losing their property and many of them getting out of business.According to Geoffrey Okwir Gunya, who is demanding up to $88,000, several Ugandans have lost their capital and investments because of the nature of trading in South Sudan. He said Parliament should speed up the process to ensure that the traders are compensated equitably.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Parliament-41-million-South-Sudan-grain-deal-Aponye/688334-5064764-mv0yt7z/index.html

8,"No money for electoral reforms, says Otafiire - Daily Monitor","PARLIAMENT. The Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs, Maj Gen (Rtd) Kahinda Otafiire, yesterday said the government is yet to handle the long awaited constitutional review process, including tabling of the proposed electoral reforms, due to lack of funds. While appearing before the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee to present the Ministerial Policy Statement for Financial Year 2019/20, Gen Otafiire said his ministry needs Shs13.5b to constitute the Constitution Review Commission and facilitate it to do the work.He said the government plan was to deal with the electoral reforms during the constitutional review process because they all affect amendments in the Constitution. The minister was responding to queries from Kitagwenda County MP Abbas Agaba, who chairs the committee. Mr Agaba told the minister that the public is asking questions how the 2021 elections will be held without reforms. We are ready for beginning of the exercise but finance have been a problem. So we wait. Now, in the event that the constitutional review delays, it will otherwise constrain our processing of our electoral reforms,  Gen Otafiire said.The minister said since the constitutional review exercise will delay, he promised that government would soon table electoral reforms in Parliament.  I think we shall have to deal with the electoral reforms as they are and we shall be bringing them to Parliament in due course,  Gen Otafiire added. Yesterday, MPs also tasked the minister to explain why the six districts that started on July 1 last year have not held elections. They also asked Gen Otafiire to explain why it takes long for the High Court and Court of Appeal to dispose of election petitions.Ms Dorothy Azairwe Kabaraitsya, the Kamwenge Woman MP, said legislators, who have pending election petitions in courts of law, have failed to settle down in the House three years after 2016 elections. We are already on a new roadmap but there are still pending cases in court. The MPs cannot serve their people because they are up and down due to unresolved petitions,  she said.Gen Otafiire, in response, denied responsibility over the delayed elections in new districts, referring MPs to the ministry of Finance, which he said has not released money. On the delayed election petitions, he said the law bars him from interfering with the work of the Judiciary hence not in position to question judges on delayed delivery of rulings.Poll reforms  demandBackground. The demand for electoral reforms has been outstanding since the Supreme Court ruling in the presidential election petition filed by former prime minister Amama Mbabazi in February 2016.On January 30, Parliament gave government up to the end of April to table the electoral reforms. The Electoral Commission last year launched the 2021 election roadmap and some of the activities are already being implemented.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/No-money-for-electoral-reforms-Otafiire/688334-5064364-lk41ca/index.html
9,URA officials quizzed over missing fuel - Daily Monitor,"PARLIAMENT. Officials of the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) have failed to explain circumstances under which 9,733 litres of impounded fuel disappeared in their custody.The officials led by the Commissioner General, Ms Doris Akol, were appearing before the Parliamentary Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises (Cosase) chaired by Kawempe South MP Mubarak Munyagwa.The committee was scrutinising the Auditor General s report for Financial Year 2013/14 where it emerged that impounded fuel belonging to Fuelex Company was 9,733 litres less upon release by URA. According to the Auditor General s report, URA seized 110,481 litres of petrol on May 30, 2006. The report adds that due taxes and penalties worth Shs93.9m were assessed and paid by the tax payer. But on the day of collecting the fuel, it was established that it was less.Consequently, a sum of Shs63.3m was agreed and paid to the owner as compensation. The point of concern was that whereas taxes were collected at a rate of Shs850 per litre, compensation was at a higher rate of Shs6,508.72 per litre. The fuel lost was only 8.81 per cent of the original seized quantity as compared to the compensation of 67.46 per cent of the taxes collected. There was no documentary proof that the officials responsible for the loss were ever reprimanded. Failure to reprimand the responsible officers against such losses may continue to escalate the problem due to negligence,  the Auditor General s report read in part.Ms Akol told the committee that the loss was incurred during storage at a private depot.But committee members, including Mr Ibrahim Kasozi (FDC, Makindye East) and Mr Paul Mwiru (FDC, Jinja East), tasked the officials to explain the circumstances under which the fuel went missing and the disparities in cost per litre. The other URA officials present were Mr James Kisale, the then URA commissioner in-charge of enforcement, and Ms Agnes Nabwire, the assistant commissioner for customs.  This particular matter, we are actually privileged to have the person who handled this matter [Mr Kisale]; I think he is better positioned to explain,  Ms Nabwire said. Before digging further into the testimonies, Mr Munyagwa cautioned the witnesses before hand. I want to ask our witnesses not to take this committee for granted, we have a huge backlog. Respect the committee,  he said.URA responseMr Kisale said the fuel was impounded on suspicion that it had been falsified to be destined for neighbouring DR Congo yet it was for use within Uganda.He also said they erred when they failed to take measurements at customs in Malaba.   I am not comfortable with this conversation from James; I think he is trying to escape from his responsibility as the supervisor at the time you impounded things, you don t know what you impounded and you accepted the authority to pay what you didn t ascertain   wondered Mr Kasozi.The MP advised that Shs63.3m that was paid as compensation should be recovered from Mr Kisale. Mr Munyagwa stressed:  James [Kisale], we can t believe you; you can t tell us that you are running URA like a market, you impound fuel and you don t know how much it is.  He added:  A number of Ugandans out there are out of business because of errant officials within URA. We must investigate this fuel to its logical conclusion.

10,Katosi scam: Senkeeto granted bail - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Apollo Senkeeto, a businessman, who was convicted for corruption in the infamous Mukono-Katosi road construction saga, yesterday regained temporary freedom after the Court of Appeal released him on bail, pending the hearing of his appeal.Senkeeto was released on a cash bail of Shs10m by Justice Cheborion Barishaki.   In deciding whether or not to grant bail, pending appeal, court should, in addition to other considerations, determine whether the appellant (Senkeeto in this case), is likely to commit further offences. The applicant was convicted of the offence of theft, fraud and uttering false documents. These offences do not involve personal violence,  Justice Barishaki ruled. For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the applicant meets the conditions for grant of bail, pending appeal and I grant the same,  he added.Under the bail terms, Senkeeto will report to the registrar of the court every month, deposit in court his passport and duplicate title deed for his land in Gombe.His three sureties, Rev Canon Albert Samuel Senkeeto, Allan Kulumba and Ms Rose Nakibirige, were ordered to ensure Senkeeto attends court as and when he is required. Each surety was bonded at Shs20m (not cash).In the submissions to support his bail application, Senkeeto argued that the hearing of his appeal was likely to delay, that he was pursuing further studies at African Bible University at Lubowa and suffers severe back problem that requires specialised medication that cannot be accessed in Luzira prison.Justice Barishaki warned him that should he violate any of the bail terms, it would lead to automatic cancellation of his bail and he returns to Luzira prison.Senkeeto was convicted by the Anti-Corruption Court in August last year for theft of Shs24.7b, obtaining money by false pretence, uttering false documents and conspiracy to defraud in the Mukono-Katosi road project scam. He was convicted along with officials from the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra).

11,Suicide: What is plaguing university students  - Daily Monitor,"On March 21, 2019 Ugandans woke up to news that Arthur Basalirwa, a student of Makerere University Business School (MUBS), had committed suicide. A few hours before his death, Basalirwa had posted on one of his social media accounts saying,  I am sorry but it s too late, I m sorry too much weighing on me, I do not want to live to see another day. Basalirwa had posted several other statements on social media earlier in the month which friends were later to realise were revelations that he was going through tough times but did not think deeply about them until they learnt about his death.In September 2018, Joshua Ajuna was found dead in his room in Nsibirwa Hall at Makerere University. Next to his body was a bottle of suspected poison and two suicides notes. According to the notes, personal reasons had driven Ajuna to kill himself. Earlier in April 2011, Francis Kigenyi, 23, had jumped to his death from the fifth floor of Baskon hostel on Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road in Kampala. Before his death, Kigenyi had told guests at his birthday party that his life was worthless and referred to himself as a ghost.Yet Joshua Nuwasasira, 22, a second-year student of Makerere University Business School, Mbarara study centre had in 2012, also committed suicide after he apparently spent every penny of his tuition fees on drinking and partying. He was found hanging in his rented room in Nkokonjeru, Mbarara.These are some of the suicide cases that have been reported at universities over the years, making the situation worrying. What could drive a student who is largely dependent on their parents to take their own life  DepressionAccording to Margaret Kyosaba Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, the main reason for suicides among university students is depression. She says this depression in most cases arises from maladjusted relationships, financial challenges, stress, academic anxiety, low self-esteem, drug abuse, poor performance, career indecision, uncertainty about post-school life and other informational needs. I have had chance to interact with some students who are contemplating suicide; most of them feel as though there is no way out of their situation. They are bombarded with feelings of hopelessness, fear, isolation, hatred toward themselves and so much more. The pain they feel is often immeasurable, to a point where they see no other option but to end their lives,  she explains.How can you tell Jean Nuwagaba, the head of counselling department Kyambogo University, says when a student is depressed, they may show signs of being overly sensitive to how they are perceived by others, their failures, and their relationships. They will also show signs of hopelessness, helplessness, unexplained fear of people, places, events, or objects (phobias), escapism, and general unusual or unacceptable behaviour such as drug abuse and unwarranted sexual escapades. She says sometimes some of these people overuse defense mechanisms such as denial, blame, and projection which are also indicative of mental health issues.Nevertheless, Nuwagaba says a student in such a state can get assistance through psychological interventions such as counselling, guidance, and other forms of psychosocial support.  Extreme cases should be taken to clinical psychologists or psychiatrists for further treatment,  she says.Sometimes students get depressed but fail to get anybody to talk to yet counsellors say talking can go a long way in helping one overcome painful circumstances.University intervention Ritah Namisango, the spokesperson Makerere University, says Makerere University (Mak) has a functional Counselling and Guidance Centre. The Mak Counselling and Guidance Centre is headed by a manager who is supported by professional counsellors. The managers and counsellors are fulltime members of staff at the university. The centre provides professional counselling services to both students and staff and the services are available to help students deal with and solve challenges of living that would otherwise affect their academic achievement and their wholesome being in general. She explains that the centre handles issues such as academics; for instance failure to understand or conceptualise what is taught and failure to make the required grades. It also handles psychological problems such as sexual dysfunctions, family problems, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, bereavement, and love relationships such as being dumped by a lover, failure to relate with a lover or other people, failure to quit an oppressive relationship, as well as psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, drug addiction, sexual harassment, HIV/Aids counselling.Apart from providing students with career guidance, the guidance and counselling unit provides first year students with a fresher s orientation where they explain to new entrants the dos and don ts of university life. During this fresher s orientation week, we give every new student at Makerere University an instruction booklet, which is meant to guide them on their life at university,  she says. This, she explains, is to minimise cases of transitional challenges.But Namisango is quick to note that the attendance of these guidance and counselling services is voluntary.At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.Luckily, she adds that the unit has handled quite a number of depression cases among students so far.  Ever since the inception of this facility, we have tried to popularise our services among students, by distributing flyers to students, notices on noticeboards around the university and making outreaches in student hostels,  she explains.Why are students adamant Unfortunately, some students are not embracing counselling and guidance services yet. According to Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, though universities have created counselling departments, some students are still skeptical to go in for these services. She says some are afraid of being seen by their peers obtaining such services. It is unfortunate that though counselling is very vital for university students, some find it uncalled for and shaming,  she says, adding that for this reason at Kyambogo, they have started online counselling services to help students who would prefer online to physical meetings. Namisango also admits that though the counselling services are free, some students opt out since they are not compulsory. Way forward Biribonwa says it is high time university students accepted that everyone gets depressed at some point in their lives. However, how long it lasts is one of the key factors to determine the severity.  If depression has lasted for more than two weeks and it is affecting your day-to-day life, it is time to get treatment,  she advises.Biribonwa insists that there is absolutely no shame in getting help adding that it is important for any student who is depressed to talk to friends and open up honestly about their feelings.  If you are feeling down, tell them that. If you need someone to talk to, tell them that, too. You might be surprised by how willing they are to help you get through it,  she advises.InterventionsStudent mentors.

Ritah Namisango, the spokesperson Makerere University, says the university has a functional Counselling and Guidance Centre. The managers and counsellors are fulltime members of staff at the university. The centre provides professional counselling services to both students and staff and the services are available at the Centre to help students deal with and solve challenges of living that would otherwise affect their academic achievement and their wholesome being in general.

12,Why you need to check that school before sending your child there - Daily Monitor,"There are a number of advertisement activities that schools engage in to attract students which sometimes do not replicate what is on the ground. And a lot of times, some aspects which may impact on your child negatively might be happening at their school behind your back. Agnes Mweteise, was two years ago convinced to take her daughter to a school in Mbarara. She was largely excited about the school s performance in that year s O-Level results that were advertised extensively in the media.But a year after, the school s performance was different and a parent had raised the issue on how the administration always advertises wrong results to dupe them about the performance.  We were surprised when one of us armed with results from the newspaper cuttings found that they were not similar to those of Uganda National Examinations Board. The one advertised in the newspaper showed they had 10 students in Division One while those of UNEB showed that the school had got none,  said Mweteise who withdrew her daughter immediately. Milton Batekateka, a retired primary school teacher, blames the liberalisation policy in education and inadequate inspection, saying education officers should be keen on whatever material schools advertise in media. Mbarara district education officer, Gabriel Ahimbisibwe, warned that schools which dupe parents risk being de-registered and administrators arrested.  Any school found to be engaging in this practice will be de-registered. It is a very bad and dangerous strategy of attracting students,  says Ahimbisibwe. Low school charges Some schools charge rather very low school fees but are these commensurate to the services or what a student or pupil needs for his career development and social welfare Laban Kanywa, the chairperson Federation of Non State Institutions in Western Uganda, says parents should interest themselves in schools that charge very low school fees especially on how they go about the costs of running these schools. Those charging very low fees are only interested in the numbers but not in the standard of education. It is these schools where teachers are not paid or are unprofessional or starve students,  says Kanywa. Every TV, radio station and newspapers at the beginning of the school s term are awash with advertisements of schools. Adverts such as  we have professional staff, science laboratory, well-stocked library, swimming pool, and balanced diet , among others are common but as a parent do you take a step further to investigate whether these actually exist Andrew Kankiriho noted that the commercialisation of education has driven schools to employ all tricks to attract students. One of the schools here in Mbarara even duped the President. It claims to teach science and technology but when the President was going to visit the school, they hired old computers, welding and fabrication machines, sewing machines and forged a workshop, imagine,  said Kankiriho. He challenges parents to always do ground check on schools before enrolling children but added that even after they enrol, parents should always check on the capacity of the school to meet their expectations. Emotional violenceUnlike other forms of violence, emotional violence does not leave physical scars but wounds the heart which lowers one s esteem, dignity, and self-worth. It includes constant belittling, shaming, humiliating, negative comparisons, and frequent yelling and bullying. Nathan Mugume, the head teacher Mbarara Junior School, admits this kind of violence exists in schools and it has very disastrous effects even to a nation; such as having a violent nation. If a teacher is violent, abusive to pupils they may grow up to have violent and abusive families. As teachers we should guide, counsel, discuss and show empathy to pupils because we can either kill or build their future,  says Mugume.He says parents need to always interest themselves in checking their children s behaviour but also monitor the behaviour of school managers and staff towards the pupils.Third partiesDue to commercialisation of education, competition has forced schools to hire private brokers and agents who comb areas looking for students while spreading the  excellence  gospel of the schools.Unsuspecting parents easily get convinced by these brokers, forgetting that these are only interested in getting paid and whatever happens after is none of their business.  During our days, competition was driven by performance but now it is about the numbers you can attract just for economic gain. Why do you employ brokers if your school is sending pupils to first class institutions with good courses   Esau Muhangi, a retired secondary school teacher, asks.This is where the trouble lies. Pupils are in schools not just to learn but also make business for the proprietor.In case you check... Security. The general security at the school and in the neighbourhood should be safe. Care. Some teachers do not have proper handling of students even when they are disciplining them. Ability to teach. This is not just about having professional teachers but those who are able to teach.Hygiene. Are the toilets, latrine, kitchen, dining area and classrooms in good condition  Behaviour. The behaviour of students in a given school can give you a picture of whether it is a good school or not. Plans. Ask about the future plans of the school, especially if the school is new or just building up momentum.Performance. Consider student performance, not just in P7, S4 or S6, but the other classes too.Games. Ensure that the school pays attention and develops learners through co-curricular activities.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Check-that-school-before-sending-your-child-there/688336-5060788-hpnsow/index.html
13,Dedicated to pupils with special needs - Daily Monitor,"Maria Nansubuga Galiwango was supposed to be a journalist. That is what she longed for as a child. She thought that each of her days would be filled with an adventure of travelling to new places.Instead, after completing Senior Four, her elder brother encouraged her to become a teacher because of her love for children. That was the turning point as Nansubuga joined Gaba Teachers College where she graduated with a certificate in primary school teaching. It was the beginning of the journey into the unknown. She got a job at a school that she never thought would change her life forever.Tough startIn 2012, Nansubuga joined Hill Preparatory School, Naguru, kickstarting her journey in teaching.  I was given an inclusion class but that was a big challenge,  the 32-year-old said.An inclusive class has learners with disabilities and special education learning alongside their non-disabled peers. I had no interest at first. I was even afraid but after prayer I realised that this was a special group of people God had allowed me to reach,  Nansubuga recalls.As we sat for the interview, the love from the children was evident. A couple of them played with her while some hugged her, interrupting the session at several stages.Getting into the grooveA multi-talented teacher, Nansubuga later completed her diploma at Uganda Martyrs University-Nkozi in 2015 courtesy of the school director Clare Wavamunno and head teacher Ambrose Kibuuka. She attended several school trainings at Lugogo in Kampala which were regularly organised by Special Olympics Uganda as well as Umoja Global Community Music Therapy. The British Council also offered her an opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom in 2014 during an exchange programme to improve her skills of teaching special needs children.  I picked interest in furthering my knowledge of special needs education because I found these children amazing. They are so loving and I started seeing Jesus in them,  she said.Another dimensionNansubuga who teaches English and Mathematics, currently conducts private lessons at the convenience of the parents  homes for the last one year.Although she left Hill last year, she still goes there to conduct swimming lessons on a private arrangement.Nansubuga said she is now married to teaching even though she opted to start her private classes which she says offered her greener pastures. There are some parents who are still not comfortable bringing their special needs children in public and I find that an opportunity to reach out to them and help them develop,  she said.Nansubuga said she chose that approach because it is exciting yet she has a passion for seeing children with special needs excel. For special needs children, there s something new everyday, she says. They are fun and can be a challenge sometimes especially children with intellectual disabilities but we get to know each other. Nansubuga believes a good special needs educator is someone who has a passion for what they teach, and who you teach.  Being flexible and passionate is something I take pride in as an educator. I constantly talk to them to be able to build self-esteem. She was forced into swimming to tame autistic children who are normally hyper, especially after lunch making it necessary to curb extra energy.The common intellectual disability cases she has handled include; autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Each of those cases are handled differently and that is the best lesson I have learned in life. Everyone is different from the other,  she notes, adding that loving such children is what makes us human.Moving onNansubuga agrees that she cannot get all the money she needs from teaching as such she handles different projects. After opting to leave Hill Preparatory School last year, she joined Kampala International Pre-School in Naguru before she settled at Bourneville International School. She supplements this by working in a network marketing company, Success, which deals in cryptocurrencies. I do personal work with Success online and I never have to worry about my teaching appointments,  she says about her balancing act.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Dedicated-pupils-with-special-needs/688336-5060824-glwrmwz/index.html
14,NTCs should offer computer courses - Daily Monitor,"Despite computer being one of the subjects taught in schools today, several National Teacher s College (NTCs) across the country do not conduct these courses for their students. As such several stakeholders in the education sector have called on the Education ministry to consider having in place computer courses to produce teachers who can impart computer education to the learners. Last year, National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), recommended that computer studies must be taught at both O and A-Level.In fact Denis Tabo, a former student of Gulu Central High School told Daily Monitor that limited access to computer labs, and lack of computer books was the reason why students performed dismally in computer exams in the 2018-2019 national exams. We used to access computer lab twice a week for only 80 minutes a day which is not enough for a student to practice,   he said. He also cited lack of computer books that has made most of the students fail the theory part of the computer exams due to limited books in various schools. But Michael Okidi, the head teacher Layibi High School, advised schools to take up computer lessons when they already have in place enough computers and well-trained computer teachers. Lack of professional teachers is forcing us to hire anybody with a Bachelors in Computer Science some of whom are not equipped with the right knowledge of teaching students,  he said. Charles Nyakito, the principal Unyama NTC, said computer studies are not yet in their curriculum.  We have been advocating for Kyambogo University to substitute Typewriting course with computer studies but we are not yet successful,  Nyakito said. Currently, only Business Education students at Unyama NTC are taught computer, which is a small group,  he adds.Decrying the status quo, Ronald Lukyamuzi, the vice chairman Information and Communication Technology Teachers Association of Uganda, said most of the members of the association are not professional teachers but university ICT and Computer Science graduates.  Government should also equip all the schools teaching computer studies with computers. Most schools have only about five computers which are shared by 60 students and no projector to support teachers in class,  he said. Computer studies were included in secondary school syllabus to encourage practical work and skills to allow students to accommodate the changing technologies in ICT.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/NTCs-should-offer-computer-courses/688336-5060874-jfktjhz/index.html
15,"Help local communities benefit from tourism, experts tell government - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government should find innovative ways of helping communities around protected areas earn from tourism if they are to appreciate and protect the parks, experts have suggested.Dr Dilys Roe, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), a London-based think-tank, said if communities feel that parks do not benefit them, they resort to poaching.She made the remarks while giving a keynote address into the threats to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and some innovative ideas for new community-based solutions in Kampala last week. The lecture was organised by Aga Khan Development Network. Citing their nearly two years  experience in helping communities around Bwindi tap into tourism, Dr Roe said many people can benefit from gorilla tracking indirectly through selling items to tourists. Gorillas are key attraction in Uganda. They are particularly important because there aren t many countries in the world where you can find gorillas. So the tourism market is here or in Rwanda,  she said.  That really sounds positive, but the other side of the story is where that money goes. Dr Roe said local communities can earn from tourism if they are trained to work as professional guides, sell food or offer authentic cultural experiences and not necessarily wait for the 10 per cent park revenue ploughed back by government. TrainingShe said IIED has already trained some residents to offer the services.Gorilla-tracking in Bwindi generates revenue for conservation, but local benefits from tourism are limited and the illegal use of the park s resources continues.Tourism is a top foreign exchange earner and Uganda last year raked in $1.4b (Shs5 trillion) from the sector, according to government statistics.Mr Amin Mawji, the Aga Khan Development Network representative in Uganda, said the lectures are aimed at creating  a space for conversation... a space for illumination where leaders and opinion formers can come together to reflect on the big issues of our time, to explore new ideas and fresh perspectives, and to promote new solutions to the problems that face us and our children. The lecture examined some of the challenges facing the tourism sector. Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, the Tourism minister, lauded the Aga Khan Development Network for organising the lecture and contributing to the development of Uganda.He said government is committed to conserving the environment but sometimes they are let down by rampant poverty among Ugandans, bad attitude and the growing population of people and animals that compete for space.The lecture was attended by Mr Daudi Migereko, the chairman of Uganda Tourist Board, several ambassadors and senior leadership of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Help-local-communities-benefit-from-tourism-experts-tell-govt/688334-5063750-gaoykg/index.html
16,Obore gets temporary relief as court blocks sacking - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. The Director of Communication and Public Affairs at Parliament, Chris Ariko Obore has got a temporary relief after court temporarily blocked termination of his services.Kampala High Court Judge Henrietta Wolayo on Wednesday issued an interim order halting the sacking of Mr Obore pending hearing and determination of the main case. Interim order is hereby issued to give time to the respondent to file a response in the main case,  ruled Justice Wolayo before extending the case to April 17 this year.The judge s decision followed submissions by lawyers, Augustine Idoot representing Mr Obore and Ms Sitina Cherotich (Parliamentary Commission) in which they asked court for an adjournment.Ms Cherotich asked court for an adjournment reasoning that the person who was supposed to swear an affidavit was out of office.Mr Obore whose employment tenure was terminated in a March 5 letter by Clerk to Parliament, Ms Jane Kibirige sued his employer challenging the decision.According to the letter, Ms Kibirige cited a report which concludes that the recruitment of Mr Obore was founded on an illegality as it was in contravention of the Parliamentary Service (Staff) Regulations. Mr Obore petitioned the court seeking an order to restrain the Parliamentary Commission, its agents and or servants from implementing a decision of the Clerk to Parliament which terminated his employment.Through his lawyers, Mr Obore wants court to issue an order maintaining the status quo until the final determination of his case.Court documents indicate that Mr Obore has since instituted a suit for prerogative reliefs to prevent the implementation of the directives of the Parliamentary Commission.He alleges that the pending main case discloses important issues to the legality and propriety of the impugned decision which matters have a high chance of success. That in May 2015, I received a letter informing me that the Parliamentary Service Commission had expressed interest in filling the position of the Director, Communication and Public Affairs. By the said letter, I was informed that I had been identified as one of the potential candidates being considered by the Commission and I was invited for an interaction over the same,  says Mr Obore in a sworn statement.He states that on August 19, 2015, the office of the Clerk to Parliament wrote to him communicating a decision in which a job was offered on probation which he accepted.According to court documents, four years later while working in the same post, Mr Obore was served with a letter informing him of the findings of the Inspectorate of government and a termination decision by the Clerk to Parliament. That I know that prior to the decision by the Commission to terminate my service, I had never been accorded a right to defend myself before the parliament service commission or any relevant body,  states Mr Obore insisting that the authority to appoint, promote and exercise disciplinary control over a member of staff of the service is vested in the Parliamentary Commission.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Obore-gets-temporary-relief-court-blocks-sacking/688334-5065552-sou7huz/index.html
17,Catholic bishop accused of raping nun - Daily Monitor,"Police on Tuesday charged an Indian bishop with repeatedly raping a nun at a rural convent in a case that has cast a new shadow on the Roman Catholic church's global sex abuse crisis.Franco Mulakkal was charged with raping the nun several times between 2014 and 2016, K. Subash, police deputy superintendent in the district of the southern state of Kerala where the investigation was carried out, told AFP.The bishop also faces charges of unlawful detention, unnatural sex and abuse of authority.Mulakkal   who faces a maximum punishment of life imprisonment   has vociferously denied the allegations.PROTESTSThe police report backing the charges ran to more than 100 pages and contained statements from nuns, priests and other bishops, media reports said.The victim filed a complaint in June last year, but police only started formal questioning in September as fury over the case mounted.In a rare public show of dissent within the church five nuns staged days of protests with dozens of supporters to force authorities to take the allegations seriously.Mulakkal was arrested in October before being released on bail. Senior members of the church in the southern state have supported the 55-year-old bishop, however, and he was cheered when he returned to his diocese.ABUSE CRISISSexual abuse by clergy and the failure to take action has mired the Roman Catholic Church in scandal across the world in recent years.In February, Pope Francis publicly addressed the sexual abuse of nuns by clerics for the first time, insisting the Vatican takes seriously reports of sexual abuse and the ""sexual slavery"" of nuns.Mulakkal is accused of repeatedly assaulting the nun from the Missionaries of Jesus order at the St Francis Mission in Kerala. The bishop was the head of the order.Speaking to AFP, Sister Anupama Kelamangalath, one of the five nuns who protested outside Kerala's High Court, said they had sought to draw attention to Church authorities who were misusing positions of power.The sister, from the Jalandhar diocese in the state, said she was relieved and delighted at the charges.""We were able to achieve this despite stiff opposition from all sides. We had no-one on our side to fight for us, but Christ.""'HOLY POWERS'She insisted the protests were not against the church but aimed ""at certain figures who misused the holy powers vested in them,"" she added.""Other than truth as our weapon, we never had anything else on our side.""She told how repeated approaches to senior church officials were ignored.""When they realised that we wouldn't back down, they had us transferred and then made false cases against our families,"" she said. These included allegations they had made death threats against the accused bishop.""We were then left with no option but to approach the police and register a case against the bishop. What else could we do ""Police say they are looking into other cases of abuse of nuns and allegations that four Kerala priests blackmailed women during confession to force them to have sex.Christians   overwhelmingly Catholic   are the third-largest religious group in India. Around 80 percent of the country's 1.3 billion population is Hindu, followed by a sizeable Muslim minority.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Catholic-bishop-accused-raping-nun-/688340-5065454-rb0saz/index.html
18,South Sudan warring rivals meet at Vatican 'peace retreat' - Daily Monitor,"South Sudan's warring rivals President Salva Kiir and rebel leader and former vice president Riek Machar began a retreat at the Vatican Wednesday aimed at finding a path to peace.The arch-rivals met at the Casa Santa Marta within the Vatican's walls, a residence for visitors and home to Pope Francis, who chose it over the traditional papal palace on his election in 2013.The unimposing hotel was the scene of historic peace talks between Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2014.Kiir and Machar last saw each other in October last year, shortly after the signing of a power-sharing deal, when Machar made a brief return to Juba for the first time since fleeing on foot in a hail of gunfire in July 2016.Machar was Kiir's vice president until a falling out in 2013 which kickstarted a civil war just two years after independence from Sudan.Battles between those from Machar's Nuer community and Kiir's Dinka people were characterised by brutal violence, rape and UN warnings about ""ethnic cleansing"".Kiir met with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte earlier Wednesday before heading to the Vatican, where he was set to meet with members of a unity government which is meant to be in place in May.The Vatican confirmed the arrival of Machar, who under the new deal will be reinstated as vice-president.The other vice-presidents expected at the retreat are James Wani Igga, Taban Deng Gai and Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior.Ecclesiastical authorities will be represented by the eight members of the South Sudan Council of Churches.The meeting will end Thursday with a speech by Pope Francis at 5pm (1500 GMT), followed by a dinner.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/South-Sudan-warring-rivals-meet-Vatican-peace-retreat/688340-5065442-xhpiefz/index.html
19,"South Sudan radio struggles to be free, and on air - Daily Monitor","South Sudan's Eye Radio journalists have been threatened, pulled off the air and forced to cower in hallways as bullets flew outside their studios.The only independent radio station in the war-wracked country has to walk a fine line between delivering credible information and not running foul of the government.""We really struggle in making sure we remain independent,"" station manager Koang Pal Chang, 45, told AFP.""Media are censoring themselves so they avoid having problems with authority.""The radio station began broadcasting in the years leading up to South Sudan's independence in 2011. Then, in 2013, war erupted as President Salva Kiir and his former vice-president Riek Machar fell out.In 2016, a peace deal fell apart, and Juba was hit by three days of fighting, concentrated in the neighbourhood of Jebel, home to Machar's headquarters and the Eye Radio studios.""The bullets were flying all over and even our newsroom was hit. We could see a gunship hovering around, it was like being in a movie,"" said Chang.According to the station manager, Eye Radio has about a million listeners out of an estimated population of 12 million in a country where few have access to a radio.This makes it challenging to disseminate crucial information -- about the signing of a fresh peace agreement in September 2018, for example.""There are places where ... people don't even know about the peace agreement. There is no kind of media,"" said Chang.Language and illiteracy barriersSouth Sudan has around 60 indigenous languages, no electrical grid, and less than four percent of people have internet access at home, according to the International Telecommunication Union.A 2017 study by humanitarian organisation REACH, found language and illiteracy to be the greatest barriers to news in the world's youngest country.Radio is the main source of information, while in camps for the displaced, loudspeakers are also used.In South Sudan, ""one of the most frequently-cited emergency news sources was gunshot"", to communicate information, the study found.""Some South Sudanese rely fully on traditional forms of communication ... such as sending runners to the neighbouring communities, performing war songs, displaying smoke signals... to alert about a threat or an unfortunate event,"" it added.Eye Radio is the only national broadcaster to provide a digest of the week's news in several local languages.South Sudan also has the United Nation's Radio Miraya, Radio Tamazuj broadcast from outside the country, the Catholic Radio network, and dozens of small community-based radio stations.In a country where 70 percent of the population is illiterate, newspapers are barely read outside the capital and face their own challenges.""You see blank pages (in the newspaper). Security (forces) are stationed at the printing press to go through the content before it is published,"" a local reporter told AFP on condition of anonymity.Pulled off airIn 2016, Eye Radio was briefly pulled off the air after playing a 30-second clip of Machar speaking.""Other media were shut down completely,"" said Chang.Nowadays, instead of playing voice recordings of opposition leaders, Eye Radio simply paraphrases their statements.More difficult to get around is the insecurity. Journalists are unable to leave the capital or main towns to report.""There are so many attacks on the road. Sometimes we send journalists but mostly on a organised trip"" with the UN or aid agencies, said Chang.Money is another challenge. A six-year grant from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) is ending soon.To cut costs, the station has reduced newsroom staff and installed 200 solar panels to reduce roughly by half the $10,000 spent on fuelling generators every month.""Without donor funding, the country's only independent radio station will have to go off air,"" said Charles Haskins of non-profit Internees, a partner of USAID.According to Reporters Without Borders, at least 10 journalists were killed in South Sudan between 2014 and 2017. Reporters face ""harassment, arbitrary detention, torture or execution-style murder.""Add trauma to the list, journalist Gargan Abraham Malka, 25, told AFP.""You see dead bodies, violence, these things are very normal... What is bad is when you see someone that has got an injury from gunfire and is struggling with life, but you can't give him help.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/South-Sudan-radio-struggles-free-on-air/688340-5065436-cs12uc/index.html
20,"Protect children rights amid cultural norms, says activist - Daily Monitor","Buyende/Kamuli. The  marriage  of two minors in Buyende District has sparked uproar and a call to protect children s rights.Last week, a nine-year-old boy and six-year-old girl, both allegedly born with two teeth - got  married  at a ceremony in Nakapyata, drawing mixed reactions from the public.Mr Robert Wafula, the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) project coordinator, said the children should enjoy their rights and protection despite cultural connotations.CEDAW is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly.Mr Wafula appreciated that the children are at school but regretted that their coverage, especially by television stations did not take into consideration protection policies. Their faces were not covered so once they grow up and abandon the culture and marriage, they will be haunted and traumatised,  he said. We call for communities, cultures and norms that promote children rights. It is wrong to call it a marriage or initiation and while we appreciate it in the context of culture, engaging them is wrong,  Mr Wafula added.READ:Boy aged nine marries six-year-old in BuyendeMr Henry Woira, the Isabalangira of Bugabula Chiefdom, which covers Buyende and Kamuli districts, said in Busoga Kingdom,  spirits  choose a wife who should be kept clean and virgin until she is above 18. King Mswati III of Swailand carries out an annual marriage (Reed Dance) where he is mandated to choose a virgin, often young. Aware that culture grows, Busoga blends the traditional and modern positive values and has partnered with both government and NGOs to fight child marriages, domestic violence and western invasion,  he said.Mr Woira denied reports that the children are married or sleep together in coital relationship but only carry traditional visits to their respective families, get introduced to their spirits and are encouraged to complete school.  Traditionally arranged marriages monitor virginity, keep closer relations and later bring her home. Culturally, we cherish marriage readiness and purity. That is why we offer a goat to the Ssenga (aunt) when the girl s virginity is proved at marriage,  Mr Woira said.He said traditionally arranged marriages are often meant to check against genetically transferred illnesses such as sickle cells.Ms Mandwa Kagulu Nabiryo, the custodian of Bugabula Chiefdom spirits, said the ceremony was a cultural visit in which the two were introduced to the spirits at Iyingo shrine in Kagulu Sub-county. Cultural rituals were performed to strengthen them since they are both children of the spirits. The marriage was planned and is being monitored by spirits. [The girl] will continue living with her parents until she has made 18 years then they come together as husband and wife,  Ms Nabiryo said. She said in the past, parents would  book  daughters-in-law in advance and tie a red cloth around their wrists as a sign of engagement, with vows to keep them virgins.BACKGROUNDIn December 2013, a six-months-old girl  introduced  her three-year-old fianc  to her parents in Kamwokya-Namata Village, Buyengo Sub-county in Jinja District. A memorandum of understanding was reached with the boy s entourage accepting to pay the  dowry  of 48 cows, 48 goats, 48 chicken and 48 pots of malwa (local millet brew), among others, as instructed by Nambi s clan. The boy was allegedly born with two grown teeth in his lower jaw while holding a handful of two-root (herbs) grains in the right hand. When he was six months old, his clan oracle broke the news that his  wife-to-be , known as Nambi, was to be born three years later.

The controversy surrounding the land giveaway at Njeru Stock Farm in Buikwe District has taken a new twist, with Njeru Municipality authorities saying they are demanding Shs1.3b in unpaid nominal ground rent from government, Daily Monitor has established.According to a letter dated January 2, 2019, to the Ministry of Agriculture Permanent Secretary, signed by the Njeru Municipality Town Clerk, Mr Ambrose Ocen, Njeru Stock Farm has not been remitting ground rent fees for 19 years. This is to submit invoice number 631 dated January 2, 2019, in respect of Njeru Stock Farm for the last 19 years in line with the guidance from the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to Treasury in his Circular No.ISS255/432/01 dated March, 25 2015,  the letter reads, in part.When contacted on Monday, Mr Ocen, confirmed writing the letter, saying since 2000, Njeru Stock Farm management has not paid nominal ground rent equivalent to Shs100,000 per acre for 706 acres.  the terms of the sub-lease were that they [Njeru Stock Farm] would be paying Shs100,000 per acre of land per annum as nominal ground rent, unfortunately, government stopped paying that money in 2000, and the money has accumulated to Shs1.3b,  Mr Ocen said. Earlier controversiesThis comes on the heels of reports that some chunk of land housing the government demonstration farm has been parcelled out to different individuals, including Justice Minister, Kahinda Otafiire. Njeru Stock Farm, located at Bukaaya West Village, is one of the government farms under the National Animal Genetics Resources Centre & Data Bank ((NAGRC & DB). It hosts a dairy model farm.However, Dr Wilberforce Kifudde Wandera, the technical manager from the Genetics Resources Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, said the money being demanded by Njeru Municipal Council as ground rent had been inflated. It is true Njeru Municipal Council wrote to us, but it s not true that they demand all that money, they have inflated the figure to defraud government because they claim money of 1950s during the colonial time,  he said, adding  the remaining piece of land is even less because they [Njeru Municipal Council] also sub leased more land to private developers, who acquired it through fraudulent means,  he said.He also said Njeru Stock Farm has a land tittle and wondered where individuals who claim to possess titles got them from.Last year, the Justice Catherine Bamugemeire-led Commission of Inquiry into Land Matters started investigating how private individuals acquired land on the government stock farm.Ownership of the same land is currently being contested between Ham Mukasa s family and the family of the late Enock Sebowa.Ham Mukasa reportedly leased Njeru Stock Farm land measuring 1,099 acres to the colonial government for 99 years.Prior to 2000, government was paying nominal ground rent to Ham Mukasa s family through Njeru Town Council, which has since been elevated to a municipality.When contacted, Gen Kahinda Otafiire insisted that he lawfully acquired 50 acres on Plot 280 and another 50 acres on Plot 283 off the Njeru Stock Farm land. Last September, NAGRC & DB executive director, Dr Charles Lagu, told the Bamugemereire Commission that Njeru Stock Farm was on the brink of losing 504 acres to encroachers. He said the stock farm was only left with 562 acres.Investigations done by the Inspector General of Government (IGG) in 2014 revealed that although Njeru Town Council got a lease on the land in 1967, including plots 2,3,4 &5, the same town council, in 1969, sub-leased 306 acres to the Ministry of Agriculture [Njeru Stock Farm] out of Plot 2,3,4 & 5 for livestock purposes.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Njeru-Stock-Farm-land-woes-Authorities-ask-for-Shs1-3b/688334-5064220-7wbre2/index.html
22,Masaka residents protest new fees for grazing in forest reserves - Daily Monitor,"MASAKA. Masaka District residents have protested the revised charges levied on herders grazing their cattle in government forest reserves.The changes announced by the district forestry authorities require each cow grazed from forest reserves, including Mujuzi Forest Reserve, to pay Shs5,000, up from Shs1,000, which they have been paying monthly.However, the herdsmen have opposed the new fees, saying they are exorbitant.The most affected herdsmen are those in Diimo, Katikamu, Gayaza, Nabitaka and Byambale, among villages in Kyesiga Sub-county in Masaka District.During a crisis village meeting at Byambale Village in Kyesiiga Sub-county on Wednesday last week, the residents raised their concern over what they called exploitation by the forestry authorities.Herdsmen led by the village chairperson, Mr Baker Kalokola, claim that for long, they have been protecting the forest reserves from encroachers and land grabbers. Majority of the herdsmen here are still keeping local breeds because they don t have money to purchase and maintain hybrid heifers. So, I wonder how they will manage to pay Shs5,000 per month to feed their cattle,  he said.Also under the new arrangement, herdsmen will cease fetching firewood from the forest reserves as has been the practice.Ms Joan Namukasa, one of the affected livestock farmers, said local leaders and forestry authorities should address the problem of illegal logging in forest reserves instead of witch-hunting locals residing near forests.Livestock farmers in Bukoto Central constituency have asked their leaders, including the area legislator and Vice President Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi to intervene and ask the district forestry authorities to revise the new charges downwards.The area parish chairperson, Mr Moses Gabula, said it s unfair to charge herdsmen such money for simply grazing their cattle in forest reserves.Efforts to speak to the area forest supervisor, Mr Rogers Mwanje, were futile by press time. Grazing in forestsPermission: In the neighbouring Gomba District, National Forestry Authority permitted herders to graze in central forest reserves provided they report those who cut down trees. They are usually given a six-month grazing permit, which is renewable upon satisfactory monitoring which considers sustainable use of the reserves.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Masaka-residents-protest-new-fees-grazing-in-forest-reserves/688334-5064244-15u1qly/index.html
23,Security hunt poachers over  killing of nine Uganda Kobs - Daily Monitor,"NTOROKO. A combined force of Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) rangers and Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) are searching for suspected poachers believed to have killed nine kobs in Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve in Ntoroko District. The warden-in-charge of Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Mr Benon Mugyerwa, on Monday evening confirmed the death of the Uganda Kobs.  Yes, we found nine heads of the kobs inside Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve last week on Wednesday. The poachers had already taken the meat but we have dispatched a combined force of our rangers from our reserve and other parks together with the UPDF to hunt and arrest these poachers,  Mr Mugyerwa said.Other poaching incidents Just mid last month, court in Ntoroko District sentenced four cattle keepers for illegally grazing more than 600 cows in Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. Mr Deusdedit Twinomugisha, the assistant warden of Community Conservation at Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, said the cattle keepers have killed all the lions in the reserve because they eat their cows.  Lions are the key attraction to tourists in the park. Tourists don t want to see domestic animals in the park and they pay a lot of money to see wild animals, birds and boat cruise events,  he said. Mr Twinomugisha said the reserve receives between 500 to 700 tourists each year.  Last year, Police in Katwe-Kabatoro in Kasese District held four suspects for allegedly killing lions in Queen Elizabeth National Park.The 11 lions included three females and eight cubs, which died after suspected poisoning, at Hamukungu Fishing Village in Queen Elizabeth National Park.The management of the reserve continues to suffer challenges that include poaching, illegal grazing, poor road network to the reserve, poor community attitude towards conservation, illegal trafficking of wildlife resources and a high demand of resources from the reserve such as poles, firewood, water and grass.The reserveTooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve covers part of Ntoroko, Bundibugyo and Kabarole districts and also borders with Lake Albert. According to UWA, some of the cattle keepers were allowed to graze in the reserve during the ADF war to alert government about the rebel positions but after the insurgency in 1990s, however, the habit of grazing in the reserve continued. As early as 1913, Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve became significant for tsetse fly control programme and a lion hunting area.It was established as a Game Reserve in 1926 Under General Notice 546 aiming at the protection of the large population of wild animals of which kobs were dominant. Other games were reedbucks, waterbucks, hartebeests, lions, buffaloes, elephants, hippos and others.The reserve covers an area of 542sq, km. it is located in Western Uganda and is neighboured by 12 sub-counties.It is a habitat to a number of endangered species including the chimps in the central savanna and the River Line forest of Mugiri, Wasa, and Nyaburogo rivers. Tourists say the chimps here exhibit a number of unique features such as digging and drinking from holes even when water is available.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Security-hunt-poachers-over--killing-nine-Uganda-Kobs/688334-5064312-11ygt3f/index.html
24,"Quit if you are paid less, MP tells government teachers - Daily Monitor","NTUNGAMO. The Member of Parliament for Rushenyi County, who is also deputy Attorney General, Mr Mwesigwa Rukutana, has said teachers who are crippling the education sector over the excuse of meagre pay should quit and find other work to do.While addressing the school management committee, Parent-Teachers Association heads and teachers of Ruyonza Primary School on Monday, Mr Rukutana said he was disappointed to find out that the school has never scored good grades in Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE).He attributed the poor performance to the teachers  failure to perform their work with determination.He said government teachers should stop the tendency of complaining that they are poorly paid yet the teachers in private schools are being paid meagre salary but they are performing well. The net pay for the least paid primary school teacher in a government school is Shs420,000 per month. When I was at this school [Ruyonza Primary School] from 1967 to 1973, it was performing well but now it is a total mess,  Mr Rukutana said.Mr Rukutana is on a tour of government-aided primary and secondary schools in the constituency to assess their situation.Working togetherHe asked stakeholders to keep focused and work together to achieve better results.Ntungamo District Education Officer Arigye Odo said he would not hesitate to sack all teachers who fail to perform their duties diligently. Really we cannot tolerate this habit of continuing to perform poorly at the expense of public money, therefore, we will not hesitate to sack you if you keep doing this. Ruyonza is one of the schools that got many ungraded pupils in the district,  Mr Arigye said.The head teacher of Ruyonza Primary School, Mr Fredrick Katushabe, and other teachers pledged their commitment to work for good grades. The MP and education officials resolved to meet all parents of Ruyonza Primary School on Friday to discuss how to improve the school s performance.In the 2018 PLE, the school did not have any pupil in Division One.  There were two pupils in Division Two, 15 in Division Three, 15 in Division Four, 11 were ungraded and one was in X.

25,Dokolo patients paying to use government ambulance - Daily Monitor,"DOKOLO. Dokolo District authorities are charging residents money to use the government ambulance to transport their sick relatives to Dokolo Health Centre IV.Ms Beatrice Adongo, 34, a resident of Atabu Parish in Bata Sub-county, says she recently paid Shs80,000 to transport her expectant daughter to the health centre IV in Dokolo Town Council. The driver determines the amount of money you are supposed to pay before he comes to help you out and when you don t have the money, you can t access the ambulance,  she says. However, the in-charge of Agwata Health Centre III, Mr Roy Opio, says they always experience a big challenge with referral cases and always charge money for fuelling the vehicle.He explains that pregnant mothers seeking to use the ambulance are charged Shs20,000 when referred from Agwata health facility to Dokolo Health Centre IV, about 15kms away. Data from Agwata Health Centre III indicates that at least 50 expectant mothers visit the facility monthly. The district vice chairperson, Mr Nam Francis Ogwal, says the issue of charging patients to utilise the ambulance was brought to the attention of the district council and that it is being handled.  We are considering putting a flat rate of not more than Shs30,000 for patients to access the ambulance,  he says.Mr Eugine Odongo, the district health educator, says the district has only two ambulances. We have low budget allocation for the health department but the district has been informed that Ministry of Health is considering centralising the management of ambulances countrywide,  he says.Mr Moses Opio, a paralegal with the Uganda National Health Consumers organisation (UNHCO), says charging patients to access government ambulances deprives them their right to access quality health services.  The ambulance driver should not decide on the charges or charge patients to access the ambulance. He is a paid government worker and he is serving the taxpayers of this country,  Mr Opio says.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Dokolo-patients-paying-use-government-ambulance/688334-5064332-sw9lruz/index.html
26,"Women in Karamoja, West Nile to benefit from Shs33b project - Daily Monitor","The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations and the government have launched a $9 million (about Shs33.5 billion) project aimed at empowering rural women in Karamoja and West Nile sub-regions. The five-year project titled  Climate Resilient Livelihood Opportunities for Women Economic Empowerment (CRWEE) in Karamoja and West Nile regions of Uganda,  is funded by the government of Sweden through the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida). According to the donors, the funds will, among others, be directed towards strengthening gender responsive and climate change resilience of rural women, improving their access to and control of productive resources and improving their household income.Speaking at the launch of the project at Muni University yesterday, Mr Antonio Querido, the FAO county representative, said:  The frequent drought in different parts of the country negatively impacts on crop and livestock production and fuels the spread of diseases. This exerts more pressure on the already strained natural resources.  He observed that although 20 per cent of Uganda is covered by water resources, there is still limited investment in the infrastructure to capture and deliver water for domestic and agricultural production. FAO is targeting about 250 farmer groups, reaching 52,500 people as direct beneficiaries.Six out of every 10 beneficiaries will be women and girls. An additional 6,000 households will benefit from ecosystem management interventions such as tree planting, while at least 180 government officials from national and district levels, will receive training to empower them for gender-transformative climate change adaptation and mitigation.State minister for Northern Uganda Grace Kwiyucwiny said the project should be used to uplift the 9,000 households living below the poverty line in northern Uganda. Ms Kwiyucwiny said project implementers should identify locally-grown commodities such as cashew nuts, Irish potatoes, cassava, apiary and tree planting to promote value addition. The head of development cooperation at the Swedish Embassy in Uganda, Mr Ola H llgren, said there is a need to increase economic empowerment of rural women through support to production, productivity and productive employment in the agricultural sector, particularly in Karamoja and West Nile.  We recognise the need to address a number of bottlenecks such as the use of rudimentary tools and technology in production, impact of climate change and environmental degradation, lack of markets and market information, limited access and ownership of production assets for women and youths, limitations to financial access and vulnerabilities to shocks,  Mr H llgren said.West Nile and Karamoja sub-regions have peculiar challenges to rural development and poverty reduction. Compounded by the refugee influx in West Nile and recurrent long droughts and floods in Karamoja, it is hard for many households to sustain an agriculture-based livelihood.  Cultural leaders from the sub-region, including the Madi chief Stephen Drani and Alur King Phillip Olarker Rauni III, made a declaration to support women s access to more economic opportunities.Peculiar casesWest Nile and Karamoja sub-regions have peculiar challenges to rural development and poverty reduction.

27,School heads in Kinkiizi Diocese face demotion over poor grades - Daily Monitor,"Kanungu. Head teachers in Church of Uganda-founded primary schools in Kinkiizi Diocese that fail to register pupils in Division One this academic year will be demoted, Bishop Dan Zoreka has said. Non-performing head teachers will be demoted to classroom teachers because the diocese shall not tolerate them in the education department as team leaders. You either take charge and improve academic performance or go back to classroom as teachers. Work in silence and let success make noise,  Bishop Zoreka said yesterday.He was addressing head teachers, chairpersons of Parents Teachers Association and their school management committee chairpersons in Kanungu District.Statistics issued by Rev Stella Arineitwe, the education secretary of Kinkiizi Diocese, indicate that out of 2,475 pupils from 83-church founded primary schools in Kanungu that sat for Primary Leaving Examinations last year, only 123 passed in first grade.Mr Emmy Ngabirano, the deputy Resident District commissioner, said they are ready to support proposals on improving academic standards. The system of recycling and transferring head teachers that have failed to register pupils passing in grade one shall not be entertained. If you feel that you are tired, just request for early retirement and let people that are fresh and dynamic take the leadership positions you are currently occupying,  Mr Ngabirano said. How come Senior Four and Six dropouts teaching in private schools make pupils pass in grade one despite the small salaries they get and you that are being well paid by government fail to make it   he added.Ms Josephine Katsya, the district chairperson, said poor academic performance in government schools in the area is worrying.She said in the next 10 years, the district might not raise technical personnel to work in their own district because many students drop out of school before completing Senior Four.Mr Charles Sunday, the district education officer, warned head teachers against absenteeism, saying it interferes with the learning procedure. He wondered why teachers in government are not performing well. There is need for a by-law banning proprietors of private schools from taking away bright pupils in government schools after promising heaven and earth to their parents because such trends sabotage Universal Primary Education,  Mr Sunday said.Mr John Tereraho, an education consultant with World Vision, called for team work to improve academic performance.Mr Kenneth Tusingwire, the head teacher for Nyakatare Primary School, called for increase in teachers  welfare by providing them with meals and other incentives if performance is to improve. I worked at Kihiihi Primary School and the academic standards were the best in the district because parents agreed to raise extra money to motivate teachers. I am sure that if this is done, performance will improve,  Mr Tusingwire said.ConcernsOther head teachers cited absenteeism of pupils, teachers staying at one station for long, poor administrators, neglect by the foundation bodies, lack of staff accommodation and negative attitude on UPE schools by parents among others, as the major causes of poor performance. They suggested that sensitisation of all stake holders, especially being reminded of their respective roles would change the situation.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/School-heads-Kinkiizi-Diocese-face-demotion-over-poor-grades/688334-5063780-c1ln5h/index.html
28,Gunmen shoot two in mobile money robbery - Daily Monitor,"Two unidentified gunmen on Sunday night shot and injured two people in Mpongo Village in Mpasana Sub-county in Kakumiro District before taking off with unspecified amount of money from a mobile money agent.The men, who were riding on a motorcycle at about 10:30pm, attacked a mobile money agent whom police identified as Mr Amos Mugisha and robbed him of money and his mobile phone before they attacked another shop attendant. Mr Najib Waiswa, the district police commander, identified the injured as Mr Kussein Kasaija, 42, and Mr Posoko Sekiwere, 23, all residents of Mpongo and Mukora villages, respectively.  They pointed a gun at me and asked me to give them all the money that I had. I gave them Shs.1.3 million. They proceeded to the next shop where I heard them firing bullets,   Mr Mugisha said. Eyewitnesses say the armed men attempted to rob another businesswoman but failed.Her son, Mr Sekiwere, engaged the robbers in a scuffle prompting them to shoot him, police said. As they fled, residents mobilised and barricaded the road to prevent them from escaping but in the process, Mr Kasaija was shot.The injured were taken for first aid and later to Hoima referral hospital. Police say they have started investigating the matter.  We are in touch with local people and we shall bring the perpetrators to book,   Mr Waiswa said yesterday. In a related incident, police in Kagadi District are holding a woman and four other relatives in connection with the murder of her husband Vincent Sabimaana, a businessman in Kyabitundu Village in Rugashaali Sub-county. Sabimaana s body was found at the weekend.Police investigations and a post-mortem report shows that he was strangled to death.Mr Romeo Ojara Oneck, the district police commander, attributed the killing to domestic violence.ArrestsLast month, police said they arrested at least eight suspects in mobile money robberies and killings registered in four weeks in different districts. Police also said five suspects, who were targeting Savings and Credit Cooperative Organisations were apprehended.

29,"Help local communities benefit from tourism, experts tell government - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government should find innovative ways of helping communities around protected areas earn from tourism if they are to appreciate and protect the parks, experts have suggested.Dr Dilys Roe, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), a London-based think-tank, said if communities feel that parks do not benefit them, they resort to poaching.She made the remarks while giving a keynote address into the threats to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and some innovative ideas for new community-based solutions in Kampala last week. The lecture was organised by Aga Khan Development Network. Citing their nearly two years  experience in helping communities around Bwindi tap into tourism, Dr Roe said many people can benefit from gorilla tracking indirectly through selling items to tourists. Gorillas are key attraction in Uganda. They are particularly important because there aren t many countries in the world where you can find gorillas. So the tourism market is here or in Rwanda,  she said.  That really sounds positive, but the other side of the story is where that money goes. Dr Roe said local communities can earn from tourism if they are trained to work as professional guides, sell food or offer authentic cultural experiences and not necessarily wait for the 10 per cent park revenue ploughed back by government. TrainingShe said IIED has already trained some residents to offer the services.Gorilla-tracking in Bwindi generates revenue for conservation, but local benefits from tourism are limited and the illegal use of the park s resources continues.Tourism is a top foreign exchange earner and Uganda last year raked in $1.4b (Shs5 trillion) from the sector, according to government statistics.Mr Amin Mawji, the Aga Khan Development Network representative in Uganda, said the lectures are aimed at creating  a space for conversation... a space for illumination where leaders and opinion formers can come together to reflect on the big issues of our time, to explore new ideas and fresh perspectives, and to promote new solutions to the problems that face us and our children. The lecture examined some of the challenges facing the tourism sector. Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, the Tourism minister, lauded the Aga Khan Development Network for organising the lecture and contributing to the development of Uganda.He said government is committed to conserving the environment but sometimes they are let down by rampant poverty among Ugandans, bad attitude and the growing population of people and animals that compete for space.The lecture was attended by Mr Daudi Migereko, the chairman of Uganda Tourist Board, several ambassadors and senior leadership of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Help-local-communities-benefit-from-tourism-experts-tell-govt/688334-5063750-gaoykg/index.html
30,"Apaa Land: Residents reject resettlement, compensation - Daily Monitor"," A section of residents occupying the disputed Apaa land bordering Amuru and Adjumani districts have rejected plans by the government to compensate and have them relocated.Government claims residents encroached on 827Sq km of gazetted former East Madi Controlled hunting area in Adjumani District.In February, Cabinet resolved to resettle victims of Apaa land conflict with building materials and money after assessing damages. According to a Cabinet memorandum, residents were to be given a package of Shs10 million, 20 iron sheets, 20 bags of cement and Shs2 million for those who do not have National Identity Cards. The processes of compensation and resettlement would be spear -headed by the Office of the Prime Minister, Lands ministry and Minister for Northern Uganda, Ms Grace Kwiyucwiny.The affected residents, however, say they will not accept any form of compensation and forceful plans to evict them from their ancestral land.Mr Sylvester Odoki, a resident of Acholi Ber Parish, says he totally disagrees with government plans to force them into accepting money and material benefits.Mr Denis Komakech, another Apaa resident, says the recent Cabinet memorandum was wrong on disclosing that only 374 families occupy Apaa land.Documents presented before Cabinet in February seen by this newspaper titled  The memorandum of Efforts to resolve the Apaa land conflict  indicated that 374 families occupy the land. A total of 206 were found to be non-violent and cooperative with government. According to the document, only 71 family heads were found with national IDs as residents of Apaa Village, Labala parish, Pabbo Sub-county in Amuru between 2013 and 2014 before the 2017 declaration of the boundary.However according to Mr Komakech, the information provided is inaccurate adding that more than 20,000 people are settling on the land.Last month, the Acholi legislators under their Umbrella body, the Acholi Parliamentary Group (APG), rejected the compensation plans.Mr Philip Okin Ojara, the APG chairperson, said the amount offered by government is too little for the residents to lose their land. Dr Daniel Komakech, the Acholi committee chairperson on Apaa land conflict, said the Cabinet resolution was made without consent from the team selected to ensure a peaceful resolution.Speaking during a meeting to discuss solutions on land conflict in Amuru and Nwoya districts at the Ker Kwaro Acholi Palace in Gulu Town on Thursday, Mr Komakech said the cabinet resolution was different from what they had discussed with the Prime Minister.In August last year, President Museveni called for the formation of an eight member committee from both Adjumani and Acholi to discuss the recommendations on ending the Apaa land impasse. The committee was headed by the Prime Minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda.However, in two meetings held between September and December last year and chaired by Dr Rugunda, the parties failed to harmonise on Mr Museveni s earlier recommendations.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Apaa-Land-Residents-reject-resettlement-compensation/688334-5062492-um0t30z/index.html
31,"Government, donors partner to restore wetlands - Daily Monitor","KABALE. The Ministry of Water and Environment with support from the World Bank Adaptation Fund through Sahara Sahel Observatory, a non-governmental organisation, has started a five-year project aimed at restoring wetlands in Maziba, Awoja and River Aswa catchment areas.Maziba catchment extends to Rubanda, Kabale, Rukiga and Ntungamo districts. Aswa stretches to districts of Kaabong, Kotido, Kitgum, Agago, Abim, Pader, Lira, Amuria, Otuke, Aleptong, Napak and Abim while Ajowa extends to Bukwo, Kween, Nakapiripiriti, Katakwi, Kumi, Serere, Soroti and Ngora districts.These three water catchment areas are alleged to have lost more than 70 per cent of the wetlands due to human intervention. While addressing the stakeholders in a meeting on Friday, Ms Annette Kezia Nantongo, a senior water officer with the Ministry of Water and Environment, said $7.75 million (about Shs29b) will be spent on the project.Ms Nantongo, who is also the project officer, said the drive aims at increasing the resilience of the surrounding communities to the risk of floods and landslides through promoting catchment based integrated, equitable and sustainable management of water and related resources. All these areas that we are targeting are prone to floods. People have depleted wetlands and the effects are visible. They are at a high risk of losing all the water resources in the area as well as facing desertification if the water catchments are invaded like they are now,  Ms Nantongo said.CoverageAwoja catchment covers 11,000 square kilometres; Aswa catchment covers 27,631 square kilometres while Maziba catchment covers 1,370 square kilometres.The project officials met district leaders, media and civil society organisations in Kabale to agree on the modalities of implementing the project in the region. District leaders, however, expressed concern that the project has up-bottom approach which may limit the impact.Kabale LC5 Patrick Besigye Kaihwa said while ministries come up with well written projects, they end up not being implemented because they lack local content. He said locals should be involved in all the processes. We want a project that shall have impact, many projects the ministries bring to us are designed and executed from the centre therefore lacking local content, the reason they at times fail. We now need to get fully involved and help our people because they are the ones affected by climate change in the end,  Mr Kaihwa said.The Ntungamo LC5 chairman, Mr Denis Singahache, who is also the chairperson of the Maziba catchment, asked the leaders in the area to embrace any project that comes to address climate change because it is negatively affecting their livelihood.Background 2013. Majority of the wetlands in Kabale District were degraded and turned into gardens and dairy farms, an official said.The then district wetlands coordinator, Mr Joseph Murangira, said the increasing population triggered the high demand for farming land.He added that soil exhaustion on hill tops and the recent introduction of tea growing in the district had escalated the situation. He said less than five wetlands out of the 72 that existed in 1980s that were in existence, adding that plans were underway to evict the encroachers.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-donors-partner-restore-wetlands/688334-5062532-132cc20/index.html

In a bid to fight illegal wildlife trade and trafficking in Queen Elizabeth and Virunga national parks, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through their wildlife authority bodies have embarked on trans-boundary collaboration to curb the vice.The wildlife authorities in Uganda include International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in partnership with the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA).IFAW is an international non-governmental organisation that protects animals and their habitants. The UWA deputy executive director, Mr George Owoyesigire, said Uganda is endowed with diverse natural resources such as wildlife, forests and wetlands, but poaching, illegal wildlife trade and habitat degradation remain threats. We have seen a serious decline in wildlife populations due to poaching and illegal wildlife trade,  he said.Mr Owoyesigire said this on Saturday at Koikoi in Fort Portal Town during a training of security and law enforcement officers within Queen Elizabeth and Virunga national parks on how to detect and combat illegal wildlife trade.He said due to the efforts, UWA with support from stakeholders are beginning to witness an increase in wild animals. For instance, elephant population decreased from 30,000 in 1960 to only 2,000 by 1983 and have since increased to 5,808 in 2017; buffalos were 60,000 in 1960 decreased to 25,000 in 1982 but have since increased to 37,054,  he said.Mr Owoyesigire said deforestation has had devastating effects on the forest cover from more than 30 per cent in 1990 to less than 9 per cent by 2019, wetland cover from more than 40 per cent in 1980 to less than 8 per cent by 2018. As a result of degradation, wild life in habitats have been destroyed, lakes have been depleted and that s the very reason we are experiencing an increase in human-wildlife conflicts, poverty and poaching as people strive to earn a living,  he said.The programmes director of IFAW, Mr Moses Olinga, said collaborating with the neighbouring country (DRC) will help in combating illegal wildlife trade easily.He said:  When animals cross from Uganda to DRC, they are killed because it is unknown where they belong. The border between Uganda and DRC has been used by poachers, and they have been killing animals from Uganda and they take them to DRC and vice versa.  He said pangolins have been the most poached animals because of their medicinal scales and therefore there is need for security agencies to get skills on how to identify scales of pangolins, skins of leopards, cheetahs, among others. People trying to smuggle chimps and other animals have been arrested at Entebbe, Jomo Kenyatta and Addis Ababa international airports  he added.Kabarole Resident District Commissioner Stephen Asiimwe appealed to UWA officials and other stakeholders to also domesticate laws such as the Wildlife Act and the constitution [explain the laws in local languages] because people are not informed.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Uganda-DR-Congo-unite-fight-illegal-wildlife-trade/688334-5062586-etnycb/index.html
33,Councillors raise queries over sold hospital equipment - Daily Monitor,"Kayunga. Councillors in Kayunga District have put the district executive committee on the spot over failure to show accountability of funds raised from the sale of old medical equipment at Kayunga General Hospital.The hospital is undergoing renovation and expansion at a cost of Shs70b. Dr Diana Atwine, the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Health, said the facility will be equipped with new machines upon completion.Although the council claims that they have not been informed about the funds raised, Mr Tom Sserwanga, the district chairperson, said about Shs210m has been collected from the exercise.Mr Jamir Ndugga, a councillor representing Kayonza Sub-county, said the district executive has utilised the funds without their approval. As council, we have not yet passed a supplementary budget to appropriate those funds, but we are shocked to learn that the executive has used it,  Mr Ndugga said at the weekend. When they wanted to sell off the medical equipment, they sought council approval, but when it comes to accountability, they dodge around, it means there is misappropriation and corruption tendencies,  he added.Some officials are also questioning the motive of the district executive to constitute another committee to handle the auctioning instead of the procurement and disposal unit. We were left out of this exercise (sale of equipment) and we are also watching from a distance,  an official from the procurement department, who preferred anonymity, said.Mr Sserwanga set up a verification team headed by Mr Charles Iga, the district fisheries officer, to dispose of the equipment.Mr Sserwanga categorised the funds from the sale as local revenue, saying they can be used in daily operations. The Shs210m is very little. We have so far used Shs42m to roof the theatre at Bbaale Health Centre IV. We wanted to do something tangible from these funds,  he said.Mr Sserwanga said they would show accountability to relevant authorities such as the Auditor General and Inspectorate of Government, adding that  we want to be as transparent as possible. Mr Benson Otim, the acting district chief administrative officer, also dismissed claims that the money had been misappropriated. Council has approved these funds to be used in fencing the district headquarters, buying furniture for the district chairperson and others,  Mr Otim said.He said the exercise is still ongoing and those who want accountability should wait for it to be concluded.Kayunga General Hospital, which was constructed in the 1970s, had never had any major renovations.Dr Sarah Opendi, the State minister for Health in-charge of General Duties, said government will delay the elevation of the hospital to a regional referral due to lack of funds. SoldSo far, the district has sold more than 700 aluminium iron sheets, hospital beds, mattresses and other equipment from the theatre among others. The renovation and expansion of the hospital is expected to be concluded by February next year.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Councillors-raise-queries-over-sold-hospital-equipment/688334-5062598-ijid1i/index.html
34,Increased  murder cases worry Bugisu  authorities - Daily Monitor,"Police and local leaders in Bugisu Sub-region have expressed concern over the increasing number of murder cases in the area.Police statistics indicate that more than 20 cases of murder were registered in Namisindwa, Manafwa, Mbale, Bududa, Bulambuli and Sironko districts between January and February this year.Police said the cases were a result of land wrangles, witchcraft, misunderstanding over inherited family property and business rivalry, among others.  We have registered a string of gruesome killings and this has caused fear among the locals. When family and clan members disagree on land and other properties, they resort to mob justice. When a family member is killed, the community also lynches culprits,  Mr Robert Tukei, the Elgon Region police spokesperson, said.He said Namisindwa tops in the cases followed by Mbale and Manafwa. Political and religious leaders, and community members should help us fight the crime in their respective districts,  Mr Tukei said.He said police have embarked on a massive community policing campaign to reduce cases of domestic violence and land wrangles. We have also intensified night patrols in all districts in the region to deal with the robbers,  he said.Police also say more than 30 cases of phone theft and 114 cases of other thefts were recorded in the two months.Mr George William Wopuwa, the Namisindwa chairperson, said they registered 20 deaths arising from either suicide or family-related murders, adding that many of the victims were more than 80 years of age. We have had community policing in many sub-counties but the trend continues. We are worried because you can t tell who is next,  he said.Mr Moses Kigai Wamoto, the Resident District Commissioner, said they started conducting joint security meetings in the district to fight the vice.Mr Wamoto, who also heads the district security committee, urged residents to use local council courts and religious leaders to resolve disputes. Mr Yasin Wabomba, the Mbale Municipal Council deputy speaker, urged police and village chairpersons to work together. Police should work with local leaders to fight crime because it is one of the causes of underdevelopment,  he said.Mr John Magomu, a resident, said perpetrators mainly target elders in order to grab their land.Past years2018: The region registered 156 murder cases, 236 for robbery, 239 for phone thefts and 1,334 for other kinds of theft  2017: Murder cases registered were 241, robberies-233, Theft of phones-261 and theft of all kinds-1526.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Increased--murder-cases-worry-Bugisu--authorities/688334-5062614-496acm/index.html
35,Police foil theft of baby at Hoima regional hospital - Daily Monitor,"Hoima. Police in Hoima District have arrested a mother who had allegedly conspired with medical personnel to steal a baby from Hoima Regional Referral Hospital. According to police, the 21-year-old resident of Kiburwa Village in Kitoba Sub-county on Saturday at around 11pm allegedly made her way into the hospital and negotiated with two nurses to have her one-week old baby girl swapped with a baby boy of the same age.A whistle-blower, who heard of the plot, notified police, leading to the woman s arrest.According to preliminary information gathered by the police, one of the nurses on duty asked for Shs300,000 to execute the plan.  However, the suspect only had Shs80,000. She paid Shs50,000 and the balance was to be paid immediately after the deal had been effected. She was immediately arrested and taken to Hoima police,  said Mr Julius Hakiza, the Albertine region police spokesperson.Police detectives later visited the hospital for evidence gathering. They then contacted her husband. We do appeal to the mothers in hospitals to always be vigilant not to lose their new born babies. There are many people with ill intentions wandering in the hospitals. Always tip the nurses so that we can apprehend the culprits,  Mr Hakiza said. The hospital director, Dr Peter Mukobi, said they have increased security at the facility to prevent future thefts.Recent caseIn July last year, a child was stolen from Hoima Regional Referral Hospital from a Rwandan refugee. According to police detectives, the refugee from Kyangwali camp delivered by caesarean section under the help of medical workers at the hospital. Shortly after delivery a nurse on duty sent one of the mother s caretaker to pick a stretcher which would be used to transport the baby and the mother from the labour ward.By the time the caretaker returned, the baby had been taken and the nurse had disappeared.

36,"Agent quizzed, Hima to hand Tororo land back to locals - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Hima Cement has agreed to hand over land around Tororo rock back to the locals in Mwello Village after conceding that the company s agent acquired the land arbitrarily. Appearing before the land probe on Thursday, the Hima Cement managing director, Mr Nicolas George, conceded that their agent Optima Mining and Minerals had been placed under investigations because everything they did in Mwello was questionable. He said in the result, they suspended the quarrying project intended to start in Mwello.Appearing before the land probe on Friday, Mr Dunstan Ndyaguma, the managing director of Optima Mining and Minerals, was advised by the commission to get a lawyer to educate him on the land tenure system around Mwello rock in Tororo. The commission s lead counsel, Mr Ebert Byenkya, said Mr Ndyaguma did not know the land tenure system in Tororo where he was hired by Hima Cement to buy surface rights for the company on a 21-year lease. Hima Cement initially avoided buying the surface rights directly because brokers would inflate the price.The commission asked Mr Ndyaguma to explain the land system around Mwello rock and he said it s Mailo. Later, he contradicted himself saying it s Private Mailo. Earlier, the commission chairperson, Justice Catherine Bamugemereire, described Mr Ndyaguma as a dangerous man in matters related to land given how he manipulated the locals.  It s questionable how a company like Hima Cement can deal with a person like you. We are going to ask Hima Cement to come and explain,  Justice Bamugemereire said. Residents accused Mr Ndyaguma of handing them large sums of money in a bid to lure them to sell their land to him. During cross-examination, Mr Byenkya said Mr Ndyaguma bought land from locals who have a permanent ownership and intended to apply for a lease on the land from Tororo District Land Board. Mr Ndyaguma was informed that for such acquisitions to be legitimate the people selling the land must have a customary certificate on the land, which was not the case. Residents of eight villages in Mwello parish want the land probe to stop Hima Cement from buying their communal land without compensation. Mr Ndyaguma concurred with the former Commissioner for Geological Surveys and Mines, Mr Edward Kato, who told the land probe that Hima Cement did not have a mining licence but a three-year exploration permit.

Since the protests erupted in December, the armed forces have remained on the sidelines even as security agents and riot police have cracked down.Demonstrators have called on the army to protect them from the deadly crackdown, after days of camping outside its headquarters, which also houses Bashir's residence and the defence ministry.Wish of the revolutionDefence Minister General Awad Ibnouf vowed that the army would prevent any slide into chaos.""Sudan's armed forces understand the reasons for the demonstrations and is not against the demands and aspirations of the citizens, but it will not allow the country to fall into chaos,"" Ibnouf said on Monday, according to the official SUNA news agency.In a separate statement, army chief of staff Kamal Abdelmarouf said the military was ""discharging its responsibility in securing and protecting citizens.""Officials say 38 people have died in protest-related violence since December.Interior Minister Bushara Juma said seven protesters died and 15 were wounded on Saturday when forces tried to disperse them.He said 42 security personnel were injured and 2,496 arrests made.The umbrella group spearheading the protests appealed to the army on Monday for talks on forming a transitional government.""We call on the Sudanese armed forces to talk directly with the Alliance for Freedom and Change for facilitating the peaceful process of forming a transitional government,"" said Omar el-Digeir, a senior member of the group.Digeir said the protest organisers had formed a council to open talks aimed at agreeing a ""transitional government that represents the wish of the revolution"".Reading from a statement, he also called on the armed forces ""to withdraw their support for a regime that has lost its legitimacy"" and to support the ""people's alternative for a transition to a civilian democratic government"".Economic mismanagement The rally outside the army headquarters has been the largest since protests began on December 19 in the central town of Atbara, quickly spreading to the capital and nationwide.The European Union said an ""unprecedented"" number of people had come out calling for change since Saturday.""The people of Sudan have shown remarkable resilience in the face of extraordinary obstacles over many years,"" the EU's External Action Service said.""Their trust must be won through concrete action by the government.""The protesters accuse Bashir's administration of economic mismanagement that has led to soaring food prices and chronic shortages of fuel and foreign currency.After a meeting chaired by Bashir on Sunday, Sudan's security council said the demands of the protesters ""have to be heard"".Bashir, wanted by the Hague-based International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide connected with the suppression of a now 16-year-old ethnic minority rebellion in the western region of Darfur, took power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.He has remained defiant, introducing tough measures that have seen protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists arrested.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Gun-fire-army-headquaters-Sudan-Omar-alBashir-protestors/688340-5063414-uk3vehz/index.html

42,Netanyahu on path for victory in Israeli election - Daily Monitor,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on path for victory in Israel's elections on Wednesday after nearly complete results put him in position to form a right-wing coalition and further extend his long tenure in office.The results from Tuesday's vote came despite corruption allegations against the 69-year-old premier and put him on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister later this year.His Likud party looked set to finish with a similar number of seats in parliament to his main rival, ex-military chief Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White alliance, Israeli media reported.But with 97 percent of the vote counted, results showed the Likud and other right-wing parties allied to him with some 65 seats in the 120-seat parliament, the reports said.The result would seem to leave President Reuven Rivlin, whose task it is to ask one of the candidates to form a government, with little choice but to pick Netanyahu.Intensive coalition negotiations are likely to follow and could drag on for days or even weeks.Final results were expected by Thursday afternoon, with ballots for soldiers and other special categories of voters yet to be counted.The close race between the two main parties had led to uncertainty after polls closed on Tuesday night and exit surveys were released.- 'Magnificent victory' -Both Netanyahu and Gantz claimed victory after the initial exit surveys that gave Blue and White the most seats.But even then Netanyahu appeared best placed to form a coalition, with both parties in any case falling far short of an outright majority.Netanyahu spoke in the early hours of Wednesday at the Likud's post-election party in Tel Aviv and called it a ""magnificent victory.""As he walked onto the stage to chanting crowds, he planted a kiss on the lips of his wife Sara.""It will be a right-wing government, but I will be prime minister for all,"" he said.Earlier while addressing cheering supporters who waived Israeli flags at an event hall in Tel Aviv, Gantz called it a ""historic day.""""The president must give us the task of forming the next government since we are the biggest party,"" he said after initial exit polls.The vote had long been expected to be close and lead to frantic negotiations to form a coalition, even with Netanyahu facing potential corruption charges.Fighting for his political life, Netanyahu spent the weeks ahead of the vote campaigning furiously to energise his right-wing base.Things can changeGantz, a newcomer to politics, mounted a strong challenge to the veteran prime minister by brandishing his security credentials while pledging to undo damage he says Netanyahu has inflicted on the country with divisive politics.The election was in many ways a referendum on the premier who has built a reputation as guarantor of the country's security and economic growth, but whose populism and alleged corruption left many ready for change.He engaged in populist rhetoric that critics said amounted to the demonisation of Arab Israelis and others.Netanyahu faced further criticism on election day when members of his Likud party brought small cameras into polling stations in Arab areas.Arab politicians called it an attempt at intimidation, while Netanyahu said cameras would prevent fraud.True to form, Netanyahu issued a deeply controversial pledge only three days before the election, saying he planned to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should he win.Extending Israeli sovereignty on a large scale in the West Bank could be the death knell to already fading hopes for a two-state solution with the Palestinians.It is a move long championed by Israel's far right.King Bibi Netanyahu sought to portray himself as Israel's essential statesman in the run-up to the vote and highlighted his bond with US President Donald Trump.He spoke of Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and of Israel's claim of sovereignty over the annexed Golan Heights.He also used Trump-like tactics, calling the corruption investigations a ""witch hunt"" and denouncing journalists covering them.On Tuesday, he continually warned the Likud was at risk of losing as a result of what he said was low turnout among supporters, claims widely seen as a bid to motivate right-wing voters.Turnout was 67.9 percent compared to 71.8 percent in the last election in 2015.Gantz, a 59-year-old former paratrooper, invoked the corruption allegations against the premier to make his case that it is time for him to go.He called Netanyahu's annexation pledge an ""irresponsible"" bid for votes.Gantz said he favoured a ""globally backed peace agreement"" with Israel holding on to the large West Bank settlement blocs, adding that he opposed unilateral moves.He sought to overcome Netanyahu's experience by allying with two other former military chiefs and ex-finance minister Yair Lapid to form his alliance.Netanyahu has been premier for a total of more than 13 years.But ""King Bibi,"" as some have called him, now faces the prospect of becoming the first sitting prime minister to be indicted.The attorney general has announced he intends to indict Netanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust pending an upcoming hearing.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Netanyahu-victory-Benny-Gantzs-Israeli-election-Israeli/688340-5064858-12ngqwx/index.html
43,Bouteflika ally named Algeria's first new president in 20 years - Daily Monitor,"Algerian lawmakers appointed a regime stalwart as the country's first new president in two decades Tuesday, dismaying protesters seeking sweeping change following the resignation of veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The election of upper house speaker Abdelkader Bensalah as interim president follows constitutional rules but goes against the demands of demonstrators, who have pushed for him and other top politicians to stand down.""I want to work towards fulfilling the interests of the people,"" Bensalah, a trusted ally of Bouteflika, told parliament on taking up the 90-day interim presidency.""It's a great responsibility that the constitution demands of me,"" the 77-year-old added.Opposition parties refused to back the appointment of the seasoned establishment insider and boycotted the session, as thousands of students protested against him in Algiers.""Resign Bensalah!"" they chanted, clutching hand-written placards and Algerian flags.For the first time in seven weeks police in the capital fired tear gas to try to disperse the protest by students, who were also hit with water cannon.On Friday -- in the first weekly mass protest since Bouteflika announced his departure after losing the military's support -- Algerians demanded regime insiders be excluded from the political transition.Ahead of the parliamentary session, an editorial in pro-government daily El Moudjahid on Tuesday suggested Bensalah should step aside from the presidential post.He is ""not tolerated by the citizen movement, which demands his immediate departure,"" or by the opposition and various political groups in both houses of parliament, the newspaper said.- 'Voice of the people' -Three men in particular have drawn demonstrators' ire: Bensalah, the head of the constitutional council Tayeb Belaiz and prime minister Noureddine Bedoui.The protest movement is calling for a new transitional framework that is committed to deep reforms and organising free elections.Ahead of Bensalah's appointment, calls continued for the speaker to step down.""He has to resign, it's the voice of the people and the people must be right,"" said 50-year-old Mourad, an entrepreneur who will protest Friday with his two young daughters.""They don't know that there's democracy... I want to teach them what freedom is,"" he added.Algerians of all ages have rallied since late February against Bouteflika, who resigned a week ago after efforts to appease demonstrators proved fruitless.Although the 82-year-old's resignation was celebrated by protesters, they have remained firm in pushing for a wider overhaul of the political system.Human Rights Watch said Bouteflika's departure is ""at most a first step in ending autocratic rule.""""During any transitional phase, authorities should fully respect the rights of Algerians to speak, assemble and associate with one another,"" the watchdog said in a statement.Demonstrators in huge numbers have defied a protest ban in Algiers, and HRW on Tuesday called on authorities to overhaul laws ""on association and assembly that stifle rights.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Bouteflika-ally-named-Algeria-s-first-new-president-20-years/688340-5063880-euwet5/index.html
44,Dedicated to pupils with special needs - Daily Monitor,"Maria Nansubuga Galiwango was supposed to be a journalist. That is what she longed for as a child. She thought that each of her days would be filled with an adventure of travelling to new places.Instead, after completing Senior Four, her elder brother encouraged her to become a teacher because of her love for children. That was the turning point as Nansubuga joined Gaba Teachers College where she graduated with a certificate in primary school teaching. It was the beginning of the journey into the unknown. She got a job at a school that she never thought would change her life forever.Tough startIn 2012, Nansubuga joined Hill Preparatory School, Naguru, kickstarting her journey in teaching.  I was given an inclusion class but that was a big challenge,  the 32-year-old said.An inclusive class has learners with disabilities and special education learning alongside their non-disabled peers. I had no interest at first. I was even afraid but after prayer I realised that this was a special group of people God had allowed me to reach,  Nansubuga recalls.As we sat for the interview, the love from the children was evident. A couple of them played with her while some hugged her, interrupting the session at several stages.Getting into the grooveA multi-talented teacher, Nansubuga later completed her diploma at Uganda Martyrs University-Nkozi in 2015 courtesy of the school director Clare Wavamunno and head teacher Ambrose Kibuuka. She attended several school trainings at Lugogo in Kampala which were regularly organised by Special Olympics Uganda as well as Umoja Global Community Music Therapy. The British Council also offered her an opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom in 2014 during an exchange programme to improve her skills of teaching special needs children.  I picked interest in furthering my knowledge of special needs education because I found these children amazing. They are so loving and I started seeing Jesus in them,  she said.Another dimensionNansubuga who teaches English and Mathematics, currently conducts private lessons at the convenience of the parents  homes for the last one year.Although she left Hill last year, she still goes there to conduct swimming lessons on a private arrangement.Nansubuga said she is now married to teaching even though she opted to start her private classes which she says offered her greener pastures. There are some parents who are still not comfortable bringing their special needs children in public and I find that an opportunity to reach out to them and help them develop,  she said.Nansubuga said she chose that approach because it is exciting yet she has a passion for seeing children with special needs excel. For special needs children, there s something new everyday, she says. They are fun and can be a challenge sometimes especially children with intellectual disabilities but we get to know each other. Nansubuga believes a good special needs educator is someone who has a passion for what they teach, and who you teach.  Being flexible and passionate is something I take pride in as an educator. I constantly talk to them to be able to build self-esteem. She was forced into swimming to tame autistic children who are normally hyper, especially after lunch making it necessary to curb extra energy.The common intellectual disability cases she has handled include; autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Each of those cases are handled differently and that is the best lesson I have learned in life. Everyone is different from the other,  she notes, adding that loving such children is what makes us human.Moving onNansubuga agrees that she cannot get all the money she needs from teaching as such she handles different projects. After opting to leave Hill Preparatory School last year, she joined Kampala International Pre-School in Naguru before she settled at Bourneville International School. She supplements this by working in a network marketing company, Success, which deals in cryptocurrencies. I do personal work with Success online and I never have to worry about my teaching appointments,  she says about her balancing act.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Dedicated-pupils-with-special-needs/688336-5060824-glwrmwz/index.html
45,NTCs should offer computer courses - Daily Monitor,"Despite computer being one of the subjects taught in schools today, several National Teacher s College (NTCs) across the country do not conduct these courses for their students. As such several stakeholders in the education sector have called on the Education ministry to consider having in place computer courses to produce teachers who can impart computer education to the learners. Last year, National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), recommended that computer studies must be taught at both O and A-Level.In fact Denis Tabo, a former student of Gulu Central High School told Daily Monitor that limited access to computer labs, and lack of computer books was the reason why students performed dismally in computer exams in the 2018-2019 national exams. We used to access computer lab twice a week for only 80 minutes a day which is not enough for a student to practice,   he said. He also cited lack of computer books that has made most of the students fail the theory part of the computer exams due to limited books in various schools. But Michael Okidi, the head teacher Layibi High School, advised schools to take up computer lessons when they already have in place enough computers and well-trained computer teachers. Lack of professional teachers is forcing us to hire anybody with a Bachelors in Computer Science some of whom are not equipped with the right knowledge of teaching students,  he said. Charles Nyakito, the principal Unyama NTC, said computer studies are not yet in their curriculum.  We have been advocating for Kyambogo University to substitute Typewriting course with computer studies but we are not yet successful,  Nyakito said. Currently, only Business Education students at Unyama NTC are taught computer, which is a small group,  he adds.Decrying the status quo, Ronald Lukyamuzi, the vice chairman Information and Communication Technology Teachers Association of Uganda, said most of the members of the association are not professional teachers but university ICT and Computer Science graduates.  Government should also equip all the schools teaching computer studies with computers. Most schools have only about five computers which are shared by 60 students and no projector to support teachers in class,  he said. Computer studies were included in secondary school syllabus to encourage practical work and skills to allow students to accommodate the changing technologies in ICT.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/NTCs-should-offer-computer-courses/688336-5060874-jfktjhz/index.html
46,"I do not regret becoming a teacher, despite poor pay - Daily Monitor","Teachers complain about little pay and in fact this has discouraged a number of people from joining the profession. Not for Joviah Nyakwera. The teacher is proud of her choice of profession. Nyakwera describes her 12-year experience in teaching as an amazing journey, which she would love to end only on retirement. A number of teachers are in the profession but do not like their work. I am grateful for what I am. Through teaching I have been exposed to people from different walks of life and I have been able to influence their lives positively,  she says. Born to Yofesi Ndoleriire of Rubona Bunyangabu, Nyakwera says she was inspired to join the profession by her parents who were both teachers.She recalls being taught while at home something she attributes her love for teaching to.  I always spare time to revise with my children. This helps me discover their strengths but also weaknesses in learning,  she says.Nyakwera joined school in 1989 at Rubona Primary School and after completing Primary Seven, she joined Kahinju Secondary School in Fort Portal for O-Level.While at Kahinju, she was drawn further to teaching after seeing the commitment and selfless attitude that her teachers displayed. My teachers were a great inspiration. Some would even sacrifice their leisure time just to give us extra lessons on hard concepts which we would not have grasped during lessons,  she says adding that this selfless attitude is what has made some teachers influential people.In 2000, Nyakwera joined Progressive Secondary School, Wandegeya for A-Level with History, Economics, Geography and Divinity as her subject combination.She later enrolled for a Bachelors of Arts in Education at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. This was a dream come true considering she was enrolling for a course that she had longed to pursue.In 2004, after her graduation, Nyakwera started her teaching journey at Kaboyo Secondary School in Kabarole District. She was not employed on fulltime basis but it did not stop her from doing her job well.  I used to wake up early in the morning and be at school on time regardless of the little pay I was getting,  she recalls. In all this, her joy was seeing her students excel and move on to the next level. Diversifying She was at Kaboyo until 2010 when she was transferred to Kibiito Senior Secondary School to teach History and Divinity in Senior Four and Senior Six.She wanted to diversify. And so she applied to become an examiner for Senior Four History at Uneb in 2009. This is a decision Nyakwera does not regret. She says becoming an examiner has helped her learn many ideas thus helping her get more students to pass her subject.  I have learnt how they mark at Uneb and what they consider during marking,  she notes. In 2012, Nyakwera was transferred to Nyarukoma Secondary School in Kyenjonjo District as a teacher on government payroll. She was there for two years until the administration of Kibiito Secondary School asked for her services again. In 2014, she returned to Kibiito Secondary School but alongside teaching, she became the senior woman. This, she says, made her realise that students have several issues that teachers need to address so that they are nurtured and attain a holistic education. Students have so many issues that affect their daily lives. They range from physical, social to physiological. If not addressed, it becomes hard for the students to perform well. Important to note is that as teachers, we have a big role to play in these student s lives since we spend a lot of time with them, compared to their parents,  she explains.Growing careerNyakwera is now the deputy head teacher in charge of general duties at the school. Despite teaching the candidate classes, she spares time to interact with the students and through this, she finds out the major challenges that are affecting students and finds possible ways to solve them. To get expertise on this, Nyakwera has enrolled for a Masters in Counselling Psychology at Uganda Martyrs University, Nkozi. To her, a good teacher is supposed to provide counselling and guidance to the students.Asked about some of the challenges affecting the teaching profession, Nyakwera says the greatest is teachers who join the profession as the last option, as well as businessmen who open schools and have led to unhealthy competition among schools. These business people are not interested in the kind of students their school churns out. They are only interested in instant results so as to attract more numbers in their schools. This has led to high level of malpractices in schools,  she observes.Nyakwera says for a teacher to excel in teaching, they need to be selfless, patient, hardworking and committed. And athough the salary may not be that much, she say there is nothing as gratifying as a teacher seeing their students excelling in future.Voices Nyakwera is a teacher that is very determined to get results. She is good at engaging parents so as to make sure that her students get help both at home and at school. Gwendolyn Kanyomozi, teacher She is self-driven and patient with her students. She is also a good counsellor who always engages students to make sure they are on the right track. Moses Rubalema, lecturer, Mountains of the Moon University She is strict and does not tolerate laziness. But it is her being strict that has modelled me into what I am today. She does not want to see any of her students fail.

47,Ensure you enrol for a course you won t regret - Daily Monitor,"In 2016, Makerere University students protested the institution s decision to scrap 32 courses. The affected students complained that the decision would affect their chances at gainful employment in the competitive job market. Commenting on the institution s decision, Prof John Ddumba Ssentamu, the vice chancellor of Makerere University then, said some of the courses were merged, dropped totally or restructured to give holistic training to students. He added that students must understand that curriculums are always reviewed. And while Makerere was restructuring courses, in Mukono at Uganda Christian University, some new courses were being introduced. According to Ivan Naijuka, the university spokesperson at the time, the decision to review their curriculum to include new courses was because the institution aims at giving their graduates a competitive advantage in the job market.  The need to train professionals who are whole in the sense of knowledge, integrity as well as stewardship directed the institution s decision to include new courses,  he said. But with the various changes in courses of study at our institutions, what should inform one s choice  PassionSolomon Eriatu, a former student at Kampala International University, says he had always been passionate about journalism and when it was time for him to join university, he could not look any further than a course which would offer him the much desired training. And so Eriatu enrolled for Mass Communication.  I am an extrovert and sociable person and basing on those character traits and my passion for news reporting, I decided to join journalism class. My role models are all media people and I had been practising how to write stories since primary school.  Similarly, Judith Akwelele enrolled for a Bachelors in Child Development because of her love for children.  I could not have opted for any other course as my passion for children in unrivalled. And contrary to popular belief, I had high grades that are synonymous with those who enrol for courses such as Law. At least I felt happier than my colleagues doing Law because they were influenced by their parents,  she says. InspirationOften times, students envision a conducive and favourable working environment ready to embrace them after university through the eyes of their role models. Sean Rukundo, a graduate of Procurement and Logistics, currently a CIPS student at Uganda Management Institute, says he was inspired to study procurement and logistics because of his father s success.  Having seen my father move through the ranks in a government ministry s department of procurement, I was inspired to pursue the same course. I envisioned a job market in favour of procurement officers. Unfortunately, times are dynamic and I have not been able to find a stable,  narrates Rukundo. Money factorDespite her passion for Law, 43-year-old Mary Ouma, enrolled for Bachelor of Arts in Education because she was getting government sponsorship on the latter at Makerere University.  The high tuition fees for law school left me with no option but to venture into teaching. Fortunately, I have grown to love the profession. And luckily the job market is very favourable for my kind even with the changing times,  she says. GradesAlthough some are driven by passion, others are forced to choose certain courses by their scores in national examinations. For instance Martin Kaganzi s dream of joining journalism class still remains a dream.  I was given Public Administration at Kyambogo University as my 14 points at UACE could not allow for Journalism,  he shares. Some students opt for certain courses after getting intimidated out of the ones they have been admitted to. Most universities give students a window of two weeks to if they are to switch. Akwelele reveals that some of her peers joined Child Development course because they thought it would be easier for them to pass and be free from retaking papers. Similarly Sheila Alupot, a third year student of Nkumba University switched from Mass Communication to Bachelors of Social Work and Social Administration after feeling overwhelmed.  The multiple theories and numerous fieldwork assignments in the Journalism class scared me,  she says. According to Doreen Metta, a lecturer at St Lawrence University, students need to get career guidance.  Students who receive career guidance are well equipped with the knowledge of which courses to study.  Metta encourages both teachers and parents to be involved in providing the rightful career guidance to their children so that by the time they get to university, they are sure of what they want to pursue.  Parents should be involved in exposing their children to different materials and practices that will help them make their choices. Understand your child s interest in say; medicine, and allowing them to interface with medical persons as well as be exposed to hospital environments,  she advises.WHAT THE STUDENTS SAY I enrolled for a Journalism course because I had always admired being a presenter either on television or radio but because I encountered a lot of challenges getting into that field, I got demotivated and now I just write.  Kezia Koburungi, Mass Communication student KIU We live in a world of technology and innovations.

48,"Networking, easy way of growing career - Daily Monitor","For your career to take off, you will need the help of people who will avail opportunities, know-how and connections. Just like a popular quote by American businessman and media magnate Sumner Redstone states:  If you never venture beyond what you know... You have spawned your own limitations.  To grow your professional relationships, start with the people you already know; your family and friends who will eventually introduce you to their family and friends, which will continuously expand your networking circle to a level that is satisfactory to you. Although networking might be difficult for naturally introverted people, they must make an effort to go out and meet new people because that is one way in which careers and businesses are built. TV personality, fashion designer and host of the popular Kwivuga Poetry Sessions, Nunu Umuringa Butare s career is an embodiment of the power of networking. As a social entrepreneur, her business depends on the good will of as many people as possible.  I was lucky to realise that one cannot grow or succeed in a vacuum so I set out to meet as many people as possible and make meaningful connections. I attend every event I am invited to, offer help whenever I am called upon, and treat every connection with as much respect as possible,  she says. Breaking barriersNetworks have the power to break barriers and establish the most unlikely relationships. Edwin Musiime, the NTV Property Show presenter, says he has entered the House of Lords, accessed the United States White House relying on the power of networks.  I always say that our networks determine our net worth. The power of networking has enabled me attain high levels of leverage across all spheres of influence. The Bible says iron sharpens iron; people make you a better, wiser and stronger person  Musiime reveals. Networks also help influence decision, avail mentors, life coaches and role models that are very essential for both business and career growth. As Musiime says, we are always five people away from the person we want to meet the most in the universe; someone you know might know someone who knows someone else, who knows that person you believe has the power to change your life forever.  One of my role models and personal mentor is Vusi Thembekwayo who is regarded as the world s youngest and most impressive public speaker and I met him through my vast connections. I can testify that meeting him changed my life in all ways; financially, emotionally and spiritually,  adds Musiime.Nourish relationshipsLike all relationships in life, networks need to be cultivated and nurtured or they die off. Public relations specialist Muhereza Kyamutetera avers that networks need reciprocity and integrity to flourish.  In life, we all look for relationships that benefit us either financially, emotionally or intellectually. We, therefore, seek to make connections with people that are likely to fulfill those desires. Likewise, people are drawn to us because of what they think we can do for them. So meeting these expectations is important,  Kyamutetera opines. He further recommends treating every individual relationship with the utmost importance and respect. Join an associationMost professions have an association or union that brings people together. Wilson Kutegeka, the chief executive officer of ClinicMaster, is a member of the Information and Communications Technology Association of Uganda (ICTAU).  I have benefited through connections with international organisations such as the Netherlands Trust Fund which helped develop ClinicMaster to suit international standards thus getting us clients from all over the East Africa region. This would have been a very expensive and strenuous task had I undertaken it on my own,  Kutegeka shares.

49,Suicide: What is plaguing university students  - Daily Monitor,"On March 21, 2019 Ugandans woke up to news that Arthur Basalirwa, a student of Makerere University Business School (MUBS), had committed suicide. A few hours before his death, Basalirwa had posted on one of his social media accounts saying,  I am sorry but it s too late, I m sorry too much weighing on me, I do not want to live to see another day. Basalirwa had posted several other statements on social media earlier in the month which friends were later to realise were revelations that he was going through tough times but did not think deeply about them until they learnt about his death.In September 2018, Joshua Ajuna was found dead in his room in Nsibirwa Hall at Makerere University. Next to his body was a bottle of suspected poison and two suicides notes. According to the notes, personal reasons had driven Ajuna to kill himself. Earlier in April 2011, Francis Kigenyi, 23, had jumped to his death from the fifth floor of Baskon hostel on Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road in Kampala. Before his death, Kigenyi had told guests at his birthday party that his life was worthless and referred to himself as a ghost.Yet Joshua Nuwasasira, 22, a second-year student of Makerere University Business School, Mbarara study centre had in 2012, also committed suicide after he apparently spent every penny of his tuition fees on drinking and partying. He was found hanging in his rented room in Nkokonjeru, Mbarara.These are some of the suicide cases that have been reported at universities over the years, making the situation worrying. What could drive a student who is largely dependent on their parents to take their own life  DepressionAccording to Margaret Kyosaba Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, the main reason for suicides among university students is depression. She says this depression in most cases arises from maladjusted relationships, financial challenges, stress, academic anxiety, low self-esteem, drug abuse, poor performance, career indecision, uncertainty about post-school life and other informational needs. I have had chance to interact with some students who are contemplating suicide; most of them feel as though there is no way out of their situation. They are bombarded with feelings of hopelessness, fear, isolation, hatred toward themselves and so much more. The pain they feel is often immeasurable, to a point where they see no other option but to end their lives,  she explains.How can you tell Jean Nuwagaba, the head of counselling department Kyambogo University, says when a student is depressed, they may show signs of being overly sensitive to how they are perceived by others, their failures, and their relationships. They will also show signs of hopelessness, helplessness, unexplained fear of people, places, events, or objects (phobias), escapism, and general unusual or unacceptable behaviour such as drug abuse and unwarranted sexual escapades. She says sometimes some of these people overuse defense mechanisms such as denial, blame, and projection which are also indicative of mental health issues.Nevertheless, Nuwagaba says a student in such a state can get assistance through psychological interventions such as counselling, guidance, and other forms of psychosocial support.  Extreme cases should be taken to clinical psychologists or psychiatrists for further treatment,  she says.Sometimes students get depressed but fail to get anybody to talk to yet counsellors say talking can go a long way in helping one overcome painful circumstances.University intervention Ritah Namisango, the spokesperson Makerere University, says Makerere University (Mak) has a functional Counselling and Guidance Centre. The Mak Counselling and Guidance Centre is headed by a manager who is supported by professional counsellors. The managers and counsellors are fulltime members of staff at the university. The centre provides professional counselling services to both students and staff and the services are available to help students deal with and solve challenges of living that would otherwise affect their academic achievement and their wholesome being in general. She explains that the centre handles issues such as academics; for instance failure to understand or conceptualise what is taught and failure to make the required grades. It also handles psychological problems such as sexual dysfunctions, family problems, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, bereavement, and love relationships such as being dumped by a lover, failure to relate with a lover or other people, failure to quit an oppressive relationship, as well as psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, drug addiction, sexual harassment, HIV/Aids counselling.Apart from providing students with career guidance, the guidance and counselling unit provides first year students with a fresher s orientation where they explain to new entrants the dos and don ts of university life. During this fresher s orientation week, we give every new student at Makerere University an instruction booklet, which is meant to guide them on their life at university,  she says. This, she explains, is to minimise cases of transitional challenges.But Namisango is quick to note that the attendance of these guidance and counselling services is voluntary.At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.Luckily, she adds that the unit has handled quite a number of depression cases among students so far.  Ever since the inception of this facility, we have tried to popularise our services among students, by distributing flyers to students, notices on noticeboards around the university and making outreaches in student hostels,  she explains.Why are students adamant Unfortunately, some students are not embracing counselling and guidance services yet. According to Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, though universities have created counselling departments, some students are still skeptical to go in for these services. She says some are afraid of being seen by their peers obtaining such services. It is unfortunate that though counselling is very vital for university students, some find it uncalled for and shaming,  she says, adding that for this reason at Kyambogo, they have started online counselling services to help students who would prefer online to physical meetings. Namisango also admits that though the counselling services are free, some students opt out since they are not compulsory. Way forward Biribonwa says it is high time university students accepted that everyone gets depressed at some point in their lives. However, how long it lasts is one of the key factors to determine the severity.  If depression has lasted for more than two weeks and it is affecting your day-to-day life, it is time to get treatment,  she advises.Biribonwa insists that there is absolutely no shame in getting help adding that it is important for any student who is depressed to talk to friends and open up honestly about their feelings.  If you are feeling down, tell them that. If you need someone to talk to, tell them that, too. You might be surprised by how willing they are to help you get through it,  she advises.InterventionsStudent mentors. At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services. She adds that the unit has handled quite a number of cases among students so far.Counselling unit.

50,Why you need to check that school before sending your child there - Daily Monitor,"There are a number of advertisement activities that schools engage in to attract students which sometimes do not replicate what is on the ground. And a lot of times, some aspects which may impact on your child negatively might be happening at their school behind your back. Agnes Mweteise, was two years ago convinced to take her daughter to a school in Mbarara. She was largely excited about the school s performance in that year s O-Level results that were advertised extensively in the media.But a year after, the school s performance was different and a parent had raised the issue on how the administration always advertises wrong results to dupe them about the performance.  We were surprised when one of us armed with results from the newspaper cuttings found that they were not similar to those of Uganda National Examinations Board. The one advertised in the newspaper showed they had 10 students in Division One while those of UNEB showed that the school had got none,  said Mweteise who withdrew her daughter immediately. Milton Batekateka, a retired primary school teacher, blames the liberalisation policy in education and inadequate inspection, saying education officers should be keen on whatever material schools advertise in media. Mbarara district education officer, Gabriel Ahimbisibwe, warned that schools which dupe parents risk being de-registered and administrators arrested.  Any school found to be engaging in this practice will be de-registered. It is a very bad and dangerous strategy of attracting students,  says Ahimbisibwe. Low school charges Some schools charge rather very low school fees but are these commensurate to the services or what a student or pupil needs for his career development and social welfare Laban Kanywa, the chairperson Federation of Non State Institutions in Western Uganda, says parents should interest themselves in schools that charge very low school fees especially on how they go about the costs of running these schools. Those charging very low fees are only interested in the numbers but not in the standard of education. It is these schools where teachers are not paid or are unprofessional or starve students,  says Kanywa. Every TV, radio station and newspapers at the beginning of the school s term are awash with advertisements of schools. Adverts such as  we have professional staff, science laboratory, well-stocked library, swimming pool, and balanced diet , among others are common but as a parent do you take a step further to investigate whether these actually exist Andrew Kankiriho noted that the commercialisation of education has driven schools to employ all tricks to attract students. One of the schools here in Mbarara even duped the President. It claims to teach science and technology but when the President was going to visit the school, they hired old computers, welding and fabrication machines, sewing machines and forged a workshop, imagine,  said Kankiriho. He challenges parents to always do ground check on schools before enrolling children but added that even after they enrol, parents should always check on the capacity of the school to meet their expectations. Emotional violenceUnlike other forms of violence, emotional violence does not leave physical scars but wounds the heart which lowers one s esteem, dignity, and self-worth. It includes constant belittling, shaming, humiliating, negative comparisons, and frequent yelling and bullying. Nathan Mugume, the head teacher Mbarara Junior School, admits this kind of violence exists in schools and it has very disastrous effects even to a nation; such as having a violent nation. If a teacher is violent, abusive to pupils they may grow up to have violent and abusive families. As teachers we should guide, counsel, discuss and show empathy to pupils because we can either kill or build their future,  says Mugume.He says parents need to always interest themselves in checking their children s behaviour but also monitor the behaviour of school managers and staff towards the pupils.Third partiesDue to commercialisation of education, competition has forced schools to hire private brokers and agents who comb areas looking for students while spreading the  excellence  gospel of the schools.Unsuspecting parents easily get convinced by these brokers, forgetting that these are only interested in getting paid and whatever happens after is none of their business.  During our days, competition was driven by performance but now it is about the numbers you can attract just for economic gain. Why do you employ brokers if your school is sending pupils to first class institutions with good courses   Esau Muhangi, a retired secondary school teacher, asks.This is where the trouble lies. Pupils are in schools not just to learn but also make business for the proprietor.In case you check... Security. The general security at the school and in the neighbourhood should be safe. Care. Some teachers do not have proper handling of students even when they are disciplining them. Ability to teach. This is not just about having professional teachers but those who are able to teach.Hygiene. Are the toilets, latrine, kitchen, dining area and classrooms in good condition  Behaviour. The behaviour of students in a given school can give you a picture of whether it is a good school or not. Plans. Ask about the future plans of the school, especially if the school is new or just building up momentum.Performance. Consider student performance, not just in P7, S4 or S6, but the other classes too.Games. Ensure that the school pays attention and develops learners through co-curricular activities.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Check-that-school-before-sending-your-child-there/688336-5060788-hpnsow/index.html
