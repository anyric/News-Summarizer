1,Australia election stokes mistrust in opinion polls - Daily Monitor,"The failure of opinion polls to tip a conservative win in Australia's elections has raised questions about their credibility just years after similar errors in forecasting Brexit and Donald Trump's victory in the US.Australia's ruling Liberal-National coalition claimed a shock victory in Saturday's election, after two years of trailing the opposition Labor Party in every major national poll.The polls showed a slight tightening between the two main parties with Labor ahead roughly 51-49 just before the election.The tentative result, pending final results from the Australian Electoral Commission, shows the coalition instead ahead 51-49 on Monday.""Why did we have such an amazing sequence of polls in a row that all got the same (results) "" Australian polling analyst Kevin Bonham told AFP of the years of polling that pointed to a Labor victory.Most media routinely rely on polls -- surveys of hundreds, sometimes thousands of voters by phone or online -- to flag political trends and tip the leading candidates.But question marks were raised about their accuracy in 2016 after the failure to forecast Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's triumph in the US presidential election.In Australia, political polling has had a good record, and is so closely followed in Canberra that a string of prime ministers were dumped by their own parties over the past decade over poor showings in surveys.Traditionally, pollsters contacted voters using extensive landline lists, such as the phone book. But with voters ditching landlines, it is become more difficult for pollsters to collect an accurate representative sample of the electorate.Bonham said signs polling was becoming less accurate had emerged at the state level, particularly ahead of regional elections in Victoria state in November which failed to capture a strong swing to the incumbent Labor government.""It's become increasingly harder to actually just find where a telephone number is and therefore design an efficient sample,"" Martin O'Shannessy, the ex-chief of major Australian pollster Newspoll, told AFP.""This is being faced by the whole research industry and what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg.""Pollsters have also turned to cheaper forms of collecting opinions, such as robocalls and online surveys, which experts say are significantly less accurate.O'Shannessy said the key problems that emerged from the polls of the 2016 US elections were similar.""The good quality polls, which did the best job that they could have sampling... and used human operators, generally got the answer right. However they were only 12 percent of all the polls,"" he said.""The other 88 percent were online (polls), robopolls... the average error for those polls was five percent and the biggest error was 10 percent.""One alternative method of sampling voters has been through social media.In Australia, Griffith University data scientist Bela Stantic said he accurately predicted Trump's win, Brexit and the conservatives' win on Saturday by analysing millions of social media comments.He told news.com.au he was successful as he had used large sample sizes -- some two million ""relevant"" tweets from around half a million accounts.O'Shannessy said to make news polls more accurate, Australia's market research sector was lobbying for access to the government's Integrated Public Number Database (IPND), which contains all listed and unlisted telephone numbers and is used by emergency services and law enforcement.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Australia-election-opinion-polls-Brexit-Donald-Trump/688334-5123084-1svn26/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post1.png
2,Shimoni relocation was timely - developer - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. It was time for the relocation of Shimoni Demonstration Primary School to pave way for development in the city, Mr Rajiv Ruparelia, Mr Sudhir Ruparelia s son, has said.Mr Rajiv made the remarks yesterday shortly after the official opening of Kingdom Kampala Shopping Mall on Nile Avenue. Shimoni served its purpose. However, it was whether to leave Kampala underdeveloped or developed. As urbanisation takes shape, a lot of changes happen and this goes hand in hand with the growing population,  he said. When Shimoni was here (Nile Avenue), Kampala s day population was about one million people but now the number has increased to about four million people. So how do you accommodate these people  Where do they work   he asked.Mr Rajiv said as the city expands, schools can be established in growing suburbs to avoid pressure, especially in the city centre where many changes are inevitable. His comment was in response to Daily Monitor s question on whether they have no regrets for displacing a school which offered education services to Kampala s children from the urban poor.ControversyBoth the teachers college and the primary school were controversially demolished ahead of the 2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting where government sought to build a five-star hotel to accommodate dignitaries. Both facilities were later relocated to Kira, Wakiso District. Mr Rajiv said the 13-floor building targets multinational companies, the middle-income group, government ministries and departments, and the oil and gas sector as their tenants.The mall will have a restaurant, hotel, office space, a parking space of 500 cars, among others.Asked whether they are not worried of the low occupancy rate which many city buildings are grappling with, Mr Rajiv said as the city grows, so is the pressure on the available space hence the only remedy is towering structures.Mr Christopher Higenyi, the architect of the mall, said the designs were inspired by the demand by corporate companies whom he said want a serene environment. Even when multinationals are looking for office space, they need space that matches international standards. However, much of the designs on this mall are made of our local products such as back cloth. This mixture makes it a beautiful place and we are happy that it has improved the city s skyline,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Shimoni-relocation-was-timely-developer/688334-5122552-cl4hf0/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post2.png
3,"State agents killing leaders, says Nantaba - Daily Monitor","Kampala. The gunmen killing notable Ugandans are not agents of Allied Democratic Front (ADF) rebel group as police previously said, but assassins from state security organs, the Minister of State for ICT, Ms Idah Nantaba, has said.Addressing a congregation at Bukolooto Seventh Day Adventists Church in Kayunga Town at the weekend, Ms Nantaba said the  truth is that the killers are within security and government. The masterminds, she said, were highly-placed government and security officials who are  untouchables,  a moniker in Uganda s politics to individuals who orbit in the highest circles of government and state.  As Ugandans, we have more than 10,000 questions on who is choosing which Ugandan to kill like chicken. I was going to be the next, but God saved me,  Ms Nantaba said in reference to the March 24 incident in which police shot dead a one Ronald Ssebulime on allegations of trailing the minister.The Force later recanted its earlier narrative that the deceased was armed and killed in firefight, admitting that its officers killed the 40-year-old widower, then a resident of Wakiso District, in cold blood while on his way to visit his two daughters at St Andrew s SS Kabimbiri in Kayunga District.It remains unclear whether Ms Nantaba, also the Kayunga District Woman MP, who was the main complainant in the case, ever recorded a statement with police on Ssebulime s killing after she spurned initial police summons to do so, claiming President Museveni had instructed her to stay at home. Amid bursts of tears, Ms Nantaba, who repeatedly choked on words and gasped for air, said:  I was shocked when a highly-placed person in security, who was trying to hatch a plan to have me assassinated, was promoted. The minister, a member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church, did not provide any names or other forms of an identifier, prompting government and police to question why she had not lodged a formal compliant with law enforcement officials. It does not help her by talking in tongues. She has access to the President, Inspector General of Police and Army Commander, she cannot tell us that the entire army wants to kill her,  Mr Ofwono Opondo, the executive director at Uganda Media Centre, said.Mr Fred Enanga, the police spokesperson, said they have no record of the minister s complaint about threats to her life. It is unfortunate that she is talking about threats in her life in the media. Let her come out and make these threats in writing,  he said.There have been previous incidents of politicians and security officials, among them former Arua Municipality MP Ibrahim Abiriga and former Buyende District police commander Muhammad Kirumira, who were shot dead last year after each publicly complained that men on motorcycles were trailing them. As it turned out, their killers fled on motorcycles. Other high-ranking individuals killed in similar fashion included senior state prosecutor Joan Kagezi, former police spokesperson Andrew Kawees, Maj (Rtd) Muhammed Kiggundu and about a dozen Muslim clerics. The then Inspector General of Police, Gen Kale Kayihura, whom President Museveni fired early last year after publicly scolding him that the Force he superintended had been infiltrated by  criminal elements,  blamed the high-profile killings on ADF elements.Gen Kayihura did not provide evidence, and Ms Nantaba punched holes in the assertions.  I have come here to tell you the truth because I have been in hiding and my enemies have been using the media to distort the information about how Ssebulime wanted to kill me,  Ms Nantaba said, adding:  I have decided to come here for prayers because I know when they kill [me], I will go to heaven.  Ms Nantaba s unrestrained swipe at the government prompted her Tourism counterpart, Mr Godfrey Kiwanda, to leap onto the podium and talk her out of further verbal assault. At the function, Ms Nantaba gave contradicting accounts from her earlier testimony of the events that followed the late Ssebulime s killing. She said Ssebulime, who was riding a motorbike, confronted her twice while peeping in her vehicle. The minister previously said Ssebulime stopped in front of her vehicle and rode away at a high speed, prompting her to pursue him.Ms Nantaba, in accounts we could not independently verify, said a top official of Uganda Communications Commission informed her that they had identified the caller believed to have issued last-minute orders to kill Ssebulime, who was already hand-cuffed, but the regulator, claimed that the information was  too sensitive. ResponseMr Ofwono Opondo, executive director at Uganda Media Centre:  It doesn t help her by talking in tongues. She has access to the President, Inspector General of Police and Army Commander, she (Nantaba) cannot tell us that the entire army wants to kill her.  Fred Enanga, police spokesperson:  Ms Nantaba can engage the UPDF leadership to be part of the security detail to investigate her claim Ssebulime s killing [is] being investigated by a special team from Kampala Metropolitan CID office.

4,"1,800 soldiers get post-war counselling - Daily Monitor","Kampala. At least 1,798 Uganda People s Defence Forces soldiers have been undergoing counselling and guidance after one year presence in Somalia fighting al-Shabaab insurgents. A statement issued by the army at the weekend quoted the Chief of Staff Land Forces, Maj Gen Leopold Kyanda, saying the programme was intended to help the soldiers recover from the post-war trauma, which is partly blamed for the increased fatal shootings within and outside the barracks.  The programme was very relevant in ensuring the forces recover from possible post-traumatic stress disorders after being involved in heavy combat and stressful environment for 12 months without the opportunity for annual leave as opposed to those serving within Uganda who are entitled to one to two months of annual leave,  the statement reads in part.Col Justus Rukundo, the Land Forces Director of Political Education, said it is now a routine for all the soldiers to undergo the exercise when they return from Somalia.Psychologists from Makerere University School of Psychology are hired to counsel the soldiers.Lt Col Henry Obbo, the Land Forces spokesperson, said in the same statement that the soldiers get the two-week counselling before they start their one-month leave to join their families.  They are also trained in political education, skills to improve their household incomes, land tenure system, attitude change and preparations for retirement,  he said.Last week, a soldier serving in Somalia shot dead his supervisor following a disagreement with his boss and later turned the gun on self and ended his life. In February, Pte Isaac Newton Okello was sentenced to 80 years for killing four of his family members. Other countries with troops in Somalia are Kenya, Ethiopia, Burundi and Djibouti.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/1-800-soldiers-get-post-war-counselling/688334-5122648-nm7bns/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post4.png
5,AAR clinics close over doctors  strike - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. At least eight out of the 11 private clinics operating under the Africa Air Rescue (AAR) Healthcare Uganda, have been closed since last Friday after doctors went on strike, protesting low salaries compared to their counterparts in other private and public hospitals.Some of the doctors Daily Monitor spoke to, said they decided to lay down their tools after management failed to live up to its promises from previous meetings held last year. The Uganda Medical Association (UMA) where we took our grievances after failure to reach an agreement on April 14, gave management four days to respond or else they give us a way forward to take industrial strike,  one of the striking doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being victimised, said yesterday. AAR headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, reportedly did not respond until 20 minutes to the Friday 17, 5pm deadline. Their response through a law firm, one doctor who read the document noted, contained threats that the internal human resources department would take unspecified action on doctors who abandon or fail to return on duty. We started the strike on Friday midnight and by yesterday, we had managed to close eight clinics. There are also those which are still open, but with no doctors,  one of the striking doctors said.Specifically, the doctors who receive between Shs1.8m and Shs2.1m net salary want their salaries adjusted to at least Shs3m. Those working part-time are demanding that their current pay of Shs12,000 per hour be revised to Shs13,000.The doctors also complained that the Shs15,000 given to specialists (such as paediatrics and gynaecologists) per patient is too little compared to the Shs50,000-Shs80,000 paid by patients. AAR Healthcare Uganda Limited is a subsidiary of AAR Healthcare Holdings Limited operating in the East African region. Mr Indren Pooven, the chief executive director of AAR Holdings Limited, said the board has approved the doctors  pay raise, and the adjustments will be effected next week. He, however, did not disclose the specifics.  The team has distributed my memo this afternoon and we will work out and communicate the specifics to the respective people this coming week,  Mr Pooven said by telephone from Nairobi yesterday.Dr Mukuuzi Muhereza, the UMA general secretary, criticised the AAR management s threats to take legal action against the doctors demanding fair pay. He asked the parties to instead settle the issues through negotiations and in the interest of patients. There has been a problem of poor communication by AAR management and, for us, what we want is for them to settle the issues amicably,  Dr Muhereza said.Following the announced consent by the employers, some of the striking doctors said they won t return to work until Mr Pooven s promise is put to them in writing.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/AAR-clinics-close-over-doctors--strike/688334-5122710-o2d9t1/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post5.png
6,Google and Android system start to cut ties with Huawei - Daily Monitor,"US internet giant Google, whose Android mobile operating system powers most of the world's smartphones, said Sunday it was beginning to cut ties with China's Huawei, which Washington considers a national security threat.In the midst of a trade war with Beijing, President Donald Trump has barred US companies from engaging in telecommunications trade with foreign companies said to threaten American national security.The measure targets Huawei, a Chinese telecoms giant in Washington's sights that is listed by the Commerce Department among firms with which American companies can only engage in trade after obtaining the green light from the authorities.The ban includes technology sharing.""We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,"" a Google spokesperson told AFP.The move could have dramatic implications since Google, like all tech companies, must collaborate with smartphone makers to ensure its systems are compatible with their devices.Google will have to halt business activities with Huawei that involve transfer of hardware, software and technical services that are not publicly available -- meaning Huawei will only be able to use the open source version of Android, a source close to the matter told AFP.Huawei will no longer have access to Google's proprietary apps and services, such as the Gmail email service.Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Huawei is a rapidly expanding leader in 5G technology but remains dependent on foreign suppliers.It buys about $67 billion worth of components each year, including about $11 billion from US suppliers, according to The Nikkei business daily.Huawei is the target of an intense campaign by Washington, which has been trying to persuade allies not to allow China a role in building next-generation 5G mobile networks. US government agencies are already banned from buying equipment from Huawei.Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei said Saturday that ""We have not done anything which violates the law,"" adding the US measures would have a limited impact.

7,Government orders KCCA to advertise jobs - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The Public Service Commission (PSC) has ordered the acting executive director of Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), Mr Andrew Kitaka, to advertise all vacant positions in the institution to ensure formalisation and work efficiency.The PSC chairperson, Justice Ralph Ochan, made the directive in an April 18 letter. All vacant posts, including but not limited to those where officers were administratively assigned duties to act be declared and displayed on KCCA notice boards, website and any other platform accessible to all KCCA staff,  the letter reads in part. All staff be informed and guided to apply for a maximum of two posts of their own choice clearly indicating the first and second choices on the application form and KCCA management will then compile, coordinate, guide the exercise appropriately and thereafter submit the application forms to the relevant authority for processing,  the letter adds. Justice Ochan also asked Mr Kitaka to halt assignments on acting capacity or administrative appointments on short term contracts until the affected positions are substantively filled.KCCA s payroll structure, a copy which this newspaper has seen, indicates that the institution currently employs 1,133 workers.Of these, 391 are employed on permanent terms. The staff on temporary terms serve a four-month renewable contract but their recruitment remains a point of contention to date.Mr Kitaka could not be reached for a comment regarding the directive. However, the acting supervisor public and corporate affairs in the office of the executive director, Mr Robert Kalumba, told Daily Monitor that their directorate of human resource would handle the matter. I have not seen the letter, but I am sure our human resource department is in liaison with Public Service Commission on that issue,  he stated.Last month, this newspaper reported that some KCCA officials had petitioned Kampala minister Beti Kamya, accusing management of elbowing them by appointing their  juniors  to work in senior positions in acting capacity.Last year, the authority working on the directive of PSC, called all successful candidates who were not deployed in 2013 to meet management for fresh deployment.Our source within KCCA s top management intimated that while some of the candidates had successfully challenged KCCA in court for locking them out, at least 130 candidates of candidates who didn t go to court have expressed interest to start work.The candidates, our source revealed, will commence work on July 1.Report findingsAccording to the institution s Public Accounts Committee (Pac) report released in December last year, a total of 280 candidates passed interviews to fill certain positions at KCCA in 2013. However, the report states only 45 candidates were offered positions while the rest are still pending despite being offered appointment letters by PSC. The positions for which they had applied for were filled by other individuals whose recruitment didn t follow the formal recruitment procedures and have held the same positions for a period exceeding one year as they are given temporary four months renewable contracts,  reads in part the report.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-orders-KCCA-advertise-jobs/688334-5122532-b4b8rfz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post7.png

""We estimate there are up to 50 million Nigerians with no access to bank accounts.""The flotation comes after years of difficulty in Nigeria, with MTN battling mammoth fines by the country's regulators.In December 2018, MTN agreed to pay $53 million to resolve a row with Nigeria's telecoms regulator (NCC), after being accused of illegally repatriating $8.13 billion to South Africa.The decision to impose fines shocked MTN and its foreign investors, with four commercial banks involved in the transfer also fined.The sanction was the latest in a series of fines to hit MTN since it began operations in Nigeria 17 years ago.In 2015 it was fined $5.2 billion in 2015 for failing to disconnect unregistered SIM cards on its network.The fine was later reduced to $1.7 billion after negotiations with the Nigerian government.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Telecom-giant-MTN-lists-shares-Nigeria-s-stock-exchange/688340-5120556-dag39uz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post9.png
10,UPDF takes over security at Kawolo hospital - Daily Monitor,"Buikwe. Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) have been deployed at Kawolo hospital in Buikwe District to crack down on the theft of building materials following a public request.The health facility is currently undergoing renovation and expansion.Residents and the hospital administration through the Resident District Commissioner, Ms Jane Frances Kagayi, called for the army s intervention after efforts by a private security company and police proved futile.Thugs have been stealing cement, iron bars, doors, solar panels and taps, among other materials.Daily Monitor learnt that private guards and police officers were withdrawn on May 9 while at least 20 UPDF soldiers from UPDF Engineering Brigade, Lugazi took over. Dr Joshua Kiberu, the hospital medical superintendent, said the deployment will improve security. The situation has been terrible, some of us could not catch sleep ever since the renovation works started. Now that the soldiers are here, we know they are going to solve this problem (theft),  Dr Kiberu said in an interview last week. Those people (thieves) have been stealing anything they could come across, and we were getting worried that one time, they might steal our patients,   he added. Dr Kiberu also said they are now challenged with replacing stolen items from the new buildings that have already been handed over. The contractor has been handing over whatever building he completes so that we can start using them for our daily operations. It is from these buildings where expensive items such as solar panels and doors, among others things, have been stolen,  he said.Dr Kiberu said the administration is yet to compute the amount of money lost in the theft.The renovation works are being undertaken by Excel Construction Company Ltd at a tune of Shs39b.Brig Richard Karemire, the UPDF spokesperson, said he was not aware of the deployment and referred us to UPDF officers at Gaddafi Barracks in Jinja District.Ms Kagayi, who chairs the district security committee, said deployment was a last resort. It was a hard decision to take, but we had nothing to do. Let our people cooperate with them (soldiers) by giving them information about that racket of stealing building materials,  she said.ReliefMr Steven Kikawula Mugoya, a councillor representing Kiwawula Ward at Lugazi Municipality, welcomed the deployment.  They have taken so long to come, but it is good they have responded and we do not expect to hear any more stealing of property,   Mr Mugoya said.A soldier, who talked to this newspaper on condition of anonymity since he is not the authorised to speak to the press, urged patients and caregivers not worry about their presence, saying they are there to restore sanity. We act differently in situations like this. So, those who have been surviving on stealing from this government facility, they should not dare step here again,   the army officer said.About hospitalKawolo hospital had not received major renovation since 1968. The hospital administrator, Dr Joshua Kiberu, said more than 90 per cent of the renovation works have been done, adding that fixing some machines and erection of a perimeter wall are left. Among the new facilities constructed are a trauma centre, a modern mortuary, new out-patient block, four staff houses and two operating theatres. The hospital has also been boosted with harvest tanks. The project, which will officially be handed over to government later this year, is funded by the Spanish government.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UPDF-takes-over-security-Kawolo-hospital/688334-5122560-2qyyvk/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post14.png
11,Nema vows to arrest wetland encroachers - Daily Monitor,"Kayunga. Encroachers who recently reclaimed a section of Ssezibwa wetland in Kayunga and Mukono districts face arrest, National Environment Management (Nema) officials have said.More than 500 people were evicted from the area in December last year.However, Mr Nicholas Magara, the Nema coordinator of wetland matters in the central region, said the encroachers have failed to respect the commitment. Last year, we were lenient and didn t arrest them. However, this time we are going to arrest and prosecute them and no one is going to blame us,  Mr Magara said last week.Section 36 of the National Environment Act provides for the protection of wetlands and prohibits reclamation, erection of illegal structures and empowers authorities to demolish any structure that is fixed in, on, under or above any wetland. The Kayunga environment officer, Mr Patrick Musaazi, said they are working with the Resident District Commissioner, District Internal Security Officer and the environment police to take action against the encroachers. We don t want any political interference when time comes to arrest those people,  Mr Musaazi said.A source within the police in Kayunga said a letter had been written to the commandant of the environmental protection unit in February about the issue, but said he had not received a response.Plead for leniency Some encroachers said they were forced back to cultivate in the wetland due to lack of arable land. We are landless yet we have to pay school fees for our children. We ask the President to allow us to grow crops because we have nowhere to go,  Mr Moses Mukisa, a resident, said.Statistics show that the country has lost more than 30 per cent of its wetlands in the last 23 years.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Nema-vows-arrest-wetland-encroachers/688334-5122568-30j940z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post15.png

13,Take risk to succeed in business - Kyambadde - Daily Monitor,"Amuru. The Minister of Trade, Industries and Cooperatives, Ms Amelia Kyambadde, has advised women in Acholi Sub-region to take risk if they are to succeed in their business ventures. Speaking on Thursday during the inauguration of Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd in Atiak Sub-county, Amuru District, Ms Kyambadde said many women in the region shy away from venturing into business opportunities that would turn profitable and change their lives because they fear losing money. Be ready to take risks, if you don t take risks, you will not be anywhere, take that risk to start a business and succeed,  she said adding that most of the successful people around the world took risks.Ms Kyambadde cited Amina Moghe Hersi, who is establishing Atiak Sugar Factory in Amuru saying she took a risk to start her investment.She lauded the outgrowers for venturing into sugarcane growing since the sugar industry is one of the key industries in East Africa citing that in Uganda, sugar production has increased by 10 per cent from 240,000 metric tonnes in 2008 to now 430,000 metric tonnes currently.Ms Kyambadde promised to help women outgrowers dealing in the production of honey, Shea butter oil, ground nut butter and crafts with fast tracking certification of their products.Ms Joyce Santa Laker, the chairperson Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd, said four districts are now directly implementing sugarcane growing citing Adjumani, Lamwo, Gulu and Amuru.She noted that their ultimate goal is to change the mind-set of the community and engage them in productivity.Ms Amina Moghe Hersi, the owner of Atiak Sugar Factory, told women that the region will now be the food basket of Africa since they will produce all food crops.Cooperative membershipThe Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd comprises 4,070 members, majority of whom are women from Acholi Sub-region and Adjumani District, who were former abductees, sex workers, persons with disability, HIV/Aids persons and those from nodding syndrome families.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Take-risk-succeed-business-Kyambadde/688334-5122600-kigj8e/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post17.png
14,"Bishop Zoreka decries child neglect, abuse - Daily Monitor","KANUNGU. The Bishop of Kinkiizi Diocese, Rt Rev Dan Zoreka, has said the future of the country will depend on the shaping of the young generation, and asked parents and community members to end child neglect and abuse.Officiating at the opening of a four-day women s conference in Kihihi Archdeaconry organised by Rev Ven Justus Tibesigwa on Friday, Bishop Zoreka said children have been neglected and parents do not talk to them to show them the right way. He added that the conditions children are living in are not favourable for their prosperity. Our children today are abused, they are given work that doesn t suit them, many have been neglected, abused and are subjected to torture. Praise God if you see yourself still doing well for your children.  These children will be here when we are not. As a nation, we must rise and work together to nurture the children so that when time comes, we get gifts from them,  Bishop Zoreka said.He said parents need to create time for their children and instil in them good values instead of trusting schools. He added:  These days, there are many things that pull us away; many parents are busy, they are looking for money in all ways. A parent can be busy and the whole week passes without talking to their children. The conference attracted more than 1,500 women from various parishes. Topics covered include attitude change, confidence-building, economic empowerment and personal development.  You can t nurture a child without money, you must be empowered economically; you can t parent when you don t have food thus you must be a hardworking mother who has food; you can t nurture a child when you are not a good example you must be a good example as a mother and a parent so that when a child is being nurtured, he sees you as a symbol of love,  Bishop Zoreka said.Businessman James Musinguzi Garuga asked women to develop self-confidence and should not take husbands as providers but partners in development if they want their families to succeed.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Bishop-Zoreka-decries-child-neglect-abuse/688334-5122680-rgn9cfz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post18.png
15,Theatres close over lack of staff - Daily Monitor,"KAKUMIRO. Kakumiro District health centres have abandoned key medical and surgical operations as their only theatres remain closed over lack of technical staff.Kakumiro District only has two well equipped theatres at Kakumiro and Kakindo health centre IVs in Kakumiro and Kakindo town councils, respectively. They all serve about 350,000 people. The crisis of key theatre staff such as anesthetists and theatre assistants has left the theatres closed for about a year.Key surgeries such as hernia, caesarean operation on expectant mothers and critical life threatening injuries cannot be handled there and patients are referred to either Mubende or Hoima regional referral hospitals, which are about an hour s drive away. The in-charge of Kakindo Health Centre, Dr Hargreaves Byaruhanga, said the theatre has been closed because of lack of key staff and this has left people to suffer with referrals. We have been raising our concerns ever since Infectious Diseases institute (IDI) stopped the  Saving Mothers, Giving Life  project, that was supporting us with staff. Later, everything came to a standstill,   Dr Byaruhanga said. He added:  Some expectant mothers have died or lost their babies because we refer them to Hoima or Mubende and these are distant places. We understand the pain our people are enduring and yet all their concerns would be attended to at our theatre here  .Ms Jane Kamagara, a resident of Kalangala Village, Kibijo Sub-county, Kagadi District, said her daughter lost a baby after she was referred to Mubende hospital and she reached late and doctors could not save her unborn baby.Ms Vastina Kabarungi, a resident of Irora Village in Kiryanga Sub-county, in the neighbouring Kagadi District, said she had battled hernia infection for years but she could not get operated on at Kakindo Health Centre IV because of the challenges at the theatre.Her life was saved last week when Adalante Africa, a non-government organisation held a free surgical camp with doctors from Spain. Dr Israel Kyejimbo, the in-charge at Kakumiro Health centre IV in Kakumiro Town Council, said the crisis has also affected operations at the health facility.  It is true that our theatre has not been working for about one year and the problem started when IDI withdrew the personnel support. We nowadays refer all cases necessitating surgery to Mubende hospital. We have received several cases of expectant mothers suffering ruptured uterus and others losing their babies because of delayed attention and poor transport system,   Dr Kyejimbo said.The Kakumiro District health officer, Dr Robert Senteza, said:   We have a known challenge for human resource in health in the district due to inadequate wage bill especially of critical staff gaps in that area of service of the theatre. With all stakeholders at all levels aware of this service delivery hiccup, joint collective efforts are on and the population should remain calm and hopeful as we try our best for the best,   Dr Senteza said.The Kakumiro District Chief Administrative Officer, Mr Stephen Monday, said the need for key staff at the health centers has been included in the next financial year recruitment plan.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Theatres-close-over-lack-staff/688334-5122686-158drrhz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post19.png
16,Uganda Pentecostal pastors urged to go for theological training - Daily Monitor,"Uganda Pentecostal pastors have been urged to embrace the doctrine of unity as preached by Jesus Christ and stop building empires on individual bases. According to Pastors Discipleship Network executive director, Dr Richmond Wandera, there is individuality of building institutions and empires for individual pastors who have forgotten the doctrine of unity.Dr Wandera made the remarks on Saturday at the end of a cross-country marathon in which about 200 pastors participated in the 13km race from Luzira to Bweyogerere and 450km race that took nine days from Nimule in South Sudan to Luzira in Kampala.He said there are many mistakes that pastors have made due to ignorance and therefore, need trainings to create awareness for the struggling pastors.""There are many mistakes made by pastors and yet the job of a pastor is to preach accurately, teach and disciple well and also lead people,"" he said.He said a mistake has been done in the teaching and manipulating messages that are far from the gospel. They ask for money in a way the Bible doesn't allow and they have been inspired by false pastors. What we are doing is helping and launching pastors into the Ministry who have no grounding and trainings,  he added.He emphasized natural gifting is no substitution for training therefore, all pastors need theological training.""When you look at the disciples, they were fisher men but they spent three years with Jesus learning and observing, that's why they became experts,"" he said.He said the African study Bible will be distributed across the country to struggling pastors.He said the marathon was also to create awareness as they organise trainings for pastors in rural areas as well.""The trainings include theological teachings, preaching, leadership, discipleship and entrepreneurship, among thers,  he added.Manley Klassen, a guest from US California said the marathon was a good initiative done to support struggling pastors and those without training.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Uganda-Pentecostal-pastors-urged-go-theological-training/688334-5122434-jjs608/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post20.png
17,Parents narrate hustle of caring  for children with hydrocephalus - Daily Monitor,"About two years ago, Ms Teddy Najjuuko, a resident of Namere Village in Wakiso District, gave birth to her first born, Jonathan Mayende, who was normal. Months later, doctors diagnosed him with hydrocephalus, a condition that makes the head grow oversize due to low absorption rates of water in the body. He used to sleep for many hours and I would have to force him to breastfeed. The normal head eventually started growing bigger,  Ms Najjuuko says. Doctors at Cure Hospital dragonised him with the condition but I had never heard of it. I did not know its signs and symptoms,  Ms Najjuuko adds.She says her husband abandoned them upon realising that the child had been diagnosed with the condition.  I could not stay with my husband s parents because they thought it was my fault. I went back to my parents  home where I live up to now. As if it is not traumatising enough, even most members of society have rejected my child. They call him names,  she says.Doctors say about 60 per cent of hydrocephalus cases in Africa are due to infections [germs], others are caused as a result of head injuries and tumors, among others, yet sometimes hydrocephalus develops while the child is still in the uterus (mother s womb). The cause is unknownDr Agatha Namutosi Wakama, a medical worker at Cure Children s Hospital, says the fluids accumulate in the ventricles (chambers), compressing the brain thus damaging it.A research conducted by Cure Hospital and conservative prevalence rates from National Institute of Health indicate that between 3,600 and 5,400 children in Uganda are born with or develop the condition every year.Dr Wakama says:  Victims of hydrocephalus have increasing head size, poor feeding habits with failure to gain weight, suffer constant vomiting, severe headache in children and adults and irritability. When Sunday Monitor met the sick child, we could observe that the child was heavy in weight and could not talk, save for the communications using his eyes. I can know when he wants food and when he is in pain. For instance, when you ask him whether he is hungry, he will close his eyes in affirmative and opens them to negate,  she says.Ms Najjuuko is not the only mother struggling to raise a child with hydrocephalus. Ms Harriet Namusoke, a mother with a child suffering from the same condition, says she had to quit her job to take care of her child. Other parents think that if their children play with ours or even when they touch them, they will contract the condition, which is not the case. There is a lot of stigma that comes from the community. Some think it is some sort of a curse. They have no idea that we are dealing with  expensive  children,  Ms Namusoke said.InterventionMs Ruth Nalujja, the executive director of Spinabifida and Hydrocephalus Awareness Network - Uganda, an association of parents with children with hydrocephalus and spinabifida, says parents and society should understand that the disease is not a curse and it can be treated. They too have a right to privacy and should be respected,  Ms Nalujja says.She advises that taking folic acid before giving birth prevents the risk by 70 per cent.Dr Wakama says expectant women should give birth in the hospital not at home or small village clinics, and that they should avoid use of old razor blades to cut umbilical cord as it is a source of infections [germs]. Do not put anything such as cow dung and lizard dung on the umbilical stump in an attempt to accelerate healing. Keep the baby in clean condition and wash your hands with soap before feeding/holding a new born baby [neonate] in an attempt to prevent infections. In case of a fever and or convulsions, seek immediate help from the hospital. Timely referral of the sick newborn,  she said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Parents-narrate-hustle-caring-children-oversize-heads/688334-5121102-6jq4tfz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post21.png
18,Why masculine sexual privilege persists in Uganda - Daily Monitor,"At 20, Christine officially married a man with a good job as a medical assistant. Over the next decade, they had five children together. But then her husband fell sick and died of HIV/Aids. From that point forward, she knew she too was infected, and because she was monogamous while her husband had two other long-term relationships during their marriage, she felt he was to blame. But Christine was not embittered. She told Robert Wyrod   At that time, people were not fearing HIV/Aids so much. They were not well informed.  In the course of the next decade, both her co-wives also died of HIV/Aids. But Christine never remarried after her husband s death. As I listened to Christine s story, I came to appreciate the devastating toll HIV/Aids had taken on her family. In addition to her husband and co-wives, she had lost a brother to the disease. She then started sharing her house with her younger sister, Mary, who was in the advanced stages of HIV/Aids too,  Wyrod writes in his new ethnography titled Aids and Masculinity in the African City. Like Christine, Mary believed her husband had infected her with HIV/Aids. Over the next six months, I watched as Mary slowly succumbed to the disease, even after gaining access to antiretroviral drugs. Christine was devastated by her death. The disturbing images of Mary s frail body on their couch remain with me still, tempered only by memories of her courage and dry wit in the face of her suffering,  Wyrod adds.Combating AidsThe first book to examine how the Aids epidemic has changed masculinity in Africa is based on Wyrod s decade (2004-2015) of ethnographic research, fieldwork and interviews in the densely populated Bwaise slum community in the capital, Kampala. This book reveals the persistence of masculine privilege in the age of Aids and the implications such privilege has for combating Aids across the African continent.Aids has been a devastating plague in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, yet the long-term implications for gender and sexuality are just emerging. This book tackles this issue head-on and examines how Aids has altered the ways masculinity is lived in Uganda. Christine, a 44-year-old widow has lived in Bwaise for more than two decades. Christine is treasurer of a Post-Test Club, and she has passionately channeled her own experience living with HIV into educating and counselling residents of Bwaise about Aids. Christine survives by making and selling maandazi (sweet fried bread)   an effort that yields about $1 (Shs3,700) in profit per day. Wyrod says this glimpse into Christine s life encapsulates what motivated him to write about how Aids has shaped gender and sexuality in Uganda.  Christine s story reveals the ubiquity of Aids in a place like Bwaise and shows how the disease has become a pervasive aspect of everyday life. From my visits with Christine, it was obvious that Aids had not only ravaged her family but her community as well,  Wyrod says.  Christine s story is also emblematic of the many Ugandans who take action to address the disease, whether by being part of an Aids support group, or helping those afflicted with the disease, or simply by discussing Aids in a frank and open manner,  he adds.According to Wyrod, most centrally for this book, Christine s life also illustrates the role that gender relations have played in the epidemic. Both she and Mary claimed to be monogamous wives and believed they were infected with HIV by their husbands. The book reveals some challenges to, but the ultimate persistence of, men s sexual privileges in the age of Aids   a finding that provides an important corrective to the conventional portrayal of Uganda as Africa s great Aids success story. Men s multiple sexual partnerships have roots in pre-colonial Uganda and remains in practice today across the country. For example, the Baganda have a saying  Omusajja okusajjalaata  or  Omusajja alina okusajjalaata  (meaning that a man has to show his manhood, and should have those multiple partners). According to Wyrod, to some men to prove they are men is having many women as sexual partners.  However, they admit that Aids has complicated such already complex relationship dynamics, and they stress it was something they worried about a great deal,  he says. Attentive. Mr Robert Wyrod (right) and other participants during the discussion of the book. COURTESY PHOTOAccording to a Uganda Aids Commission (UAC) March 2014 report titled  District HIV/Aids Support Supervision and Follow up of HIV/Aids Activities Implemented in Local Governments,  the reported epidemic drivers included alcoholism, multiple sexual partnerships, commercial sex work and low condom use, among others. According to the 2011 Uganda Aids Indicator Survey, three per cent of Ugandan women age 15-49 reported having two or more sexual partners in the past 12 months. Multiple sexual partnerships ranges from a low of one per cent of women in the South Western and West Nile regions to a high of five per cent in East Central region and Kampala.The proportion of men aged 15-49, who had two or more sexual partners in the past 12 months, is more than six times higher than the proportion of women (19 per cent versus three per cent). Among men, multiple sexual partnerships are most common in the East Central (31 per cent) and Mid-Western (25 per cent) regions.  While many conventional approaches to HIV prevention in Uganda continue to focus on promoting monogamy and  being faithful , in my view the number of sexual partners a man or women has is not the key issue. I make the case, instead, that a serious engagement with the persistence of men s privileges to dictate the terms of sex and the freedom to choose, on their own, to establish multiple sexual partnerships is crucial to efforts to address Aids in Uganda, as well as the many other African countries affected by HIV,  Wyrod observes.In the urban Ugandan context, Wyrod uses the term masculine sexual privilege to refer to both men s authority to dictate the terms of sex and a man s right to multiple sexual partners if he so chooses, whether they are wives, girlfriends, or shorter-term partners. Economic insecurity and gender-based violence combine to impede women s ability to negotiate safe sex.According to Wyrod, relationship pressures over money and family intensify to the point that the man, and occasionally the woman, began exploring other relationships.  There was much starting, stopping, and overlap in relationships in Bwaise, all exacerbated by poverty and the persistence of masculine sexual privilege,  he says. Gender tensionsMen s identity as family providers was such a poignant topic for Wyrod s informants. What this book reveals is that gender tensions were also deeply intertwined with sexuality, including the ways some men sought to shore up an embattled masculinity through their intimate relationships. Wyrod notes that women s increasing access to education allows some women to not only provide supplementary income, but actually compete with men as primary providers, which raises questions of authority in the household. Novel ideas of women s rights and gender equity have also gained legitimacy and frame contemporary tensions and negotiations in new ways. The majority of men Wyrod interacted with in his fieldwork were receptive to expanded women s rights, so long as these did not undermine their authority within the home. For such men, women s rights should be limited in scope and not synonymous with equality between men and women.Women marrying men, building house, owning businesses and land today are changing gender relations in Uganda. Women have acquired associated resources and are challenging their husband s authority. Wyrod notes that men are acknowledging the shifting gender relations and are still grappling with how these changes are affecting the meaning of manhood in Uganda. Most men are against testing for HIV with their wives which leaves the latter with few options to negotiate greater sexual safety in their relationships with their husbands. According to Wyrod, women expressed frustration about having limited ability to influence their husband s sexual behaviour. They also expressed a great deal of frustration about how their male partners dealt with the disease, especially the denial of HIV infection. Although some women have chosen monogamy as their primary protection strategy, they are well aware of the limitations of this approach. For example, if there are two wives in a polygamous marriage, one wife will never know what her co-wife is doing to protect herself from HIV infection through extra relationships, or the husband sticking to his two wives. Wyrod observes that although some women are concerned about men s sexuality, they are nonetheless willing to accommodate their husband s desires to have more than one sexual partner, so long as they remained attentive to them and their children. A common trend that Wyrod observed among HIV positive men in Bwaise was their struggle with disclosing their HIV status to their wives for fear that the wives could leave them and they would die alone.Book cover. Mr Robert Wyrod s book.Multiple partnersWyrod observes that the right to have multiple sexual partners was a reservoir of privilege that men could draw on when their relationships became stressed, often due to financial problems.  This was especially common when a couple s children entered school and the financial responsibilities for men increased. It is important to underscore that these types of concurrent, overlapping, long-term relationships are now recognised as especially effective ways of transmitting HIV,  he says. In 15 months of fieldwork in Bwaise, Wyrod rarely encountered women with sexual lives as complicated as those of many men.   Yet my fieldwork also made evident the social and health risks women with multiple partners faced, making me believe women s claims to monogamy were not dramatically exaggerated. The handful of women who told me they were sleeping with more than one man nearly always asserted they did it out of economic necessity. Both women and men frequently told me that money was the main reason women sought out additional sexual partners,  he notes.  The Aids epidemic has made men s control over the terms of sex and men s privilege of having multiple sexual partners more convoluted and contentious. Yet while Aids has complicated aspects of masculine sexual privilege, it has not truly challenged it ,  Wyrod observes, adding:  Given Uganda s success in fighting Aids   a success believed to be predicated in part on men reducing their sexual partnerships   the persistence of male masculine sexual privilege is unexpected at first glance   About the bookAids and Masculinity in the African City was released by University of California Press in July 2016. The 312-page book that is divided into six chapters was launched in Kampala in July 2017.The book is going for $30 on Amazon.

19,Makerere University staff accuse council of betrayal - Daily Monitor,"Makerere University academic, administrative and support staff in an emotive meeting on Friday accused the university s Appointments Board of using information provided by a former chairperson of the Makerere University Council to  victimise  his subordinate.Prof Anthony Mugagga, the deputy principal of College of Education, said Mr Charles Wana-Etyem, the former Makerere University Council chairperson, testified against Dr Deus Muhwezi, the chairperson of Makerere University Academic Staff Association (Muasa), before the Appointments Board using information he had entrusted him with as a leader. It is on the basis of this information, Prof Mugagga said, that the Appointments Board based to suspend Dr Kamunyu from the university service for six months. He said this set a bad precedent that has left those in leadership exposed. I am privy to a lot of information from staff and students. Kindly assure them that what former Council chair did with information he was given as chair will never happen again,  Prof Mugagga shouted out to Mr Daniel Kidega, a member of Council, who attended the associations  meeting to review the decision of the Appointments Board.Dr Robert Kakuru from the College of Humanities said the decision left the staff divided. You found us with a small puncture in Dr Deus Muhwezi as an association leader. You requested to take it and repair the puncture. You brought it back without two wheels. How do you expect the associations to react   he asked.Mr Kidega asked the staff to be patient and explore all the avenues available, saying that the University Council would not accept decisions that are against the Constitution.Some of the staff members in the meeting wanted a resolution made to declare a strike until Dr Kamunyu is reinstated. At the start of this semester, the staff went on strike when the Vice Chancellor, Prof Barnabas Nawangwe, suspended Dr Kamunyu and other leaders of staff associations in a way that the staff said was improper. The strike was suspended after it was agreed that the Appointments Board would investigate the matter. The members of staff are now aggrieved with its decision despite it clearing other leaders and Dr Kamunyu on some charges except on the charge of alleging corruption on the part of some top leaders of the university.It emerged during the meeting on Friday that the testimony on which the board based to convict Dr Kamunyu was provided by Dr Etyem, who reportedly got the information from Dr Kamunyu when the former confided in him as chairman of Council. Mr Kidega moved to calm the flaring tempers. He said:  There is the Whistleblowers Act. It is very unfortunate that a senior citizen can testify against staff with information he had been given. I have a lot of respect for Engineer Etyem. You don t speak about your staff even when you are a senior citizen and have capacity to respond. It is being unethical. We adhere to the Constitution of Uganda and make sure this university is governed under it. The protection of the Whistleblowers Act is in place. We shall utilise it in this university. The staff later agreed to suspend their industrial action for an extra two months to allow the tribunal to hear Dr Muhwezi s appeal, which he said he will submit on Monday. The meeting, which was chaired by Dr Edward Mwavu, Dr Kamunyu s deputy, also appealed that all affected staff whose cases are before the tribunal that will be chaired by Justice Patrick Tabaaro be concluded expeditiously.The members agreed to contribute Shs50m towards Dr Muhwezi s legal fees and make a contribution to supplement his half pay the appointments committee subjected him to as he serves six months on suspension without accessing the university premises as a lecturer. The university accused Dr Kamunyu in January of taking part in an illegal strike, using abusive language, acts or omissions that are prejudicial to the proper performance of duties or the university s image, non-adherence to any other university policies and slander. A committee was instituted to investigate the accusations and has since convicted Muhwezi on one count out of the five. During the probe, the university presented four witnesses, including Prof William Bazeyo, the deputy vice chancellor in charge of Finance, the former university Council chairperson Dr Etyem, Dr Robert Wamala and Mr Gordon Mulangira, Prof Barnabas Nawangwe s personal assistant.However, the committee chaired by Masaka District Chairman Jude Mbabaali said prosecution had failed to prove that Dr Muhwezi had committed the offences except on non-adherence to any other university policies in which Dr Etyem accused him of giving him information without proof against the former Appointment s Board chairperson, Mr Bruce Balaaba, and the Finance committee chair, Mr Thomas Tayebwa.  It is clear from the un-rebutted prosecution evidence that the respondent neglected and failed to adhere to the university s general code of conduct. Additionally, that he neglected and wilfully refused to comply with guidance and directives issued to him as a member of staff,  reads the May 13 ruling.It adds:  Evidence adduced shows that respondent was warned by the vice chancellor in writing to desist from attacks on unsubstantiated allegations but he refused and neglected to comply with the directives. It is our opinion that all this conduct was in bad faith and unbecoming. This charge has been proved and therefore find the respondent guilty of this count as charged. The board in its wisdom has decided to use its discretion as provided in the university human resource manual; that instead of dismissal to sentence the respondent to six months suspension with immediate effect. Other committee members were: Mr Kiryowa Kiwanuka, Chris Ninsiima, Ms Jolly Uzamukunda Karabaaya and Mr Winston Tumps Ireeta.Dr Etyem testified that he met the respondent while he was still council chairperson alleging that Mr Kabaasa was receiving bribes to award jobs but when he asked him for evidence, he couldn t provide it and that Mr Tayebwa who was chairing the appointment s board finance and investment committee was over stepping his mandate. AccusationsDr Etyem s other accusation is that Dr Muhwezi complained about the Makerere University manual which had been changed without consulting the association. He testified that he warned Dr Muhwezi to stop making those allegations without proof which he disregarded.  After the meeting, he came to a conclusion that all those complaints raised by the respondent were mere allegations without proof because when he asked him for proof so that as chair of council he can handle the complaints, he didn t provide them,  the report adds.Dr Muhammad Kiggundu, the director of communications, said management was open to any negotiations to end the impasse.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Makerere-University-staff-accuse-council-betrayal/688334-5121090-15gfnb4/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post23.png
20,Government investment in private hospitals not helping poor - Daily Monitor,"Whereas the government has set out to use public-private partnerships (PPPs) to ensure universal health coverage, research has revealed that the deal never translated into increased access or equitable treatment for the poor.This is one of the findings of a research that was carried out by Initiative for Social and Economic Rights (ISER), an NGO, to establish whether health, finance and development policies are translating into the provision of services that guarantee the rights of Uganda s vulnerable populations.The report titled,  Achieving Equity in Health: Are Public-Private Partnerships the Solution  , concludes that investing in public healthcare where most of the poor go for treatment would make more sense than investing in an arguably risky private project.The report was released a month after Parliament approved a proposal to issue promissory notes to the tune of Shs1.3 trillion to Finasi/Roko Construction Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Ltd to finance the construction of the proposed International Specialised Hospital of Uganda at Lubowa, in Wakiso District. There is no evidence that strengthening the private sector results in better health outcomes for the poor and rural communities. If anything, evidence has shown that private for profit is unlikely to deliver better health outcomes for the poor people and exacerbates inequalities, resulting in the rich being able to access better healthcare and the poor excluded,  the report reads in part.The report also pokes holes in the arguments that private sector-led health facilities are more efficient than public health facilities. The research also indicts the regulatory framework for PPPs, describing them as  weak and piecemeal . Laws such as the PPP Act, 2015, PPP Policy Framework 2010 and the National Public Private Partnership in Health Policy 2012, the document says, create overlapping and contradictory obligations.According to the report, no specific methodology that would ensure economic analysis, fiscal affordability, risk identification and transfer, value for money, assessment for human rights compliance were followed during the formulation of the laws.Government s funding to the health sector over the last several years, the report says, has oscillated between 7 and 9 per cent of the National Budget, standing at 7.4 per cent this financial year and 6.4 per cent the previous year, all of which is way below the 15 per cent that African Union countries committed to in the Abuja Declaration.The report indicts government for failure to fulfill its promise to improve healthcare for the poor and geographically isolated. Instead, it relies on mostly foreign donor and religious PNFPs [Private Not For Profit organisations] to provide essential services. Sometimes, the government provides significant funding to PNFPs to service an area in lieu of establishing public facilities,  it says.RecommendationsISER calls on government to increase the budgetary allocation to the health sector and work with Parliament to improve the PPP laws. Government, the reports says, should cease looking at the private sector as its substitute. Public private partnerships cannot compensate for a weak State and require the State to maintain a strong and consistent stewardship role,  it says.The document also called on MPs to refrain from approving PPPs without following legally defined procedure, allocate more funds to the health sector and pass a national insurance scheme to allow for equitable access to health care. ISER also called on donors to invest in the public health sector.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-investment-private-hospitals-not-helping-poor/688334-5121032-jeo36r/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post24.png
21,Contractor risks being thrown out over slow works on Masaka market - Daily Monitor,"Masaka. Multiplex Ltd and Alshams Construction Company Ltd, the firms constructing Masaka Central Market, risk losing the contract over delayed works.Work on the market, which started in February last year, was expected to be completed by July 30 next year, but so far only 33 per cent of work is complete. Mr Geoffrey Ettedu, the Masaka project coordinator for Market and Agricultural Trade Improvement Project (MATIP-2) under the Ministry of Local Government, said the slow pace of construction may force them to cancel the contract if the contractor does not complete at least 65 per cent of the work in the next two months. When a government delegation visited the site in February, the contractor had promised to complete the first floor by March. However, a visit to the site on Thursday revealed this has not been the case.Mr Ettedu said contractors working on the same market projects in other municipalities such as Mbarara and Kitgum, have already completed at least 50 per cent of the work.  The most disappointing thing is that the Masaka market project was among the first projects to start, but we are behind schedule. So, we are strongly considering terminating the contract or taking legal action,  Mr Ettedu said during a visit to the site on Thursday. The market project is funded by the African Development Bank and Ugandan government at a tune of Shs18.4b. Mr Moses Ndege Bbosa, the managing director of Multiplex Ltd, said a number of challenges, including inadequate manpower and bad weather are holding them back.He, however, said in order to complete work in time, they have decided to work in shifts, with some employees working during day and others during the night.Masaka Municipality Mayor Godfrey Kayemba said they are ready to offer all the necessary support to the contractor to enable them complete the work in the stipulated time frame.Ms Elizabeth Nakayiza, the chairperson of the Masaka Central Market Vendors Association, urged the contractor to speed up work on the project, saying the place where vendors were temporarily relocated is in a poor condition and their merchandise always get soaked in dirty water whenever it rains.The old Masaka Central Market structure, which was constructed in 1936, was pulled down early last year to pave way for the new market. It used to house more than 1,000 vendors.The new market, once complete, is expected to accommodate more than 2,000 vendors. It will also have an agro-processing facility, stalls, shops, cold rooms, restaurants, a parking yard and loading and offloading areas, drainage ways, solid waste bays, firefighting facilities, among others.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Contractor-risks-being-thrown-out-slow-works-Masaka-market/688334-5121014-hsbau4z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post25.png
22,Residents petition minister over shoddy roadworks - Daily Monitor,"LYANTONDE.  Residents of three villages in Kyewanula Parish, Lyantonde Sub-county in Lyantonde District, have petitioned the State minister for Works, Gen Katumba Wamala, to prevail over a contractor who they accuse of doing shoddy work.In a petition dated May 7, signed by Mr Abdul Nyanzi, the Kamengo Village chairperson, they state that although roadworks on the 9.5km Kempega-Kiwootoozi-Buyanja road were completed early this month, gapping potholes have started to emerge.The project was awarded to Bresum Enterprises Ltd at a cost of Shs325m.The residents also claim the contractor used poor quality murrum and culverts and whenever it rains, water floods their houses.The road passes through the villages of Kiwootoozi, Mpumudde, Kamengo, Kempega, Kasese, Kabayanda, Kyewanula and Buyanja. Our houses get flooded whenever it rains because the culverts used do not allow easy water flow. In some sections of the road, water remain stagnant in the middle of the road,  Mr Nyanzi said in an interview with this newspaper on Thursday.No value for moneyMr Fred Muhangi, the Lyantonde District chairperson, told this newspaper that construction works were poorly done yet a lot of money was injected into the project. As a district, we had allocated Shs40 million to work on the same road and our work would even be better than what they did, but the Ministry of Works decided to source a contractor to do the work,  he said.But Mr James Kakooza, the Kabula County MP, while appearing on a local radio station last weekend, asked residents to accept what has been done by the contractor, saying  no one knows where the money for road was got from. When contacted on the matter, Ms Susan Kataike, the Ministry of Works and Transport spokesperson, said she could not authoritatively comment on the matter, asking for more time to consult her superiors.But Gen Wamala said when the ministry allocates funds for roadworks in districts, it is the local leadership to supervise and raise the red flag in case of shoddy work. Where were they [district] as the direct beneficiaries when the contractor was doing shoddy work  I will charge the local leaders on ground who failed to carry out supervision,  he said by telephone on Thursday.Ms Rhodah Tiitwe Kagaaga, the Lyantonde deputy Resident District Commissioner, said since the contract funds are wired to the district bank account, she was going to ask the chief administrative officer (CAO) to halt any payments to the contractor. The CAO should not process any payment to the contractor until the road works are accomplished,  Ms Kagaaga said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Residents-petition-minister-over-shoddy-roadworks/688334-5121070-iud9ij/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post26.png

24,Israel asks Uganda to open embassy in Jerusalem - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. The Israelis on Thursday appealed to government of Uganda to open an embassy in their country to ease trade and promote tourism.Speaking at a prayer breakfast in Kampala, the Israel Deputy Ambassador to Kenya Mr David Eyal asked Christians to pray for them as they battle with their  enemies . He said they have been supporting Uganda in areas of education, agriculture and security and hoped their meeting yesterday would boost future collaboration. It is not easy to be there in the Middle East surrounded by enemies. They want to destroy us. With all the enemies that want to destroy us, we are stronger with you and we appreciate it. Our hope is not lost. I invite you all to come to Jerusalem in the holy land to walk in the path of Jesus. We have a strong army,  Mr Eyal said.The First Lady, Ms Janet Museveni then invited the guests at the prayer breakfast at Hotel Africana to stand with her and prayed against violence and fear in Israel and restoration of peace.  We pray for your Holy Spirit to convict us all about sin, righteousness and the judgment to come so that we will work for truth and forgiveness in the Lord Jesus, and always strive to find peace through your son Jesus Christ. We ask that the destructive plans of the enemy be brought to nothing, and that your perfect plan may quickly come to pass. We pray for the Jewish and Arab believers in Jerusalem to come together and truly love one another,  Ms Museveni who doubles as education minister prayed. Mr Robert Llatore, co-chair Jerusalem prayer breakfast said their intercessions had started yielding fruits after United States of America President Donald Trump recognised that Jerusalem was Israel s city at their 70th independence anniversary.  I want to declare this morning that if Uganda will take a step and open an embassy in Jerusalem not one man will get to say we don t have a budget to open an embassy in Uganda. Pray for peace of Jerusalem the opening of embassy in Jerusalem is important to us in Israel and for Uganda if it dawns on us that the embassy is opened, may the blessings follow you, the opening of the embassy will lead to good cooperation in economic, security, technological and spiritual fields,  Mr Llatore said.In a separate interview yesterday, the State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Okello Oryem, said they consider Israel as a close ally and that they worked closely in agriculture and security and that there have been assurances to put the embassy in Israel. We have already given assurance to Israel when Prime Minister Netanyahu was here that government would open an embassy in Israel. It is among our priorities although I don t know when this will materialise,  Mr Oryem said on phone. Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Uganda in 2016. Mr Eyal said they have increased the number of students they have been sponsoring from Uganda to train in agriculture in Israel from 200 to 240 this year.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Israel-asks-Uganda-open-embassy-Jerusalem/688334-5119218-mk98nxz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post28.png
25,How prepared are we in case of fire outbreaks  - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. When President Museveni invited a German company to set up a fire brigade station in Uganda, his remark raised questions why government should be looking to a private company to provide fire-fighting services, which is the mandate of the Uganda Police Force.The President made the proposal while meeting Mr Hans-Georg Hinterberger, the country representative of the German company Achelis Uganda Limited, at State House in Kampala. He asked the company to  consider partnering with Uganda Police Force to make a fire wing in Uganda Police Force  to provide fire brigade training and equipment, which the police critically lack or are short of.In an interview with Daily Monitor, the director of the police Fire Prevention and Rescue Services, Mr Joseph Mugisa, said they have only 650 personnel and 98 fire-fighting trucks in 46 stations thinly spread across the country to serve the 40 million population and more than 300 urban centres that have a high fire risk. This compares miserably with the directorate s requirement of at least 1,000 personnel and about 200 trucks and stations. We think if we have 206 trucks and stations, these would be sufficient to respond to all emergencies across the country,  Mr Mugisa said. For fire-fighting we are 650, manning 46 fire stations countrywide. We have minimum numbers based on the equipment and classes of fire trucks available. We are still small but our plan is to grow and cover the whole country. There are so many gaps remaining to be covered. We would love to be in every major town of this country,  he added.Mr Mugisa supported the President s proposal to have a private investor provide fire emergency and rescue services to supplement the police. He said the private players would help to train Ugandan police within the country other than sending them abroad.He said the proposal would mitigate the shortage of capacity in fire fighting services in the police and save the government the high costs of setting up such facilities. He said the invitation to the German company is welcome because local private companies have not shown interest in providing such services. Where are they  Basically we don t have such private players here. I recently attended a meeting at the State House where this private German company expressed interest and they could be the only one. So we need them to come in and we work as a team,  Mr Mugisa said.He said the shortage of fire brigade capacity is enormous and requires urgent redress.Mr Mugisa said in Kampala Metropolitan area, the problem is compounded by heavy traffic, narrow roads and congested structures which slow the mobility of the police fire brigade trucks. He said in up-country areas, the long distances between different fire stations make the problem more complex.In many past fire accidents, it took police fire fighters several hours to arrive at the scene often after irreversible losses of property and life have occurred.For example, for the 2018 fire at St Bernard Secondary School, Manya in Rakai District that claimed lives of 11 students, it took the police fire brigade over two hours to arrive at the scene. The residents said a lot could have been saved if the police fire squad had intervened in time.In Jinja District, when fire gutted Kiira radio station, residents blamed police fire fighters for delaying to arrive. A similar case was reported at Makerere University Business School Nakawa in May last year when a hostel caught fire and it took long for police to respond to the emergency. Even when they arrived, they were ill-equipped for the task.While the number of urban centres and population has increased, there has not been corresponding growth in fire-fighting stations with the required equipment and personnel.Mr Mugisa said the police need at least 1,000 fire personnel to provide an effective and prompt response to a fire outbreak. He said police are supposed to respond to a fire accident within 3-15 minutes from the time of the outbreak.Most cars and trucks have a speed limit of between 50km/h to 80km/h, meaning that fire fighting engines are supposed to be within a range of about 20km apart to effectively respond to fire emergencies.Mr Mugisa said while the standard response time is between 3 and 15 minutes, many times police even take hours to reach the scene because they are thinly spread, constrained by long distances to the scene and heavy traffic along the way. If we talk about effectiveness, we need more personnel, more fire stations and equipment. Look at our highways; the stations are far apart yet for fire emergencies, we need maximum of 15 minutes response. Otherwise you will get there when everything is completely destroyed,  he said.According to Mr Mugisa, all municipalities, urban centres and highways are supposed to have a fire station each. Currently Uganda has 41 municipalities and about 180 town councils. All these need fire fighting equipment and growth of urbanisation. The moment you see increased activity in an area, then you expect an increase in the risk of fire or other emergencies occurring. Along our highways, we expect emergencies to occur and they do occur. For instance, we have a station at Luweero, but its coverage is too big yet it is a very busy highway. We need more of those facilities along all our highways if we are to be very effective in handling the fire emergencies,  he said.ConcentrationCurrently, almost half of the fire stations and trucks in the country are within Kampala Metropolitan area and the other half are in the old districts. For Kampala, we are spread out in quite a number of places. We have more than 200 personnel to manage the metropolitan area of Kampala,  Mr Mugisa said.Fire stations within Kampala metropolitan area include the headquarters at Clock Tower, Kololo, Wandegeya, Bweyogerere, Namanve, Mukono, Entebbe, Kajjanzi, Kabalagala, Kawempe, Nansana, Nateete, Kira and Wakiso.Mr Mugisa said police receive daily fire emergency requests from different parts of the city and surrounding areas. The emergencies include road accidents, fire outbreaks and drowning, among others. Our officers do not rest, we are always on the move. That s why to respond very fast, we have to spread out our facilities. We need to expand the facilities more to cover the metropolitan area,  he said. Outside Kampala metropolitan area, other districts that have fire stations include Arua, which serves West Nile sub-region, Gulu and Kitgum for Acholi, Lira for Lango and Moroto for Karamoja.Others are Mbarara, Kabale, Fort Portal, Masaka, Jinja, Iganga, Hoima, Masindi, Mbale, Luweero, Kisoro, Kirywandongo and Tororo.However, Mr Mugisa noted that on average, each of the above fire stations serves between three to five districts, which are far away from each other and the situation is getting worse with creation of new districts.Past fire incidentsBudo.  In 2008, the country woke up to the horror, that would leave parents, pupils, school management and Ugandans perplexed when Budo Junior caught fire, killing 19 pupils. By the time the fire fighters reached, irreversible damage had been done, loss of human lives and school buildings in ruins.In 2015, a report by the Directorate of Police Fire Prevention and Rescue Services indicated that the country was losing up to Shs30b annually to fire accidents and said the situation was likely to worsen with the country s rapid population growth and urbanisation.A total of 1,099 fire emergencies were handled in 2017 compared to 1,356 in 2016 giving a 19 per cent decrease.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/How-prepared-we-case-of-fire-outbreaks/688334-5119152-b2gh8t/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post29.png
26,Teachers insist on strike ahead of term - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Teachers under their umbrella association yesterday maintained their position to go on strike on Monday when schools officially open for the second term if government does not respond to their salary enhancement demands. Mr Filbert Baguma, Uganda National Teachers  Union (Unatu) general secretary told Daily Monitor that they have sought audience in all offices since they issued a notice to government in February but they have not received any response.  The industrial action is on. We have four days left. We had an agreement with government,  Mr Baguma said. The ultimatum expires on Monday when the school calendar opens for second term.Mr Patrick Muinda, the Ministry of Education spokesperson, said they had not received any information from the teachers on the industrial action. We have never received any ultimatum from teachers,  he said. On February 20, the teachers put government on a 90-day notice that they would lay down their tools unless they received positive response on salary increment.Earlier this month, they accused government of double standards. It is unfortunate teachers  issues have turned into a song on auto reply. Almost every financial year, teachers remind government about commitments earlier made. Do teachers really matter in this nation  Are commitments made by government mere boardroom gimmicks meant to silence teachers   Mr Baguma asked.He said the proposed salary increment for public servants will further deepen the salary inequality which will make supervision of teachers difficult and undermine delivery of quality education.While presenting the ministry s achievements in the past three years at the Prime Minister s office on Monday, Education minister Janet Museveni acknowledged that salaries for primary school teachers had not been increased for three consecutive years. There has been no salary enhancement for primary school teachers in the last three years because increment prior to Financial Year 2016/17 put them above the pay targets in the pay policy approved by Cabinet,  Ms Museveni said. She said the monthly salary for Grade III teachers had increased from Shs280,000 to Shs469,355. Resolution The teachers  leadership countrywide has today (yesterday) resolved to enter into an industrial action effective May 20 if there is no satisfactory feedback on issues pertaining to teachers  salary increment for 2019/2020. Notification was given to government in February expressing our intention to go on industrial action. Regrettably, no response has been received from government to date,  Unatu.Background The teachers negotiated their salary increment in 2011 following a sit-down strike that paralysed all public schools. The government team headed by the then prime minister, Mr Amama Mbabazi, promised a phased increment in three consecutive financial years. However, to date, the teachers are still asking government to fulfil this promise.

27,Government to borrow Shs1.7 trillion for oil roads - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The government has presented to Parliament a loan request of $456.37m (Shs1.7 trillion) to fund the upgrade and construction of national oil roads.The request presented Thursday by the Minister of State for Planning, Mr David Bahati, is to be obtained from China Exim Bank.Once approved, the money will see the construction of roads under package 1, 2 and 3, covering a total stretch of 363 kilometres.The total contract sum for the three packages is $536.92m (Shs2.02 trillion).The deputy Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Oulanyah, referred the matter to the House Committee on National Economy for scrutiny and recommendations.The committee is expected to report back within a period of 45 days.In the proposal, the government premises its request on the projection of having its first commercial oil available by 2020. In order to achieve this target, key enabling infrastructure, such as road network, must be in place,  reads in part the letter addressed to the Speaker.The total projection for oil roads is 700 kms.In March, government signed a contract with China Railway Seventh Group to design and construct a 97 km road connecting Masindi-Biso, Kabaale-Kizirafumdi and Hohwa-Nyairongo-Kyarushesha-Butole.Mr Mark Sali, the head of public and corporate affairs at the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), said:  The benefit of the loan is that Unra will be able to finance the construction of these roads quickly and get them ready to facilitate oil production.  If Parliament approves the loan, government will only be left with three packages; 4, 5 and 6, which cover a total of 301 kms.Beneficiary roadsPackage (1) includes the  design and construction of Masindi (Kisanja)-Park Junction and Tangi (Pakwach) junction-Paraa-Buliisa and Wanseko-Bugungu roads upgrading projects, measuring about 159 kms. Package (2) on the other hand involves  Civil Works for the upgrading of Hoima-Butiaba-Wanseko road, measuring 111 kms to paved standard. Package (3) involves the construction of Buhimba-Nalweyo-Bulamagi and Bulamagi-Igayaza-Kakumiro roads measuring 93 kms.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-to-borrow-Shs1-7-trillion-oil-roads/688334-5119088-6hhjhnz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post31.png
28,Ukraine to inaugurate comedian Zelensky as president - Daily Monitor,"Comedian Volodymyr Zelensky steps into his new role as Ukrainian president with his inauguration on Monday, launching a new era for the country wracked by war and economic difficulties.A month after scoring a landslide victory against incumbent Petro Poroshenko in polls, the 41-year-old becomes Ukraine's youngest post-Soviet president. He will swear an oath in a ceremony starting at 0700 GMT. According to tradition, he will place his hand on a copy of the constitution and possibly also a Bible.He will then give an address to the nation that will be closely watched for clues on his future course.So far little is known about his precise policies after a campaign that capitalised on public disillusionment with the political establishment and promised to ""break the system"".Uniquely for a first-time president, Zelensky has played the scene before -- for laughs. He starred as a history teacher who was unexpectedly elected president in the comedy series ""Servant of the People"".Just a few months ago, the idea that Zelensky would be inaugurated for real seemed equally unlikely. When the actor and comedian announced his candidacy on December 31, few took it seriously, but after an unprecedented campaign largely waged through social media, he won more than 73 percent in the second round on April 21, trouncing Poroshenko.Poroshenko led Ukraine for five years, overseeing the fallout over Russia's annexation of Crimea and armed conflict with Moscow-backed separatists in the country's East that has caused some 13,000 deaths.Poroshenko averted complete collapse and launched a series of key reforms but was widely criticised for failing to improve Ukrainians' living standards or effectively fight all-pervasive corruption.Country needs changesZelensky has vowed to continue the country's pro-Western course but beyond that his programme is still sketchy and his team largely unknown. His critics question how he will deal with the enormous challenges of the separatist conflict and ongoing economic problems.The leader of one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in Ukraine's industrial Donbass region, Denis Pushilin, on Friday told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that he was ""ready for dialogue"" with the new authorities in Kiev, ""naturally taking into account the interests of Donbass"".Nevertheless he condemned what he called ""destructive"" statements by Zelensky's team and accused Kiev of ""blocking the peace process"" which has long stalled.Also under question is whether Zelensky will be able to govern without a parliamentary majority. Even setting a date for his inauguration took weeks of negotiations, with Zelensky exasperatedly calling lawmakers ""petty crooks"".Zelensky has threatened to dissolve the parliament and hold snap elections before the set date in October to benefit from his current popularity. But lawmakers are determined to thwart his efforts in launching the complex process.""The country needs changes and fundamental reforms,"" the president-elect's team said in a statement on Friday. ""This is the demand of the Ukrainian people. And for that, we need a parliament that functions.""Ukraine's allies have given Zelensky a warm welcome, but one Ukrainian site specialising in international affairs, Evropeyska Pravda, suggested this was a ""hug strategy"" to ensure he continued to pursue a rapprochement with the West.The new president will immediately have to deal with a number of sensitive international issues, giving him a foretaste of the challenges lying ahead.Three days after Zelensky's election, the Kremlin announced it was easing procedures for those living in the eastern separatist regions to gain Russian citizenship. Many observers in Kiev saw this as Moscow issuing a challenge to Zelensky and he strongly condemned the move.In a sign of possible tensions between Kiev and Washington, Ukraine's key ally against Moscow, US President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani this month cancelled a visit to Kiev, saying Zelensky is ""surrounded by people who are enemies of the (US) president.""The febrile political situation prompted one pro-Western lawmaker, Serguiy Vysotsky, to warn Zelensky that the inauguration ""isn't the end of your adventures -- it's just the beginning"".",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Ukraine-comedian-Zelensky-president-Russia-Crimea/688340-5122770-13guir4z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post32.png
29,"Trump: if Tehran attacks, it will be 'official end of Iran' - Daily Monitor","President Donald Trump issued an ominous warning to Iran on Sunday, suggesting that if the Islamic republic attacks American interests, it will be destroyed.""If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again,"" Trump said in a tweet.Tensions between Washington and Tehran have been on the rise as the United States has deployed a carrier group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf over what it termed Iranian ""threats."" This account has been met with widespread skepticism outside the United States.The White House has sent mixed signals in recent days, amid multiple US media reports of infighting in Trump's cabinet over how hard to push Washington's arch foe Iran.The Trump administration has ordered non-essential diplomatic staff out of Iraq, citing threats from Iranian-backed Iraqi armed groups, and sent an aircraft carrier and heavy B-52 bombers to the region.On Sunday, a Katyusha rocket was fired into Baghdad's Green Zone housing government offices and embassies including the US mission. It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack.According to US media reports, Trump's long-hawkish national security advisor John Bolton is pushing a hard line on Iran, but others in the administration are resisting.Trump himself said recently that he has to ""temper"" Bolton.Iran's foreign minister downplayed the prospect of a new war in the region on Saturday, saying Tehran opposed it and no party was under the ""illusion"" the Islamic republic could be confronted.""We are certain... there will not be a war since neither we want a war nor does anyone have the illusion they can confront Iran in the region,"" Mohammad Javad Zarif told state-run news agency IRNA at the end of a visit to China.Iran-US relations hit a new low last year as US Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed unilateral sanctions that had been lifted in exchange for Tehran scaling back its nuclear program.Saudi Arabia called Sunday for emergency regional talks to discuss the mounting Gulf tensions, saying that it does not want war with Iran but is ready to defend itself.It comes days after mysterious sabotage attacks on several tankers in highly sensitive Gulf waters and drone strikes on a Saudi crude pipeline by Yemen rebels who Riyadh claimed were acting on Iranian orders.King Salman invited Gulf leaders and Arab League member states to two emergency summits in Mecca on May 30 to discuss recent ""aggressions and their consequences"", the kingdom's official SPA news agency reported late Saturday.Saudi Arabia's minister of state for foreign affairs, Adel al-Jubeir, said Sunday his country does not want to go to war with Iran but would defend itself.Saudi Arabia ""does not want a war, is not looking for it and will do everything to prevent it,"" he said.""But at the same time, if the other side chooses war, the kingdom will respond with strength and determination to defend itself and its interests.""The kingdom's regional allies welcomed the Saudi invitation. The United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry said the current ""critical circumstances"" require a unified Arab and Gulf stance.Oil producing countries met Sunday in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to stabilise a volatile oil market amid the rising US-Iran tensions, which threaten to disrupt global supply.Oil supplies are sufficient and stockpiles still rising despite massive output drops from Iran and Venezuela, said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates said at the meeting in Jeddah.Childish regimesQatar Sunday weighed in on the escalating tensions, saying it did not believe the US or Iran wanted a war in the region. ""US President Donald Trump has said he does not want war, and I do not think Iran wants war or instability in the region,"" minister of state for foreign affairs Sultan al-Muraikhi told AFP on the sidelines of a Qatar Fund for Development briefing.""I think if we move away from the childish regimes in the region, all troubles will be settled.""Muraikhi said Doha -- which remains isolated by neighboring former allies in a long-running diplomatic dispute -- has not yet received a formal invitation to either meeting. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt are among the countries that cut ties with Qatar in June 2017 over accusations it supports terrorism and seeks closer ties with Tehran. Four ships including two Saudi oil tankers were damaged in mysterious sabotage attacks last Sunday off the UAE's Fujairah, near the Strait of Hormuz -- a vital maritime route for oil exports which Iran has threatened to close in the event of a war.That incident was followed by drone strikes Tuesday claimed by Yemen's Iran-aligned rebels on a major Saudi oil pipeline built as an alternative export route if the Strait of Hormuz were to be closed.Saudi Arabia accused Tehran of ordering the pipeline attacks, targeting ""the security of oil supplies... and the global economy"".

30,Saudi Arabia deposits $250 million in Sudan's central bank - Daily Monitor,"Saudi Arabia announced Sunday it deposited $250 million in Sudan's central bank as part of a support package for the country following the overthrow of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.""The ministry of finance has deposited 937.5 million Saudi riyals into the central bank of Sudan,"" it said in a statement. In April, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced three billion dollars (2.7 billion euros) in financial aid for Sudan. ""$500 million has been provided by both countries... to strengthen its financial position,"" the kingdom's finance ministry said. The UAE said on April 28 it was depositing $250 million in Sudan's central bank.The oil-rich Gulf states pledged to inject $500 million into Sudan's central bank and $2.5 billion to help provide food, medicine and petroleum products, the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said last month.It said the move was aimed shoring up the Sudanese pound.In recent years Sudan has been hit by an acute lack of dollars, a key factor behind the nationwide protests that first erupted in December and led to the toppling of Bashir by the army last month.Sudan plays a key role in the regional interests of Saudi Arabia and its allies, siding with Riyadh against Shiite Iran and providing troops in the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen's war.Both Gulf nations have voiced backing for Sudan's military rulers, who are facing calls from protesters to cede power to a civilian transitional government.The Sudanese currency had plunged even after the United States lifted its 20-year-old trade embargo on the country in October 2017.Expectations that the end of US sanctions would bring an economic recovery failed to materialise, putting pressure on the pound.The country's economic crisis has deepened since the secession of South Sudan in 2011 that took away the bulk of oil earnings.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Saudi-Arabia-deposits--250-million-Sudan-s-central-bank/688340-5122366-afgub5z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post34.png
31,Sudan protesters insist on civilian head for new governing body - Daily Monitor,"Sudanese protest leaders said Sunday they will insist a civilian runs a planned new governing body in new talks with army rulers, as Islamists warn against excluding sharia from the political roadmap.The Alliance for Freedom and Change is determined that the country's new ruling body be ""led by a civilian as its chairman and with a limited military representation"", it said in a statement.The protesters' umbrella group said talks would resume with the military council -- which has ruled Sudan since president Omar al-Bashir was deposed on April 11 -- at 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) on Sunday.Talks over a transfer of power by the generals have repeatedly stalled, resulting in international pressure to return to the table after the generals suspended negotiations earlier this week.The generals insist the new body be military-led but the protest leaders demand a majority civilian body.On Sunday the protest movement raised the ante by insisting that the ruling body should be headed by a civilian.The military council is headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the generals have previously said he would lead the new governing body.Before talks were suspended the two sides had agreed on several key issues, including a three-year transition period and the creation of a 300-member parliament, with two thirds of lawmakers to come from the protesters' umbrella group.The previous round of talks was marred by violence after five protesters and an army major were shot dead near the ongoing sit-in outside the military headquarters in central Khartoum, where thousands have camped out for weeks.Initially, the protesters gathered to demand Bashir resign -- but they have stayed put, to pressure the generals into stepping aside.The protesters had also erected roadblocks on some avenues in Khartoum, paralysing large parts of the capital, to put further pressure on the generals during negotiations, but the miliary rulers suspended the last round of talks and demanded the barriers be removed.Protesters duly took the roadblocks down in recent days -- but they warn they will put them back up, if the army fails to transfer power to a civilian administration.The generals have allowed protesters to maintain their sit-in outside Khartoum's army headquarters.Islamists' warning Islamic movements rallied outside the presidential palace on Saturday night, to reject any civilian administration that excludes sharia as its guiding principle.Hundreds took part in the rally, the first organised mobilisation by Islamist groups since Bashir's ouster.""The main reason for the mobilisation is that the alliance (the main protesters' umbrella group) is ignoring the application of sharia in its deal,"" said Al-Tayieb Mustafa, who heads a coalition of about 20 Islamic groups.""This is irresponsible and if that deal is done, it is going to open the door of hell for Sudan,"" he told AFP.Bashir came to power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989 and Sudanese legislation has since been underpinned by Islamic law.At Saturday's rally, hardline cleric Mohamed Ali Jazuli had a warning for the military council. ""If you consider handing over power to a certain faction, then we will consider it a coup"", he vowed as supporters chanted ""Allahu Akbar"".The protest leaders have so far remained silent on whether sharia has a place in Sudan's future, arguing that their main concern is installing a civilian administration.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Sudan-protesters-civilian-body-Fattah-al-Burhan/688340-5122270-ytptqiz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post35.png

33,Ocaya to bring his car dream to life - Daily Monitor,"Born to Silverno Orinyo from Zombo, Matthias Ocaya, 25, is one of the innovators in the vocational field, thanks to his persistence. An old student of Otoroga Boys Primary School in Zombo, Ocaya started dreaming about joining vocational education then, but his father would not hear any of it.  After Primary Seven, I told my father that I wanted to enroll in a vocational institute although he wanted me to continue to secondary school. So, I joined St Aloysius Secondary School in Zombo District and while there, my knowledge on innovation developed,  Ocaya recalls. He got career guidance and learned that he could actually go enroll in a vocational school after O-Level.  Whenever we got holidays, I would go to different people in my village for apprenticeship in plumbing work, building and wiring. I did that from Senior One holidays to Senior Four. In Senior Four vacation, I built myself a house and since I wanted to make a door for it, I went to a certain carpenter in my village to ask him for his equipment,  he says. But the carpenter instead asked him to come and help him at his workshop since he had no one to work with. Ocaya started work the following day.  I made my door but also learnt more skills, so, next, I made myself a bed but before I could take it home, a buyer asked for it. I told him I could make him one and he paid me Shs200,000. This was the first money I earned and through him, I got many more customers,  he narrates. Although Ocaya did carpentry work, being a mechanic was his ultimate dream. After Senior Four vacation, he still expressed interest in vocational education but his father still did not want him to go.  I joined A-Level at Paidha Senior Secondary School but class things had gotten a bit slow for me. I looked for a garage in the area where I would work at the weekend and during the holiday. It was then that I thought about making a prototype of a car from timber,  he says. Realising his dreamWith six points after A-Level, he joined vocational school. Ocaya joined Lugogo Vocational Institute in Kampala in 2016.  Two weeks into the course, I went to my lecturer and told him I wanted to build a car. He asked me how I was going to do it and told me to write a proposal with all the details and to also draw what I wanted to make. He also asked me whether I would be able to pull it off,  Ocaya explains. In first year, when real life projects were introduced and they were asked to make stoves, Ocaya had bigger fish to fry in mind.  In second year when they told us to build something, I just wanted to build a car. I already had my proposal and I told the teacher that I wanted to make a car, but he said that could not work. I went and talked to the head of department, who gave me a go ahead,  he recalls.Financial constraitsOcaya had no money. So during holidays, he went to the village and found work.  I earned Shs150,000 which I used to buy some things such as a motor, magnetar and other things for my prototype.  Ocaya spent two and a half months building the car in addition to building and designing things such as DC stoves, water pumps and a car heater for friends in order to get money for his prototype. After completing his prototype, he took it to the teacher and showed off his dream. The prototype was a solar driven car with an external steering wheel which he could use to control its movements.  But because I had a tuition debt, I went back to the village to look for money. From there, I was called by the principal for a vocational exhibition at Parliament in November 2017. I was also allowed to do my examinations. But when I went back to the village with my Shs400,000 that I had got from people who saw my innovation at the exhibition, I decided to build a big car which I am currently working on but won t give a lot of details about it for now,  Ocaya asserts.  I was also recently invited to an exhibition at UBTEB, where I exhibited my car before the Education minister Janet Museveni. But as I work on my big project, I also work in a garage in my village because I still have a debt at school,  he says. Ocaya needs about Shs95m to build his first big prototype of a solar driven car. Other student innovationsTogether with his robotics team, the International University of East Africa students built a car surveillance system. Andrew Bakashaba said, this is a smart home surveillance system that will have multiple functions. It will be able to; pick up sound, take videos, see what is at a distance, will be able to detect obstacles and able to control the lighting system in a home using a timer. It will also be able to pick feedback, move for example in a compound or house and do all those functions. I specifically did the parking coding that detects obstacles. We have built a control module/app that is connected to a mobile app, so it can connect everywhere, plus the camera module. We are still working on that body to adopt to functions and implement some parts but we want to have a working prototype soon. The surveillance car works as a proof of concept that we can build our own robots without studying a specific course.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Ocaya-car-dream-to-life-carpentry-work-Zombo-District/688336-5112776-rvg9my/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post38.png
34,Want to boost your career  Read - Daily Monitor,"Gives me confidenceMy job is to sell knowledge, history and tell a story the clients have no idea about. This has taught me to read constantly. Everyday I read something in relation to travel. Before taking any person to the site, I visit it first, make research and buy any written literature about it. I read any travel literature I come across naturally. I even read about the different Christian historical sites. I may not necessarily buy a book, but I carry out research and read online. This has opened my mind and widened my knowledge about different cultures. When I am talking to people; I speak with confidence because I am sure about what I am telling them. Mary Josephina Nanyonga, tours and travel dealerMotivated my career choiceMy reading journey started while in primary school. I enjoyed reading fictional stories such as Mr Hare tales because I found them entertaining. While in secondary school I would visit the school library to read novels during my free time. I read a book titled To Be the Best by Barbara Taylor which motivated me to aim higher and opened me up to more of her work such as A woman of Substance, which inspired me to pursue a career in finance. Currently, I read mathematics-related articles and mainly motivational books. My current read is Nice Girls Don t Get the Corner Office which talks about unconscious mistakes women make that sabotage their careers.Ann Kyakuwaire, auditorReading makes me practicalKyamanywa handles civil law cases to do with property, family issues that entail divorce, annulment, child custody. Because of his choice of work, he says his reading is not about to end. To manage handling the different cases I realised I need to have an inquisitive mind, excellent analytical skills and the ability to think.  At times clients expect an immediate answer. With this I came to a conclusion that lawyers need to be good readers. I read books such as Civil rights and Liberties in the 21 century, In Our Defense. The Civil Rights book gives an analysis of the Supreme Court s landmark rulings on civil rights and liberties. Reading has made me resourceful to my clients, taught me new court presentations and has helped me improve on my vocabulary. However, it calls for commitment. Currently, I am reading My Life in Court by Louise Nizer. Edward Cooper Kyamanywa, lawyerBroadened my thinkingMy reading culture started at the age of 10. In those early years I read a lot of adventure books. I would literally feel as if I was on the same adventure journey as the characters in the book. As a teen, I began reading literature from authors such as Jeffrey Archer, Wilbur Smith and Danielle Steele, which helped me understand new concepts about life and my vocabulary. While in high school he was introduced to African authors such as Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and others whose works gave him a new understanding of the continent. Today, I read different genres of literature, popular psychology, faith-based books, biographies, African books on history and economics, leadership and management books, motivational books. Reading has broadened my mind. I am able to know and understand a variety of topics. Currently, I am reading Purple Cow by Seth Godin, which is about avoiding being average. If you want to develop a reading culture, start slowly with one book at a time, those that you will enjoy, as well as joining a book club.Stirling Gapara, leadership and management consultantEnlightened meAmos Wekesa s reading culture did not develop until 2001 when he committed to reading for two hours a day. Reading different literature such as Transformation of Singapore from third world to second world, Problems of Africa, he says his reading kept improving. When reading, I spare 45 minute to read about a topic I am involved in. This has given me leverage over many people who come to me for information. I was influenced into reading by my wife. My wife is a good reader and so are my children. I realised if I did not read I would remain the idiot of the family. Writing has also given me an opportunity to read. The more you write, the more you read.Amos Wekesa, tourism entrepreneurKeeps my brain activeMy father used to read a lot. When I was a child, he would read to me story books written in Rutooro. Slowly, I began to broaden my reading scope. When I joined Nyakasura School, I started a newspaper called The Student. But today, I read medicine-related material, I read about the latest advances, news about medicine and I do a lot of research.  I keep tickling my brain by reading all the necessary literature within my profession and others I find relevant. Vincent Karuhanga, doctorLeaders are readers Leaders are readers. If you want to be a leader then you must be a reader. If you want to excel in any field such as being a politician or fashion designer you have to be a long-life learner and reader.  In life there has to be continuous improvement in all that we do. And the way you can improve is to continuously read.   If the last time you read a book was the time you graduated from university, yet you have been working for the last five years, it means you are stunted. As an educationist, I read constantly. I believe, the more you read, the better you become. Through reading I have been mentored by different people I admire but can never have conversations with. My recent great read has been by Michelle Obama s, Becoming. But currently I am reading The 15 Rules of Growth by John Maxwell. He says growth is intentional, not accidental. To inspire my children to read, each time any of them reads a book I put Shs10,000 in their piggy bank.

35,"Digital libraries, game-changer in rural schools - Daily Monitor","In October last year, Nyombi Thembo, the director Rural Communications Development Fund at the Uganda Communications Commission, announced government would introduce video conferencing lessons aimed at connecting rural schools to their urban counterparts. According to Thembo, the move is aimed at providing rural and urban students the same learning opportunities. We want a situation where a good Mathematics teacher in St Mary s College, Kisubi is giving a lesson, and some 100 rural schools in Karamoja following this lesson,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries. To support the move, National Social Security Fund (NSSF) has injected more than Shs450m to provide tablets to mainly underpriviledged secondary schools so as to compete favourably with priviledged schools.While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation, owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries. To support the move, National Social Security Fund (NSSF), has injected more than Shs450m to provide tablets to mainly underpriviledged secondary schools so as to compete favourably with priviledged schools. While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent, especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.So far, the Fund has donated at least 440 digital learning tablets to 11 schools with each school receiving 40 tablets. The project is expected to benefit more than 3,500 students in Senior Four and Senior Six in the next one year and more than 5,200 students in the next two years. Aggrey Kibenge, the Under Secretary in the Ministry of Education and Sports, says the initiative will help students in underpriviledged schools to rise up to the occasion and compete favourably with their counterparts in priviledged schools.  Students in schools that do not have access to modern learning facilities will get exposure to and access modern learning resources and tools. I look forward to a time when all secondary schools will benefit from this type of digital technology to transform teaching and learning,  he said.Infrastructure issuesSanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher of Mpummudde Seed Secondary School, said he is supportive of the project and hopes it will help in reducing the workload for teachers and expose students to a wide range of learning materials as well as the digital world.However, he expressed worry that due to limited space in some government-aided schools for instance, as a result of the surging numbers in student population, buildings to house digital libraries must be put up.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space for this digital library. My teachers do not have where to sit because the staffroom is now occupied with the tablets,  he lamented. James Asili, the head of department for secondary schools and coordinator of the Digital Library project at NCDC, is optimistic that the tablet will prepare students for a digital curriculum with multiple content. The tablet costs Shs600,000 but Asili is hopeful that the cost will reduce with time. How the tablet works Ivan Mukasa, the software engineer in charge of the digital library project, says the digital tablets have been tailored to the school curriculum inclusive of all subjects for both O and A levels.  The tablet has been fitted with virtual learn software that incorporates the curriculum for both O and A levels. Each subject follows topics as designed in the curriculum. We shall keep modifying it to suit the students  needs,  he reveals.He further explains,  At the end of each topic, a student can do a self-assessment basing on the three levels of assessment. If the student fails the assessment, they are advised to retake and complete it. All the students  work and assessments are stored on the cloud for review by teachers as well as NCDC officials for analysis on how students are progressing in different subjects, for instance by analysing the difficult and easy topics.    It is also designed with an e-book readers  icon which enables students to buy online text books and read on their own. The virtual learn also permits performance tracking by schools and parents that can be accessed on Android mobile phones,  Mukasa adds.The tablet can be used both online and offline. Even better, a solar backpack has been provided in cases of power blackout or shortages.  At first the goal was to develop a virtual lab for sciences but then later we agreed to incorporate both arts and sciences. Students can even tap into the syllabus and read ahead of the teacher and do assessments.  Students react Hendrick Oboth, a Senior Six student, says he is enthusiastic about the digital library and hopes it will improve his learning.  I have realised there are things teachers fail to explain well in class but which you can read and understand on the tablets on your own. Similarly, Doreen Mugala, a Senior Four student, says it will ease her studies and help her get more details through research.  I will also be able to acquire skills in ICT which I may require in future,  she hopefully says.Knowing how many rural school grapple with poorly stocked libraries or nonexistent libraries at all, digital libraries could be the timely intervention to bridge the gap between rural underprivildged schools and priviledged ones.Other edu-tabsKaino Africa, a smart school management tech company last year launched their flagship product, the Kaino Tablet crafted for the Ugandan primary pupil. This Education Technology (EdTech) tablet comes with curriculum aligned teacher guides that show the teacher lesson plans; how they are supposed to proceed with the class, what examples to give as well as time the lesson is supposed to start and end. It comes with well-prepared notes from Ugandan content providers, not to mention, it has offline and online past papers, exams and instant assessments at the end of the tests. All this comes in addition to digitalised text books that are cheap (between USD1 to USD10) (about Shs38,000).BeneficiariesThe beneficiary schools include: Mpummudde Secondary School in Jinja, Nabumali High School Mbale, Atutur Seed Secondary School in Soroti, Sir Tito Winyi Secondary School in Hoima, Kagamba Secondary School in Mbarara, Kyenjojo Secondary School in Fort Portal and St. Charles Lwanga SS, Kasasa in Masaka.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Digital-libraries-game-changer-rural-schools/688336-5101196-e93vek/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post40.png
36,Essay challenge brings students  knowledge on biotechnology to life - Daily Monitor,"In a bid to familiarise students with modern biotechnology, National Crop Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) organised the Biotechnology Essay Writing Contest among secondary and university students.Resty Nansubuga, the 17-year-old science student at St Joseph s Girls Senior Secondary School, who scooped the best essay award in the secondary school category, says she only learnt about plant breeding using modern biotechnology in a bid to develop Genetically Modified Organisms crops from her teacher recently.Her essay focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food under the theme;  Modern Biosciences for more nutritious food . She explained the use of breeding crops using advanced technology to develop improved varieties which have better nutrition and are high yielding hence capable of feeding the world s growing population.Organised by the Uganda Biosciences Information centre, the competition attracted several students who, like Nansubuga, had scanty knowledge about crop breeding. Widespread issueBut this lack of knowledge is also true in majority of Ugandans who are ignorant about plant breeding using modern biotechnology and mistake improved plant varieties such as hybrids with GMOs.Thus scientists at NaCRRI have put in efforts to sensitise school children right from primary to university level by organising essay competitions where the students are required to search for information about application of modern biotechnology in plant breeding. The 6th edition of the essay competition awardees were given certificates, plaques, laptops and a one-week internship training at NaCRRI.This was the first time most of the competing students were visiting the research institute and its laboratory where tissue culture cassava breeding is being done by breeding them in tests tubes. The students were also amazed to see tissue culture cassava growing from test tubes to a full plant in the field.Enlightened Nasubuga was excited to receive her award and promised to sensitise fellow students at her school and other communities on the importance of scientists using emerging technologies to breed crops. I do not see any difference between improved cassava, maize and rice varieties with the traditional varieties being tested at the institute. I have heard that many Ugandans are opposed to improved crop varieties but it seems people lack knowledge about what the scientists are doing,  she asserted. Students submitted essays under the topic modern Biosciences to produce better nutritious food while Nsubuga focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food citing orange sweet potato and cassava which is bred conventionally and pro vitamin A treangenic banana which contains Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.She is optimistic that she will encourage fellow students to read scientific books to get knowledge especially in Biosciences be it in crop breeding of applied science to developing vaccines and drugs in the health sector.For Marvin Steven Nsubuga, the overall winner in the tertiary and university category, this is his third time participating in the awards. He submitted his first essay in 2015 when he was a Senior Five student and won an accolade, a certificate and a one-week internship at the institute.Nsubuga, a first year Administrative Science student at Kyambogo University, researched on using applied modern biotechnology to breed crops which can be used as a raw material in order to boost the industrial sector. He focused on crops such cassava which farmers will be able to grow and get high yields which can be supplied to brewing industries.  The starch can also be used to process glue and highly processed cassava flour used by industries processing confectionary products. I am currently disseminating this information for government to make good policy,  he noted.On his third time competing, Nsubuga scooped a certificate, plaque, a laptop and a one week internship at the institute. More student researchHe is encouraging university students to be in search of scientific information, especially in agricultural science where scientists are breeding crops to address challenges of climate change and devising ways of feeding the growing population in the world.National Agricultural Research Organisation board chairman, Prof Joseph Obua, urged students to pursue science subjects because science is a driver and engine of economic growth of all nations. I am urging teachers to use the best methods when teaching science subjects; make it simple and practical. This is because children tend to shy away from science subjects because teachers are using complex words which scare them. It is important to simplify the words for students to appreciate science, technology and innovations,  he noted.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Essay-challenge-brings-students-knowledge-biotechnology-life-/688336-5101200-d2t4y2z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post41.png
37,Startup tips crucial to vocational students - Daily Monitor,"One of the major challenges vocational graduates face is lack of start-up capital despite being trained to be job creators not seekers. This sometimes forces them to end up in the job seekers pool which their training was trying to avoid.For a long time, Sophie Joyce Laker, a Fashion and Design student at Kitgum Technical Institute, would worry about starting a business citing lack of money. What Laker did not know though, was that mindset is the first capital and for as long as one s brain is functional, they can do anything they set out to do. She also came to learn that an entrepreneur must not keep complaining about challenges such as rent and delays in supplies but rather always devise solutions. The Fashion and Design student has since started a business; Rwot-Twero Workshop in Kitgum Town. But it was not until the Skills for Life programme recently that Laker realised all this and more about mentorship in business.Thirty youthful entrepreneurs from Kitgum Technical Institute and Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute in Gulu, received training in business start-ups and expansion skills from Enterprise Uganda experts, to ensure their dreams are realised. Subsequent follow-up visits to measure their progress coupled with mentorship have been ongoing since. Funded by Uganda Breweries (UBL), this expert training and mentoring under the Skills for Life programme aims at avoiding this. Launched in 2001, the programme has so far seen more than 114 scholarships awarded to academically deserving yet economically disadvantaged students with the aim of curbing youth unemployment and high school dropouts.The problemUganda s small and medium scale businesses are estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000; employing 2.5 million people (about 90 per cent of private sector jobs) and contributing about 20 per cent to the country s Gross Domestic Product, while producing 80 per cent of manufactured output. In fact, studies have ranked Uganda as one of the most entrepreneurial nations in the world. However, the business failure rate is equally high   standing at more than 50 per cent. This is due to various challenges, including lack of financial support and vital skills including entrepreneurial, management, marketing and financial planning. Other challenges include lack of business records, low corporate governance, poor banking and borrowing history, a culture that disrespects business contracts, fierce local and international competition and limited access to business development services.In fact Anjijuka Narasi Kambaho, the senior information and communication officer at Uganda Business and Technical Examinations Board, says starting personal businesses is not always easy for vocational trained graduates. There are expenses involved including purchasing the necessary equipment, paying rent and the required licenses needed for operation. Sometimes people want to first get formal jobs in order save and accumulate money for starting their own businesses later,  he says.Registered successAt Enterprise Uganda, a public-private institution aimed at promoting SMEs as the main vehicle for expanding production, providing sustainable jobs and enhancing economic growth, the Acholi youth are likely to avoid falling on the wayside like many similar businesses countrywide.  The mindset and entrepreneurship training model is an effective standard in transforming the behaviour of participants and triggering the desired action to start a business. This is corroborated by the statistic where 26 out of the 30 students actually started business after the December 2018 training, representing a 87 per cent success rate,  says Rosemary Mutyabule, the lead trainer. One such students is Nelson Mandela, of Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute who believes his poultry business can help him contribute to his family and community. Located in Custom-Corner Village, Layibi Division in Gulu municipality, Mandela s farm has 235 22-days old broiler chicks, fully vaccinated in line with the requirements from the trainers. During a visit to assess his business last month, it was discovered that Mandela, who mainly sells to roadside chicken roasters in Gulu Town feels his enterprise is delivering tangible benefits. He has earned Shs1.9m in chicken sales from his first stock giving him a profit of Shs300,000.  This poultry business is giving me a sense of purpose in life. I even sell the chicken droppings and earn at least Shs5,000 every 100kg sack,  Mandela says. Paul Otim, a Gulu-based business counsellor and mentor, who assessed Mandela s farm, believes, that though new, the enterprise has great potential to grow given the market opportunities available and the determination of the young entrepreneur.  A planned farm exposure visit will undoubtedly reinforce his potential to develop the business, especially on technical methods of handling the poultry, cost saving using local resources plus proper records management,  says Otim. Follow-upBroadly, the Skills for Life programme does not stop at the training or skilling phase, but the beneficiaries undergo various follow-up visits by the implementers who ensure the trainees  learning and development is in fulfillment of the programme s objectives.The latest additions to this initiative are 20 students of Kabale s African College of Commerce and Technology and another 20 from Datamine Institute in Kampala for whom UBL has provided up to about Shs115m to cover tuition for their second year of study, entrepreneurship training as well as seed capital for those that would have excelled in the programme.And for Sunday Auma Okee, an Electrical Systems and Maintenance student at Kitgum Technical Institute, the scholarship, aside from helping him stay in school, has helped him learn to start a business with what he has and in fact his dream of opening an electrical workshop seems closer. Interventions Edward Asiimwe, the principal at Uganda Rural Development and Training institute, says policy makers, the government in particular needs to support vocational training at all levels.  Just like in other education sectors, increased funding and investment is also mandatory in vocational institutions.  In addition, Asiimwe believes that students need to be continuously given the proper career guidance to enable them make better informed academic choices.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Startup-tips-crucial-vocational-students/688336-5101216-aaicob/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post42.png
38,"Influx of private schools, what s the catch  - Daily Monitor","Joseph Byaruhanga, earns Shs300,000 per month as a security guard. He has a family of three children to cater for, as well as paying other bills. His first two children attend a nearby private primary school in Namasuba, Zanna where he pays fees of Shs170,000 for each child totaling to Shs340,000 a term. Apart from tuition, he has to buy scholastic materials and other fees as directed by the school. Byaruhanga is not your rich parent but he sure is among the growing list of parents who year by year join the private schools trend as the best way to educate their children.  The problem with universal primary education schools is that the population in class is too high. It is possible to find more than 200 pupils in one class. Private schools have a small teacher to pupil ratio. You will find 50 pupils in a class which is manageable. A child in a class of many pupils will not learn anything and might take long to understand,  Byaruhanga says. In 1997, government introduced Universal Primary Education. Under this arrangement, four children in every family were to study free of charge in all government-aided primary schools. Almost 10 years after UPE, the government introduced Universal Secondary Education becoming the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education. But despite this, parents are increasingly parting with huge sums of money to educate their children in private schools. As such numbers of private schools increase each year.According to the Uganda Schools Guide website, as of today there are more than 13,000 private schools in 127 districts in Uganda. Among the private schools are the high end ones that offer foreign curriculums and target wealthy parents and the ones that target middle income earners. The endless challenges plaguing most public schools have increasingly eroded public confidence. They have been labelled as for the  poor  forcing some parents to take children to private schools where they hope to find better education for their children.The increase in enrollment of students has not only accelerated a rise in private schools across the country; but also the cost of education. Overwhelming numbersIn January 2018, Alex Kakooza, the permanent secretary of Ministry of Education and Sports while at the Senior One selection exercise at Uganda Manufacturers Association grounds announced that government had scrapped Universal Secondary Education in private schools under the Public Private Partnership (PPP). At the peak was a challenge of funding and an increasing number of ghost students. This did not go down well with parents who had fear of transferring their children to public schools for the USE programme dreading the appalling conditions of overcrowding. For instance, at Masindi Secondary School, a government funded school, students study in shifts; some in the morning to noon while others from 2pm to evening. According to Byaruhanga,  Some parents take their children to UPE schools because the tuition is relatively lower there. Personally I do not have much money but I want my children to at least have a good education. I would rather pay in installments to make sure that my children study in a private school. But the move to scrap USE from private schools was intended to raise money and ensure that every sub county has a public school. According to Kakooza, more than 615 government sub-counties had no secondary schools. At the time, government would pay Shs47,000 for each student per term in a private school under the USE programme. Mpumudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District is one of the new schools established by government to create equity in providing education across the country. However, since its establishment, the school is still housed in Mpumudde Primary School buildings with a few new classroom blocks. Sanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher, recently expressed worry over a surging student population with no facilities while at the launch of a digital library at the school.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space where to put this digital library. My teachers have nowhere to sit because the staffroom is now full of digital tablets,  he said.  We want extra building materials and land for expansion and creation of access roads and a laboratory with chemicals and equipment,  he added.Aggrey Kibenge, the undersecretary at the Ministry of Education and Sports who was the chief guest at the event gave a one worded response.  We shall look into the matter at the ministry.  High price to pay With appalling conditions in both public primary and secondary schools, private schools have been increasing over time to attend to the needs of frustrated parents but at a much higher cost.According to the ministry of Education, the Private Schools and Institutions department was inaugurated in 2008, consequent to the restructuring of the ministry to cater for the ever expanding private investment in education. Since the government decision to liberalise the education sector in 1993, thousands of schools and institutions have been set up by private investors. In the secondary sub-sector, the number of private schools, at about 4,000, is more than double the number of government-funded schools. Light Academy on Entebbe road is one such private school that specifically cater for the middle class who can afford the fees. Mahad Budda, a student at Light Academy (former Turkish), says the school charges between Shs1.8m and Shs2m per term and the fees increase termly. However, he says, the services are worth the money because the teacher-student ratio is low with each class stream having between 28 and 32 students. He adds that the sickbay is good with fulltime nurses as well as better accommodation.Other private schools around Kampala and Wakiso districts charge between Shs500,000 and Shs2m as tuition fees for either day or boarding section. Scraped fundingAt the start of 2018, the ministry of Education scrapped funding to 792 private secondary schools which had been implementing the Universal Secondary Education programme. The ministry officials argued that the government has built capacity over the years in areas where they did not have any government-aided schools and are now ready to absorb those students in these institutions, adding that this, however, will be done in phases. The move left an estimated number of students who were expected to benefit from the Public Private Partnership in Senior One stranded.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/private-schools-children-UPE-a-laboratory-parents/688336-5112742-11d5ivi/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post43.png
39,The right time to get a master s degree - Daily Monitor,"There is an increase in the number of universities in the country, making it easy for one to acquire qualifications. And as such many young people are going for graduate studies soon after their undergraduate qualifications, and as with many issues, this, too, has its advantages and disadvantages. Before Rosta Asiimwe completed her undergraduate degree in Human Nutrition, she had applied for a Masters in Public Health Nutrition.  I worked on-and-off for five months with research organisations. That little experience motivated me to take my master s degree seriously. Previously, I was just going through the motions but then I became interested in research. Besides, the pay is good in research work. The advantage of rushing into a postgraduate programme early is that you are still young and have the time to concentrate. On the downside, you tend to continue in the same course you began at undergraduate level. Gaining work experience opens the mind to a variety of career choices. The merits of growing your career first Spending a few years in the work arena can help a person focus their career goals. Grace Kenganzi, who has a Bachelor s degree in Mass Communication, undertook a postgraduate in Media and Communications after working for more than three years in a media house.  By that time, I was sure of the experience I wanted to attain   the kind that I could not get from my workplace. I had majored in public relations in my undergraduate course and since I worked for a media organisation, I had learnt on the job. I was more deliberate as I looked for a postgraduate course; I did not want just any media course because in the future, I want to branch into communication,  said Kenganzi.Samuel Bakutana, the chief executive officer Inspired Leaders International, says by concentrating on growing a career, a person comes to terms with the real demands of the job world, instead of making up their mind based on what they are told in the lecture room.  The working experience gives you a more mature perspective. By the time I went for my Master s in Leadership, I was already aware of the glaring gaps, the available opportunities and the needs of my future work. I approached the studies with a more mature, sober and committed attitude,  he says, adding:  A working background enables you relate with the programme content at a more real, practical and personal level because you have gone through the scenarios (or have examples to draw from) being presented in the course materials as you progressively apply the new or renewed learning. The financial questionWhen you are younger, chances of getting a scholarship are higher than if you are above 35 years. However, all is not bleak.  There are specialised programmes, for example The Chevening Scholarship Programme, that only gives scholarships to people who have careers,  Kenganzi says, adding,  You can only know about them when you are working. If I studied my postgraduate much earlier, I would not have thought of studying abroad or applying for a scholarship. Generally, because a master s degree can be expensive and students may be uncertain about what they want to do with their lives, students should gain some real-world experience before beginning a master s degree programme.Fitting into the labour marketEmployers are comfortable employing someone who already has job experience because, from a purely financial perspective, training of new staff is expensive and may not pay off immediately. Kenganzi believes her work experience and her master s degree gives her an edge.  I know what I want and I will ask for it. I cannot just accept anything thrown my way.  Asiimwe is not so confident.  Getting a job will be quite tricky. In the Ugandan (labour) market, (work) experience is the password and I know those who have it have an advantage over me.

41,Have career conversations  at an early stage - Daily Monitor,"It had been an entire week of career guidance and counselling at the Gayaza-based Orel Vine International School for learners from Year One to 10, and to crown off the week, all learners were encouraged to dress in imitation of their future career aspirations. A number of students dressed in white overcoats as doctors, with mock stethoscopes around their necks, about two pupils clad in pilot suits, there is a fire fighter in the other corner, a chef, an artist with colourfully printed pants and a graffiti T-shirt, not to mention a makeup artist with her makeup kit in hand, among others. This, the teacher explains, is to create both identity and attachment to the children s future aspirations as well as open their minds to a wide rage of career options available so as to trigger career conversations between pupils and their parents, as well as their teachers. While we were growing up, the most important thing they used to tell us was,  go study hard, and you will get there. You will be someone!  and that is exactly what we did,  Angela Nambuya, a teacher at Orel Vine International School, reminisces. However, she realises that this can no longer work effectively in a world where children are exposed to a diversity of dreams.  We have been having discussions with pupils on how to select a career, the available career paths, after which, we told them to talk to their parents about career options they want to pursue in future because parents are a great influence when it comes to career choices. Their dressing today is a result of the career conversations that happened between the parents and the children,  Agnes Namirimu, a Year Two teacher at the same school, shares. The earlier the betterIt goes without saying that more schools are increasingly appreciating the role of career guidance at the lowest levels of education, and are taking steps in that direction.  During school holidays, we always organise free career guidance sessions for our learners and sometimes, parents to especially talk about the need for skilling our children. We want the two parties to realise that skills-based career options in vocational and technical fields are also as equally viable as academic-based careers,  Teo Mbabazi, the head teacher, Right Care Primary School, says. The school does this by inviting career guidance professionals and role models to share expertise and experiences, so as to inspire young learners. Role models to inspire Though the career week has been in the history of the school (Orel Vine International) it is parents that have always been invited to talk to the students about their careers. This time around, professionals from across the board were invited. Among these was a doctor, engineer, journalist, army (UPDF soldiers). Why now  As a parent living in the  now  it is important that I know what is in the mind of my child when it comes to careers, but also, to help them discover themselves, based on their passions and strengths. After identifying this, I know then how to make them get there,  Rehema Nalwanga Mulindwa says. She gives an example of her six-year-old daughter who goes to Greenhill Academy, Kibuli whom she enrolled for piano lessons at Kampala Music School during holidays after realising she loved music. My attitude is, it is never too early to pursue your dreams. I want that for my child,  she says. Davis Bamukunde, a career guidance counsellor at Inspire Business Consults, shares that when children have a career path they are looking at, it becomes easy for parents, educators and the children themselves to focus or be refocused on their aspirations.  This has nothing to do with how fancy a career is or sounds, but even if a child s aspiration is to become a footballer, it is always easy to make them do things that will better them, guide them on which things would be best in enabling them reach where they want to be. Though these career aspirations can change as children grow up, it is better than having a child who has no idea why they are even in school,  he says. Enlightenment Having the conversations on career with a child gives one a platform to teach them how the world of work actually works.  I remember having a student who was very good with Music Dance and Drama but also wanted to become a teacher. In his mind, though he wanted both careers, he thought he only had to choose one of the two. But since we were having this conversation, I got to explain to him that he could actually do both because the world we are living in needs multiple skilled people,  Bamukunde elaborates. According to a policy paper, Career Guidance: A Hand Book for Policy Makers by the Organisation For Economic Co-Operation And Development, the foundations of career self-management skills (like decision making, self-awareness, self-confidence) are laid at an early age.  However, career education and guidance in primary schools are limited or non-existent, and little systematic provision is made to explore the world of work. Young people need to make a smooth transition from primary school to the initial years of secondary education,  the paper partly reads. The paper highlights that some of the challenges are that career education and guidance are often considered to be the sole responsibility of the specialist career guidance staff rather than the joint responsibility of all members of the teaching staff. In conclusion, there needs to be policies and practice in place to encourage career guidance at lower levels of school and this should be a consorted effort of teachers, parents and the students themselves. How it is doneEarly start. Career development begins in childhood and includes the formal and informal experiences that give rise to talents, interests, values, and knowledge of the world of work, continues into adulthood via the progression of one s career behaviour such as entry into and adjustment to work throughout lifespan.Practice. While practising career guidance activities, school counsellors assist children and adolescents explore working environments and give information about working conditions and materials used during working.Visit workplaces. It is possible to promote career awareness among primary and secondary school children and adolescents by enabling them to visit workplaces and observing the types and process of jobs that workers do in workplaces. Mentorship. In addition to visiting work places, mentoring can enable children and adolescents to broaden their awareness about job tasks, attitudes, and supports needed to work successfully in any occupation. This way, children who live in rural areas with fewer opportunities may gain early awareness concerning certain specialised careers and can prepare themselves in primary and secondary school for entry into university regarding specialised careers.ResearchGate",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Have-career-conversations--at-an-early-stage-/688336-5122390-v2h2lr/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-20/post48.png
