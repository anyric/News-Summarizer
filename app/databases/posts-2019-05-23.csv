1,Populists looking to cause upsets as EU elections begin - Daily Monitor,"Populists are hoping to cause upsets across the EU as the European Parliament elections got under way on Thursday in polls that could challenge the Brussels consensus.Britain and the Netherlands kicked off four days of voting across the continent in a contest in which rising populist forces are hoping to make significant gains, threatening closer EU integration.Polls opened within half an hour of each other in the two countries early Thursday, with the first results not announced until late Sunday once voting in all 28 EU members has been completed. More than 400 million voters across the bloc are eligible to elect 751 MEPs -- with Britain unexpectedly included.Having voted to leave the EU in a seismic referendum in 2016, Britain was originally meant to depart on March 29 and therefore not take part in these elections.But its MPs have not been able to agree on a divorce deal and Britain now finds itself in the absurd situation of electing lawmakers to an institution it is planning to leave.The Brexit Party, formed only this year by eurosceptic figurehead Nigel Farage, is leading the latest British opinion polls by a solid margin.""We are attempting a peaceful political revolution in this country,"" he told the party's final rally on Tuesday.""The establishment: they're not frightened -- they're absolutely terrified!"" Farage said of his new party's rise.Opposed to closer EU integration In the Netherlands, flamboyant populist Thierry Baudet, a classics-quoting climate sceptic, is on course to beat Prime Minister Mark Rutte's Liberals.Once best known for naked Instagram selfies and controversial comments about women, Baudet, 36, stunned Europe in March when his Forum for Democracy became the biggest party in the Dutch senate.Around the continent, national leaders are scrambling to mobilise their supporters to resist the populist surge.These are the ninth European parliament elections since they began in 1979 and voter turnout has dropped each time, hitting 43 percent in 2014.European governments fear a good showing for eurosceptics will disrupt Brussels decision-making.Opinion polls predict a significant advance for nationalist and populist forces opposed to closer EU integration and threatening mainstream reform efforts.Everything has changedMatteo Salvini of Italy's anti-immigrant League and Marine Le Pen of France's far-right National Rally (RN) want their Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group to become the third largest in Brussels.Le Pen wants to strike a blow to Emmanuel Macron's faltering French presidency by overtaking his centrist, pro-European party Republic on the Move.Polls give the RN party a slight edge.""Everything has changed,"" she told AFP.""Before we were on our own on the European scene... we didn't have any allies. But in the space of a few months, a whole range of political forces have risen up in spectacular fashion,"" she said.Meanwhile in Britain, the rise of Farage is adding to the pressure for Prime Minister Theresa May to announce her resignation in the days to come over her failure to deliver Brexit on time.The British leader's woes were made worse Wednesday when her representative in parliament Andrea Leadsom quit, putting May's government under further strain.However, the strong showing by eurosceptics is not expected to sweep the whole bloc, with voters from Spain to Ireland and the former Soviet Baltic states showing solid backing for the EU.The latest Eurobarometer survey commissioned by the European Parliament found 61 percent of respondents calling their country's EU membership a good thing -- the highest level since the early 1990s.The polls will open on Friday in the Czech Republic and Ireland, and on Saturday in Latvia, Malta and Slovakia.But most countries will be voting on Sunday, with the results expected overnight into Monday.Centre-right set to win Nine different projections this month predict that the EPP, the main centre-right bloc in the assembly, will come out with the most seats ahead of the main centre-left PES bloc and then the ALDE liberals.Former Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker is stepping down after five years as president of the European Commission.EPP leader Manfred Weber is their candidate to replace him, while the PES is putting up former Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans.The hunt will also be on for someone to replace former Polish premier Donald Tusk as head of the EU leaders' council.Other prime jobs up for grabs will be those held by a trio of Italians: High Representative for foreign relations, Federica Mogherini, Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank and European Parliament speaker Antonio Tajani.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Populists-EU-elections-begin-Netherlands-Brussels/688340-5127850-mfqge5z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post1.png
2,"New cities raise great expectations in investments, revenue - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government will offer additional Shs57b to run the new cities to meet the new demands that come with creation of the cities. Documents from the local government ministry indicate that while the nine municipalities which have been elevated to cities have been receiving Shs111b, an additional Shs57b will be required to run their operations. The local government officials say once they start operations, the figures will rise to Shs168b. Government has already set aside Shs130b for the five cities that will start in 2020.The minister of Local Government, Col Tom Butime, said funds will be available for the cities to start operations. Government will provide funds for the cities to take off in an organised and planned manner. The cities will further be facilitated to attract both internal and external funding for garbage management, ICT improvement, tourism/leisure facilities and security,  Col Butime said.He said the elevations will make the new cities attractive destinations for investment and more investors will flock in.The minister said the cities were created for both strategic reasons and regional balancing. These range from industrial, tourism to mining. Under the strategic cities, Hoima, Jinja, Fort Portal and Entebbe were created. Others that are still under review and will be upgraded because of the same reasons are Nakasongola and Moroto.Arua, Mbale, Mbarara, Gulu and Lira will serve as the regional cities and will be joined by Masaka, Wakiso, Soroti and Kabale.Salaries Mr Justinian Niwagaba, the Commissioner for Urban Administration at the local government ministry, said salary structures for the new cities will not be above the current public service rates. He said like the district officials, the city and division officials fall under the same categories. The salary structures are the same like the rest of the public service staff. These cities were created under the Local Government Act and therefore they will earn the same salaries like their other colleagues in the civil service,  he said. On the issue of increased cost of business that may come as result of the elevations, Mr Niwagaba said there is no cause for worry. It s even better because more people will be attracted and this will bring down the cost of rent and taxes, so the worry about high costs should not be there,  he said.BoundariesA number of the cities have extended their boundaries, annexing some sub-counties from their mother districts, except Gulu city which has had its divisions merged to reduce the numbers from four to two. Ayivu County was added to make Arua Central Division and Ayivu Division. Jinja city will have Jinja South and Jinja North. The City will comprise the current Municipality and Bugembe town council, Mafubira and Budondo sub-counties that were annexed from Jinja District.Mbale Town has two divisions of Bungokho and Industrial Division. Bungokho Division comprises Northern Division, Nakaloke Town Council and the annexed neighbouring sub-counties of Bukonde, Nakaloke, Namabasa and Namanyonyi. Industrial Division has Bugema-Nauyo Town Council and Bukasakya and Bungokho-Mutoto sub-counties.In Fort Portal, sub-counties of Karambi, Bukuuku, Karago Town Council and Ibaale were added to the current municipal boundaries to form Fort Portal North Division, while in Mbarara, sub-counties of Biharwe, Kakiika and Nyakayojo were added to the municipality.How USMID programme elevated 9 municipalities to city statusThe World Bank-funded Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development (USMID) played a big role in preparing the nine municipalities to achieve city status, different municipality leaders say. The programme worked on roads, developed taxi parks and a number of other infrastructure that the municipalities initially did not have.Between 2013 and 2018, government spent $150m in 14 municipalities. Dilapidated and dusty roads that had never seen tarmac or had been in sorry state for several years finally received a facelift, giving the 14 municipalities a decent look, which aided their move towards city status.Under the programme, a total of 73 urban roads that make up 39.09kms were rehabilitated to asphalt concrete standards, with walkways, bicycle lanes in order to cater for all road users in the urban centre.The roads are also been fitted with solar lights to cater for safety and reduce on gender-based violence and crime that may crop up in the urban centres.Drainage structures and greening to manage the climate change related risks like heat waves and heavy floods.1320 trees and 56,449m of grass and flowers have been planted along the road reserves to enhance beautification of the same. Trash cans have also been provided to reduce on the littering of the streets.The 14 Municipal councils have been provided with specialised technical equipment in the area of engineering, physical planning, surveying and environment. The equipment include; Total stations, plotters, global positioning systems- GPS, computer and software (Arc GIS and Auto CAD), noise meter, water meter among others, all aimed at facilitating service delivery in the urban centre.Nine of these municipalities have since been elevated to city status, while others are under study with possibilities of elevation in the next three years.Mr Tom Buitme, the minister for Local Government, said the six municipalities of Masaka, Nakasongola, Moroto, Soroti, Kabale and Wakiso will be elevated to city status by 2023.He said the studies are showing positive trends for the municipalities and are expected to be completed by the end of next years, thereafter, a report will be made to the Cabinet for onward consideration.Ms Sheila Naturinda, the communications specialist at USMID, said the elevation of the nine municipalities to the city status is a testimony that they have done a commendable job in infrastructure development. USMID is proud to associate itself with the cities as created. The funding to these cities will remain the same and we are committed to ensuring that we accomplish our tasks,  Ms Naturinda said. Apart from roads, USMID supports investments in bus, taxi and lorry parks, beautification of streets, markets, drainages, street lighting, development of solid waste management strategies, procurement of specialized equipment for environment, physical planning, surveying and engineering,  she added.She said under the next phase, more roads will be upgraded with the accompanying infrastructure. What Jinja leaders sayJinja Municipality Mayor, Majid Batambuze.  We are planning to elevate Kimaka Airport to an international standard, rehabilitate Rippon Port, which will connect to Mwanza in Tanzania, a transport terminal for both taxis and buses and an Industrial park in Mutai Village in Kakira Town Council. We have already started beautifying the city, we have put the road names to all the streets, and we are lighting up the city.Abdallah Zein, Jinja Central Division Speaker. The rehabilitation of roads such as Main Street, Clive Road West under USMID have also greatly changed the image of our new city. Jinja being an old municipality, is well planned with municipality headquarters that will be turned into a city headquarters.Henry Kyembe, former Jinja West Municipality MP. We have been waiting for Jinja for many years to be elevated to a city status, it is long overdue, I am happy at last and I hope it will boost tourism and industrial sector.Reactions from AruaBernard Atiku, MP Ayivu County. As the city is endorsed, it comes with a demand for an international airport, for Arua s case, you do not need to emphasise this. Even with all the efforts we have done to convince the locals to move away and get compensated for the airport because we planned this for a city. The work is just too slow to believe. If Amin was here, Arua would have received an International Airport. Christine Asibazuyo, a resident of Arua Municipality. While this is a dream come true, we cannot have a City with intermittent power supply. We need strong and steady power that can facilitate industries.Issa Kato, Mayor Arua Municipality. We are prepared for the city because we already have roads within that have been done. Not only that the Muni University, the taxi park and market. And once we expand the territory of the municipality, we shall have increased revenue because currently we get inadequate tax from the two the divisions. And we shall ensure that the city is made clean with improved revenue. Comments from Fort portalChris Amanyire, Butebe chairperson. Regional cities are not like the capital city. The capital city is a business hub but a regional city is created for a specific purpose.Christine Kanyunyuzi, a businesswoman. Every development comes with challenges, especially to us who have small businesses. Taxes are going to increase to suit city standards and some of us will leave business because of taxes. Fort Portal Municipality MP Alex Ruhunda. I have been sensitising the masses about the city and so this will continue until it is operational. The rest will be done by technical experts in implementing the new direction.From Mbale Mutwalibi Mafabi Zandya, Mayor of Mbale municipality. We welcome the decision and we are happy because we have been waiting for it for long but finally, we have got it. The town is ready because the road network is perfect. We have installed security and traffic lights and have the required population and all other requirements are in place.Mr John Musila, a resident. There are going to be a lot of job opportunities for our youth in different fields more so in police and civil service.What Mbarara saysBright Muhumuza, politician. For me, the city is intended to serve political interests of the ruling party and solve political questions in the area. It is for political not economic reasons. I support it only when it s for economic reasons, when it s going to benefit everyone not the politicians  interests.Vincent Kyamadidi, Resident of Kakiika Division. Personally I have no problem with urbanisation if it s well planned. But if it s unplanned, like we are doing it now, it s dangerous. You will impose burden on the people because they are not prepared. It should be from down to up so that people are well prepared, not from up as it is now. Imam Shaffi Kagiko, councilor, Katete Ward. The leadership we have has not done well with resources we have been having. We need better leaders we expect to have polished leaders as a city. The leaders we have I don t see them ready to receive the city. They are accustomed to corruption and misappropriation of public resources, now that we will have bigger budget, it will worsen.By Franklin Draku, Felix Warom Okello, Alfred Tumushabe, Tausi Nakato, Fred Wambede & Scovia Atuhaire.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/New-cities-raise-great-expectations-investments-revenue/688334-5127596-jr3o5t/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post2.png
3,Traders resort to smuggling as Rwanda border remains closed - Daily Monitor,"KABALE. As the Rwandan border with Uganda at Katuna and Cyanika remain closed for three months now, traders from either side have resorted to smuggling.Local residents and traders told this newspaper yesterday that smuggling is risky but highly rewarding with abnormal profits if one beats the Rwandan security forces to the game.Mr Enock Kazooba, the chairman of Ryakarikira Town Council in Kabale District, which borders with Rwanda, said during night hours, Rwandan nationals smuggle beans, peas and some manufactured goods to Uganda through ungazetted border points, where waiting Ugandan traders pay them cash.Why smuggle They have resorted to this illegal trade to raise money for funding their daily needs. Ever since the Rwandan border was closed, many Rwandan nationals have entered Uganda and are staying in different communities in the sub-counties near the border,  Mr Kazooba said.On February 27, Rwandan authorities closed their border with Uganda at Katuna, accusing Uganda of torturing its citizens and immediately stopped them from crossing into Uganda. Uganda denies the claim. Last month, a Rwandan businessman, Mr Innocent Mr Ndahimana, a resident of Nyakabungo Village, Chumba Sub-county in Gicumbi District in Rwanda was allegedly shot by Rwandan security operatives as he tried to smuggle about 500kg of beans into Uganda during evening hours. He was rushed by his colleagues to Katuna Community Medical Clinic on the Ugandan side for treatment.A businessman in Katuna Town Council said he and his colleagues have resorted to smuggling because the risky trade is lucrative. We buy beans that Rwandans smuggle to Uganda at Shs2,000 per kilo and sell at Shs2,400 per kilo. As Rwandans return to their homes, they buy posho [maize floor], matooke, potatoes, raw tobacco and cassava, among others, from us,  Mr Twesigye said.The officer-in-charge of Uganda Revenue Authority enforcement at the border, Mr Patrick Esabu, warned traders against smuggling, saying anybody caught in the act would be prosecuted.Businesses collapseThe chairman of the traders association at Katuna Town Council, Mr Franko Korinako, said business in Katuna Town has collapsed and many shops and hotels closed for lack of customers. There used to be about 40 guest houses in Katuna serving hundreds of traders that crossed the Katuna border every day but since the border was closed, more than 35 of them have closed for lack of customers,  Mr Korinako said.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Traders-resort-to-smuggling-as-Rwanda-border-remains-closed/688334-5127562-cxbraez/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post3.png
4,"Regional security body broke, can t track rebels - Daily Monitor","Kampala. The regional security body tasked to carry out surveillance on armed conflicts in the Great Lakes region is running broke. It said this has hampered their capacity to do intelligence work on subversive groups such as the Allied Democratic Forces rebels and ISIS who are destabilising the region. The International Conference of the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) yesterday warned that if its Secretariat, which has been coordinating intelligence sharing on different rebel groups such as ADF is closed, the region may plunge into a security crisis. The ICGLR executive secretary, Mr Zachary Muburi-Muita, blamed the crisis on member states who have not paid their contributions. We are experiencing financial problems. If the Secretariat is closed, I should not be blamed because the member states have not met their obligations. The staff have gone without pay for five months,  he said during a regional security meeting of intelligence chiefs from the member states at the Commonwealth Resort Munyonyo. Mr Muita did not say how much money has not been remitted by the defaulting member states but told the intelligence and security chiefs from the bloc currently meeting in Munyonyo, Kampala, that out of the 12 member states, only Uganda and Kenya have fully paid their subscription fees. He made a passionate appeal to the heads of state to intervene and have their countries pay the annual mandatory subscription fees to the security body. The countries that have not paid are Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, Angola, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Sudan, DR Congo and Congo Brazzaville.Mr Muita said, without specifying how much each country pays, that the subscription fees vary according to the size of the economy of each country.  Angola pays the highest amount and countries with smaller economies pay less,  he said. The ICGLR has been coordinating repatriation of ex-combatants such as the Congolese M23 from Uganda, Rwandan FDRL and mobilising member states to share intelligence on rebel groups like the Ugandan rebels of Allied Democratic Forces operating in eastern DR Congo. If we don t maintain the Secretariat, these groups may find a fertile ground for survival,  Mr Muita told the spy chiefs, who are discussing infiltration of the Islamic State agents in DR Congo and the threats posed by ADF and Ebola epidemic in the same country.The intelligence chiefs are meeting under the Regional Coordination Committee of ICGLR Directors General and Chiefs of Intelligence and Security Services that met in Congo Brazzaville. The Uganda s Director General of External Security Organisation, Mr Joseph Ocwet, said despite regional security threats, 67 M23 rebels have been repatriated to DR Congo and FDRL ex-fighters taken back to Rwanda. The Uganda s Chief of Defence Forces, Gen David Muhoozi, who was the chief guest said, the region needs  enhanced cooperation  between intelligence chiefs to fight cross-border crime such as drug trafficking and negatives forces like ISIS.

5,"We have other priorities, government tells striking teachers - Daily Monitor","Kampala. The hopes of striking teachers to get salary increment were yesterday cast down after government told them it has bigger priorities to address other than enhancing salaries.In a letter to all Public Service labour unions, Mr David Karubanga, the State minister for Public Service, said government s priorities are completing oil infrastructure, power stations, projects to address youth empowerment and employment, defence and security, revival of Uganda Airlines and construction of irrigation schemes to address climate change.Although Mr Karubanga said government was committed to implementing the five-year pay target Cabinet approved last year, only Shs62.89 billion was provided for the second phase of which 13.8 billion will be for the health sector while Shs49 billion is for education. The second phase which was supposed to be financed in the Financial Year 2019/20 has been deliberated on alongside the other competing critical government priorities. Ensure workers under your jurisdiction continue to provide services as required of them,  Mr Karubanga wrote. Mr Filbert Baguma, the Uganda National Teachers  Union (Unatu) general secretary, yesterday cast doubt on government s commitment insisting they will continue with the strike as the letter does not address their grievances.  We shall continue the strike until government fulfils what we agreed on. There is nothing committal in that letter. It doesn t address any issue about the collective bargaining agreement. Even when they say Shs49 billion is for education, what is it going to do and how  The letter itself doesn t have anything convincing. There is no substance in this letter. Our teachers should remain firm as we continue with the struggle,  Mr Baguma said after receiving the letter from Mr Karubanga, dated May 21.The teachers started their industrial action on Monday a week to the opening of second term. Earlier in the day yesterday, the Workers Members of Parliament weighed in to support the teachers  cause to push for their salary enhancement.Ms Margaret Rwabushaija, a Workers MP said:  There are procedures spelt out in the Constitution for an aggrieved public servant to follow. The teachers negotiated with government and they agreed. They gave notice and government didn t respond. Government should honour their pledge. We support the teachers  strike. Ministry of Education Permanent Secretary, Mr Alex Kakooza, explained that the Shs49 billion will be used to harmonise the disparities which were created after government paid the first phase of salary increment. In a separate letter of May 17 from Ministry of Finance s Mr Patrick Ocailap to Ministry of Education, asked Mr Kakooza to provide him with a breakdown of the wage for administrative science cadres in health and education left out in the first phase of pay enhancement for scientists in FY2019/20. Reference is made to my letter of May 7, requesting you to provide a detailed allocation of Shs49 billion that was provided to address the salary disparities in your sector. Despite a follow up and constant reminders, you have failed to submit the detailed schedule for allocation of the wage enhancement to enable finalisation of corrigenda. We are left with no choice but to exclude the detailed allocation from corrigenda which has been submitted to Parliament,  Mr Ocailap noted.However, Mr Kakooza yesterday said they had sent the schedule although they had to first verify with each affected individual from the various institutions across the country.

8,Nine injured as UPDF soldiers beat up residents in Luweero - Daily Monitor,"At least nine civilians and two UPDF soldiers have been injured in clashes between the soldiers and civilians at Mabuye village in Luweero District.It is reported that the clashes started after a group residents mistook UPDF soldiers to be cattle thieves and attacked them with pangas and other rudimentary weapons.The soldiers attached to Nakasongola Army Barracks were reportedly on military training in the village hills.The civilians who were beaten up by the soldiers are Mr Steven Kuteesa, the Mabuye Village Local Council  1 Chairperson, Mr Allan Jjumba, Mr Francois Makobero, Mr Vincent Mukumbya, Mr Steven Kiraga, Mr Brian Ssemujju, Mr Muhamadi Masolo, Mr Ronald Kamoga and Mr Steven Katuluba.The two UPDF soldiers who allegedly sustained injuries in the fight and are reportedly receiving treatment at Nakasongola Military Hospital, were not readily identified.Mr Kuteesa said he received a call from one of the residents informing him that some armed men were loitering in the village at midnight and could be plotting to steal their cattle.This, he said, prompted him to mobilise residents who started a hunt for the strangers.However, to their shock, the strangers turned out to be heavily-armed UPDF soldiers.The soldiers reportedly disarmed and undressed the residents before embarking on beating and torturing them.Mr Kuteesa said their pleas for clemency fell on deaf ears.Mr Katuluba, one of the residents who tested the wrath of the soldiers said he sustained injuries on the chest and the head.It s not clear how the two soldiers who are reportedly admitted to Nakasongola Military Hospital, got the injuries.Mr Edward Ssenyonyi, the Kamira Sub-county chairman criticised the soldiers for conducting military training in the villages without notifying local leaders.He asked UPDF to transfer the injured civilians to hospital.Neither Luweeero District Police Commander, Ms Rebecca Ayeta nor Savannah Regional Police Spokesman, Mr Bosco Otim, were willing to comment on the incident since they were not aware of any military training in the area.Maj Isaac Oware, the spokesperson of Nakasongola Army Barracks confirmed the incident saying the soldiers acted in self-defence after being attacked by the residents.Maj Oware said that local leaders were notified about the training and this is a normal procedure but the residents only preferred to provoke the soldiers.He advised the injured civilians to seek private medical attention because the army cannot meet medical bills of people  who provoked them.He, however, said police and UPDF officers are investigating the matter.

9,Panasonic joins firms stepping away from Huawei after US ban - Daily Monitor,"Japan's Panasonic on Thursday said it would stop supplying some components to Huawei, joining a growing list of firms distancing themselves from the Chinese telecoms giant after a US ban over security concerns.The announcement came a day after four major Japanese and British mobile carriers said they would delay releasing new Huawei handsets.""We've stopped all business transactions with Huawei and its 68 group companies... that are subject to the US government ban,"" Panasonic spokesman Joe Flynn told AFP.""Yesterday an internal instruction to fully enforce that rule was issued,"" he added.Flynn said Panasonic's business with Huawei includes the supply of ""electronic parts,"" but declined to provide further details.Washington's restrictions affect products made fully or partially in the United States, where Panasonic manufactures some of the components it supplies to Huawei, the Japanese firm said.A Panasonic official declined to comment on what business the Japanese firm would continue to do with Huawei, though reports said the suspension would have a limited impact.Last week, US President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to bar US companies from using foreign telecoms equipment deemed a security risk.The move appeared aimed at Huawei, though the White House said no particular company or country was targeted.It has prompted a parade of firms to step back from dealings with Huawei, including US internet giant Google, whose Android operating system powers most of the world's smartphones.And on Wednesday mobile carriers in Japan and Britain said they were delaying releases of Huawei handsets. Temporary suspensionsTelecoms giant EE, owned by BT, was due to bring Huawei's first 5G phone, the Huawei Mate 20X, to Britain, but the Chinese giant's involvement in the country's telecoms sector has become politically controversial.EE chief executive Marc Allera said the company had ""paused"" the launch of Huawei's 5G phones ""until we get the information and confidence and the long-term security that our customers... are going to be supported"".The group also said it would phase out the use of Huawei equipment in the most sensitive ""core"" elements of its network infrastructure.Vodafone soon followed suit, announcing a ""temporary"" suspension of pre-orders for Huawei handsets, ""while uncertainty exists"".The BBC also reported that British firm ARM, which designs processors used in most mobile devices and makes products that contain ""US-origin technology,"" is set to cut ties with HuaweiARM staff were told to suspend ""all active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagements"" with Huawei, according to internal documents seen by the BBC. Huawei said Wednesday that it recognised ""the pressure"" placed on its suppliers, and that it was ""confident this regrettable situation can be resolved."" A sense of safetyIn Japan, KDDI and SoftBank Corp, the country's number-two and number-three carriers respectively, said they too were delaying the release of Huawei handsets to assess the impact of the US ban.""We are currently trying to confirm if our customers will be able to use the equipment with a sense of safety"", SoftBank spokesman Hiroyuki Mizukami told AFP.And the country's biggest carrier, NTT Docomo, said it was suspending pre-orders for a new Huawei handset, but stopped short of halting the release.Trump's order effectively bans US companies from selling Huawei and affiliates the critical components that have helped it grow into the world's largest supplier of telecom networking equipment and second-biggest smartphone maker.US officials this week, however, issued a 90-day stay on the ban, saying breathing space is needed to avoid huge disruption.The US Commerce Department has also announced an effective ban on US companies selling or transferring US technology to Huawei.Analysts say the restrictions could be seriously damaging for the Chinese firm, with the pullback by Google and ARM likely to be ""particularly troubling"" for the telecoms giant.""How the US ban on business with Huawei will impact the Chinese firm's performance is at this point unclear, but what is clear to me is that its sales will be negatively affected,"" said Hiroyuki Kubota, an independent financial analyst.Washington has long suspected deep links between Huawei and the Chinese military, and its moves against the company come amid the churning trade dispute between the world's top two economies.The issue has also been the source of heated controversy in Britain ever since a leak from the country's National Security Council last month suggested the government was planning a limited role for Huawei in its 5G network.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Britain during a visit to London that it risked undermining the historic allies' intelligence sharing.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Panasonic-firms-Huawei-US-ban-Donald-Trump-China/688340-5127666-yf5xkt/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post9.png
10,Motorists suffer traffic jams as city flyover works commence - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Motorists should for the next one month brace themselves for traffic congestion in the city as construction of a multi-billion Kampala flyover project kicks off.A joint statement issued by Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), Kampala Capital City Authority, and the contractor yesterday indicates that traffic on Nsambya Road, Queen s Way, Clock Tower and Shoprite junction will be diverted.Unra officials explained that the purpose of the diversion of traffic is to allow the contractor of the project, NIPPON KOE Co Ltd and its partners, undertake  Geotechnical investigation works  on selected sections of the project area from May 15 to June 12.However, Unra clarified in a statement that the diversion does not mean total road closure but rather diverting traffic to the left lane instead of the current two lanes being used. This means that the traffic, including boda bodas, shall largely share the single lane.DiversionDuring the 10-day period, Kampala-bound traffic (Nsambya to Kampala) shall use the lane on the extreme left. This will be the same for Nsambya- bound (Kampala to Nsambya/Kibuli where motorists will use the lane on the left.Similarly, Entebbe-bound traffic (Kampala to Entebbe) shall also use the lane on the extreme left.However, the 10-day diversion of traffic is likely to cause traffic gridlock since the affected areas are strategic to the city centre and are used by many motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.For instance, traffic on Entebbe Road, which is the second busiest road in the city, is likely to be paralysed. Shoprite too is likely to experience a traffic gridlock. But when Daily Monitor visited the affected areas, motorists heading from Ggaba through Kansanga to the city centre were diverted at Kabalagala junction to Ggaba Road and onto Mbogo Road up to the 8th Street. Then, from Daily Monitor junction on 8th Street, the vehicles would join the Mukwano roundabout and then proceed to Jinja Road.For motorists heading to Entebbe, they were diverted at Clock Tower and then exit the city through Kafumbe Mukasa Road up to Usafi Market. Some would also branch off to Mengo Hill Road through Lubiri Ring Road until they reach Kibuye roundabout.Motorists respondSome of the motorists yesterday expressed concern about the heavy traffic jams that is likely to occcur. It is really tough for us operators of commercial vehicles because the more trips we make the more money we get but with this diversion, our daily earnings are definitely going to drastically reduce,  said Asuman Ssebunya, a taxi driver who plys the Kampala-Ggaba route.Traffic police spokesperson Charles Ssembabulidde could not be reached when we attempted to find out how they intend to control traffic on the affected areas.Daily Monitor reported last week that preliminary works on the Kampala flyover Construction and Road Upgrading Project had been commenced.Project design The project design indicates that Clock Tower flyover will be half a kilometre long. The road from Shoprite at Queens s Way towards Katwe will be widened to have more lanes. The contractors, according to the plan, will also improve Nsambya Road, Mukwano Road and part of Ggaba Road. The second phase of the flyover will be on Jinja Road near Centenary Park and Wampewo Roundabout.  The two flyovers are expected to connect outwards to the proposed Kampala-Jinja and Kampala Expressways. The flyover project is being funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency at a tune of Shs224b and is implemented by Unra on behalf of government of Uganda. It is expected to be completed within three years.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Motorists-suffer-traffic-jams-city-flyover-works-commence/688334-5127422-j9r556z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post10.png
11,Namboole land: ULC subdivided land into five plots - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Mandela National Stadium Namboole s 120 acres of land were subdivided into five plots, the committee investigating land matters was told on Tuesday. The acting commissioner of surveys and mapping, Mr Wilson Ogalo Ebunyu, while testifying before the land probe, said the land was subdivided by Uganda Land Commission (ULC).  Plot 3,391 was subdivided into Plot 6,086 (12.641 hectares) that was given to Pioneer Easy Bus Ltd and created a residual of Plot 6,087 (34.89 hectares). Plot 6,087 was also subdivided into plots 6,152, 6,153 and 6,154 that are registered by Uganda Land Commission,  Mr Ogalo testified. When asked by the commission s deputy Lead Counsel, Mr John Bosco Suuza, why Namboole stadium land had been subdivided, Mr Ogalo said he did not know. The management of Mandela National Stadium last week petitioned the commission to compel UCL to give them a land title. The managing director, Mr Jamil Ssewanyana, also wants the land probe to help them get rid of encroachers. The stadium management plans to build an Olympic-size swimming pool and a gymnasium to promote sports.The acting secretary of UCL, Mr Robert Nyombi, testified before the land probe on the giveaway of Namboole stadium land but had a difficult time explaining how the UCL created Plot 6,086 measuring 31 acres and gave it to Pioneer Easy Bus Ltd. The bus company that has a five-year lease on the land. The meeting that confirmed the minutes that gave away the land was my first meeting at the commission,  Mr Nyombi said, defending himself against any wrongdoing in the give-away. He said this was the work of the commission s board.Mr Nyombi reasoned that though the lease was inconsistent with the user, transportation was an auxiliary service to the stadium. When pressed hard on the giveaway, Mr Nyombi later said he was in a situation where he could not comment about certain things and he asked to speak to the land probe in camera.  The 66 land titles that government received in Namboole were not cancelled and amalgamated and that is why we are having all these problems,  Mr Nyombi said.The acting secretary said the two families of Ms Norah Nabagesera and Thomas Bazitya had been paid and they surrendered their original titles to government as a pre-condition for the payment.  That is why they have special titles and none of them has an original title,  Mr Nyombi said. Ms Nabagesera and the late James Nsubuga Kitakka are joint administrators of the estate of the late Crespo Kitakka.Mr Nyombi pledged to follow up and ensure the special titles issued on the land are cancelled.The land probe team was surprised to learn that though the land had been amalgamated, the same was not reflected on the cadastral maps (show land use) in the department of survey and mapping. The Wakiso District staff surveyor, Dr Joseph Batume, who also appeared before Justice Bamugemereire, promised to work with the commissioner of land registration in the Ministry of Lands to have the amalgamated land reflected on the cadastral maps at Wakiso. The Land probe is continuing with investigations into encroachment on land at Namboole.1965 AGREEMENTPurchase of land. Government purchased 120 acres of land from individuals at Namboole to construct a stadium, which was part of a 1965 bilateral agreement where China pledged to build a rice scheme in Kibimba and an ice plant in Bugolobi. The stadium is currently utilising 60 acreas while another 60 acres are in the hands of encroachers.

12,Africa's dilemma in the face of imminent global shocks - Daily Monitor,"The future is no longer is as predictable as it used to be. Weather and climate change trends pose huge challenges. Principles of democracy are being put to test in the very nations that birthed and emphasized the same principles over the years. Even academic concepts such as the law of demand and supply are being stretched in the face of increasing reliance on software driven production and supply channels. The need to employ a futuristic approach to managing all human occupations needs no emphasis in view of such uncertainty. Globally, the future promises to be laden with disconcerting surprises. The World Economic Forum produces an annual global risks report which is a good log of evolving trends in the shocks that prevail in our times. Their 2018 edition highlights developments that should interest Africa. Among other global threats, it highlights that political commitment to globalization has since weakened in the wake of the global financial crisis and this threatens global trade as a result of bilateral trade wars that can easily cascade. Today, there are deeper protectionist tendencies all over the world. The global trade system is threatened.Africa being the poorest continent must quickly devise means to address the danger arising from this and The African Continental Free Trade Area initiative being pursued currently is an excellent step in the right direction. Unfortunately though, there appears to be lack of appreciation of the urgency required to consolidate this initiative. By mid-May 2019, out of 55 countries, 3 had not signed the relevant agreement at all whereas only 20 countries had proceeded to ratify it after signing. Nigeria, the largest economy on the continent, is among the 3 countries that had not signed it, along with Eritrea and Benin. Protectionism is rife on the continent, the prevailing poverty and trailing position of the continent on the global wealth scale notwithstanding. African countries seem not to realize that their dismal economies have nothing to benefit from continuing to play in isolation, or that indeed even the biggest amongst them are endangered. Our isolated economies are too weak to wield any favorable influence for themselves on the international stage and will continue to be taken advantage of, in a global market space that is turning into a jungle.Equally important is the revelation that the world faces danger of simultaneous failure of breadbaskets facilitated by disruptors such as extreme weather, political instability or crop diseases. All these disrupting factors are prominent for Africa. For example, the continent is almost entirely unprepared for extreme weather events. According to FAO, only an average 7% of arable land in Africa was under irrigation by 2015, with the scale for Sub-Saharan Africa tipping to an even a smaller 4%. The rest of the continent s farming activity runs on rain fed agriculture. Civil strife is also a common occurrence, and in many instances political conflicts have matured into prolonged wars as have been seen in Somalia, South Sudan, the Lake Chad Basin, DRC and Central African Republic, the Horn of Africa and Mali. Such conflicts can cripple food production. In foresight, continental leaders have taken steps to strengthen the food production chain, although again the intended measures to attain this have not been implemented. In 2003, African countries agreed under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme to allocate at least 10 percent of public budgets to agriculture in order to achieve 6% growth in the sector. By 2010,seven years later, Sub-Saharan Africa was allocating only 3% of total expenditures on agriculture on average, and the entire continent was doing slightly better at 3.9%. With the highest population growth rate in the world and the related food need, this is a dire situation for Africa.It is unfortunate that even when obvious dangers have been identified and solutions devised, the continent procrastinates along the solutions paths. We are positioning our descendants for peril.Prominent also among other global dangers is the increasing tendency towards war without rules manifesting especially in form of cyber-attacks, even between super powers. The growing disregard for conventional war, with agreed norms and protocols, should concern Africa because it is an indicator of potential reckless attacks by super powers of weaker nations in future, even in form of physical aggression. Africa in the current state, of isolated countries, is too weak to protect itself from such trends. Perhaps the continent should be considering unity beyond trade as well.The writer is a Chartered Risk Analyst and risk management consultant[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Africa-dilemma-global-shocks-supply-channels-Nigeria/688334-5125068-xrgs5e/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post12.png
13,"Thieves use South Sudan number plates to steal cars, police say - Daily Monitor","SOROTI. Police have revealed that thieves are using South Sudan number plates to steal Ugandan vehicles to feed the Kenya black market.Mr Michael Odongo, the regional police spokesperson for East Kyoga, said thieves have taken advantage of the roaming vehicles from South Sudan to disguise stolen Ugandan cars with fake South Sudan number plates that they sell to Kenya. He said a resident of Mbale was arrested on the Tororo-Busia highway on his way to Kenya on Tuesday morning, with a vehicle stolen from Soroti the night before. When thieves steal cars from Uganda, they replace the number plates with those of South Sudan before they set off to Kenya,  he explained. We have decided to start impounding all vehicles bearing South Sudan number plates for verification, because we have realised that most of those vehicles are stolen from Ugandan citizens,  Mr Odongo said.He said such trickery has been making their operations difficult.Mr Odongo said this following the fresh incidents of car theft in Soroti where three cases have been registered in only one week.He said the car that was stolen that night belonged to Mr David Omeke, a resident of Nakatunya Ward, Western Division in Soroti Municipality. This vehicle was stolen at Mr Omeke s of residence in Nakatunya before it was intercepted on Tuesday morning in Tororo,  he said. One of the officers working with The Flying Squad department in East Kyoga said a premio in a good mechanical condition is sold in the Kenyan black market at Shs1.5 million and a Subaru at Shs4 million only.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Thieves-use-South-Sudan-number-plates-steal-cars-police/688334-5127302-gl4pbl/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post17.png
14,Institution to build 8 hospitals in West Nile - Daily Monitor,"West Nile. Rhema Hospital, a private institution in West Nile, has secured more than Shs317 billion from Agape Sanctuary Ministries International to construct eight modern hospitals across the sub-region.The health institution will construct hospitals in Arua, Pakwach Nebbi, Zombo, Koboko, Yumbe, Moyo and Adjumani districts.  We are not building this for today but for years to come with state-of-art equipment ranging from diagnostic imaging, Computerised tomography (CT) scan, X-ray, ultrasound, renal and kidney unit, intensive care unit, IVF Laboratory,  Dr Ronald Debo, the hospital director, said yesterday. When you are critically ill in this region, you are left to die or it is God to save you. But we want to reverse this trend,  he added.Dr Debo said the hospitals are expected to employ more than 400 health workers.He said the costs of surgery will be affordable, adding that they will be determined when the construction is complete.  People who are referred to Mulago hospital usually die either in Karuma, Nakasongola because of the long distance. We shall have tele medicines because there will be specialists in the hospital. The Orthopaedic services will help us save people from dying from accidents,  he said. The hospital will also expand services to neighbouring DR Congo and South Sudan. The donors said the health facilities, expected to be constructed within two years, is part of their mission.  We believe that people should not only go to church every Sunday, but we should also be responsible for the welfare of people who need to eat, need treatment. We have a mission to construct five referral hospitals in this country. And this is the beginning,  Bishop Daniel Mwanga of Agape Sanctuary Ministries in Africa, said. There are many medical facilities across this country but they have limitations. We need to have the modern equipment and human resource that will be able to treat patients although, we have been struggling with money to be cleared by the government,  he added.The State Minister of Finance, General Duties, Mr Gabriel Ajedra, said the project will supplement government efforts in providing health services.  We (Ministry of Finance) have been struggling to fund government hospitals and health centres, but this will now decongest the regional hospitals also,  Mr Ajedra, who is also the Vuura County MP, said.Responding to the question about blocking the construction funds, Mr Ajedra said:  Management needs to have investment licence for this project because with minimum of $5m (Shs18b), we (Finance) directed that URA (Uganda Revenue Authority) waives taxes in certain areas. This will further reduce cost of construction and hospital equipment that will be imported. I will follow this issue of blockage of the money personally this week since the business plan is already there. Mr Bernard Atiku, the MP for Ayivu County, promised support to Rhema because it has transformed many lives and passed the test of being a hospital. We will be together in this journey as local leaders. This is not only for the Ayivu people but for a greater north, South Sudan and Congo. One cannot underrate this kind of development,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Institution-build-8-hospitals-West-Nile/688334-5127260-131m4c2/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post18.png
15,Government spends Shs44b on Karamoja elderly - Daily Monitor,"Karamoja. Government has so far spent Shs44 billion to pay 27,110 senior citizens under its Social Assistance Grants for Empowerment (SAGE) in Karamoja Sub-region since the programme s initiation in 2010. Mr Joseph Basoga, the programme s communications officer, told Daily Monitor recently that government will commit another Shs59b in the next financial year to cover the country. Already, Parliament has passed unanimous recommendations that beginning next year, SAGE should roll out in the whole country covering all elderly persons of 80 years and above,  he said.Mr Basoga, however, said the recommendations will not affect those already on the programme.Government has also increased the age for the beneficiaries from the current 65 years to 80. Each elderly person receives Shs25,000 monthly. Mr Joseph Lomonyang, the Napak District chairperson, said the grant has improved the lives of the elderly in the sub-region. We are very happy with government for this grant because most elders, who were at the verge of dying due to lack of basic needs, have become strong,  he said.Mr Francis Kiyonga, the Amudat District chairperson, appealed to government to increase the pay. We appreciate what government pays the senior citizens, but it is little. My appeal is that let this money be increased so that these beneficiaries can invest wisely,  he said. Ms Betty Nangiro, a resident of Kotido District, said the proceeds have enabled her start an income-generating project and even save.

16,Gulu Archdiocese short of funds as Martyrs Day  nears - Daily Monitor,"Gulu. With only one week to the Uganda Martyrs Day celebrations at Namugongo Martyrs shrine, the Gulu Archdiocese says they are short of the required funds needed to carry out activities for the day.Gulu Archdiocese was selected by the Uganda Episcopal Conference to animate this year s June 3 celebrations under the theme:  Obey God Always and Everywhere. The archdiocese on behalf of the Gulu Ecclesiastical Province that consists of Gulu, Lira, Arua and Nebbi affiliate dioceses had budgeted to raise Shs900 million.However, the central organising committee chairperson, Mr Lawrence Komakech, said they have only been able to raise half of what was budgeted. He said most of the pledges made by individuals, business entities and corporate companies, have not been fulfilled. The struggle to raise funds is still ongoing. Most of our money is in pledges, and they have not been fulfilled. We encourage those who made pledges to fulfil their commitment because the finances are needed now and not after the celebrations,  Mr Komakech told Daily Monitor in an interview yesterday.  If these pledges are not met, it will be a big setback for us. The pledges are in line with our budget and we need it more than ever before,  he added.He said the money is meant to organise liturgy, purchasing uniforms for the choir, hiring public address systems, security, transport and food for the pilgrims, among others.Yesterday, the dfcu regional manager - northern, Mr Christopher Kinyera, handed Shs15 million to Gulu Archdiocese Bishop John Baptist Odama as part of the pledge they made for the Archdiocese towards the celebrations. Dfcu bank is proud to join Gulu Archdiocese on this noble cause to celebrate the Martyrs  Day. We felt we have to be part of this team and on behalf of the bank, we shall give Shs15 million,  Mr Kinyera said.A total of 240 pilgrims from Gulu Archdiocese set off last week to Namugongo Martyrs shrine to prepare for this year s celebrations.

17,Completion of Shs380b Tourism Hotel delayed - Daily Monitor,"Jinja.  Completion of the $102.5m (Shs382b) three-star hotel at the Uganda Hotel and Tourism Training Institute (UHTTI) in Jinja District, earlier set for April 10, has been deferred to September.On April 10, 2018, the Minister for Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities, Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, led a team of government officials and other partners on a ground-breaking ceremony to kick-start construction of the hotel, which was supposed to be completed within 12 months.FundingThe facility is co-funded by the World Bank ($100m or about Shs373b) and Ugandan Government ($2.5m or about Shs9b). Construction is being undertaken by Roko Construction Limited, supervised by Arch Design Limited, whereas Competitiveness and Enterprise Development Project (CEDP) are the borrower s representatives.The CEDP project coordinator, Dr John-Marie Kyewalabye, in a telephone interview with this newspaper on Wednesday, said completion of the facility is behind schedule because of the two months they lost before the actual works commenced. When a contractor gets to a site, there are things he must comply with, which are mandatory like environmental social safeguards, which are sanctioned by the National Environment Management Authority.Other issues Also, the contractor has to mobilise people and equipment; all this is part of what happens in the cycle. Then, some redesigns were undertaken, which needed time to be approved and there was need to undertake a review of boundaries for the hotel land,  he explained.He added:  We are on course, the superstructure is done, completion works are at 60 per cent and we are currently doing fittings such as electricity, the lifts and water, hoping that landscaping will be done during this period. According to Dr Kyewalabye, they are not merely delivering a building, but also furnishings with cutlery.Since UHTTI is the only government institution which specialises in hotel and hospitality, government deemed it prudent to develop the facility so as to improve the quality of the staff.Ms Miriam Namutosi, the institute s principal, said the delay has affected their operations because the current intake, which started on April 8, was planned in such a way that by the time students report, they would find the training kitchens and training restaurants in place. This delay forced us to find other contingency measures as we wait for the facility to be completed in September,  she said.Ms Namutosi also lamented the other challenges the institute is grappling with, for example the lack of cars for conducting driving lessons. She said the institution has only one car for practical driving lessons, which is also very old and in poor mechanical condition.  Currently, we are hiring external or commercial driving schools to help with practical driving lessons,  she said.The facility, once completed, will comprise a 50-room hotel block, a 321-seater conference hall, 100-seater bar and coffee terrace, two student demonstration kitchens, training restaurants and a laundry block to provide the hospitality students with hands-on experience on modern facilities.Student enrolmentAccording to Ms Namutosi, after completion of the project, student enrolment is expected to eclipse the current enrolment capacity of 450 students and grow to about 680 students for both residents and non-residents. To be in tandem with international standards, a national curriculum has been designed and approved by the Uganda National Council for Higher Education and is ready to be rolled out,  Ms Namutosi said.She added that there is a Technical Advisor hired to advise government on how to turn the institute into a modern hotel training hub.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Completion-Shs380b-Tourism-Hotel-delayed/688334-5127314-8psrugz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post21.png
18,Kassanda traders count losses as power shutdowns continue - Daily Monitor,"KASSANDA. When Ronald Kyabasinga opened up an electronics  repair workshop in Bukuya Town Council, Kassanda District last year, customers started flocking to his shop because of his good customer care. They [clients] were bringing items such as radios, television sets and others, but I realised the problem was with the unstable electricity supply in this area where their appliances experienced electric shocks time and again,  Mr Kyabasinga says.He is currently repairing generators.A sizable number of traders in the town have switched to using generators due to constant power outages. The problem, according to traders, has persisted for more than three months. The only source of power now is either a generator or solar supply because one cannot rely on electricity supplied by Umeme, [national power distributor],  he says.At his workshop are clients queuing to have their generators fixed. Elsewhere around Bukuya Trading Centre, generators are a common sight at almost every shop and workstation.Among the most affected businesses are hair salons, electric appliance shops, welding workshops as well as coffee, maize and timber mills. This problem, according to Mr Musa Ogwang, a trader in Bukuya Town Council, has contributed losses in their businesses. This problem has persisted for long, but we are not getting clear explanations from Umeme. The last time they [Umeme] came here, they told us that the problem is with the small weak transformer. They replaced it with another, but the problem still persists, we are losing hope,  he says Currently, most traders, whose businesses run on high power voltages such as welders, have temporarily closed due to constant power outages.  I used to employ eight people here and most of them are young boys who dropped out of school, but I have been forced to send four of them away because they are so redundant here. I am also planning to discontinue the rest because I do not want them to keep playing from here without doing any work, they can even get involved in bad behaviours,  Mr Moses Ssebwato, who runs a metal welding workshop in the town, says.Mr Asansio Gayi, the Bukuya Town Council vice chairperson, says as local leaders, they have on several occasions petitioned Umeme officials and they are yet to receive a response.Mr Edward Zziwa Birungi, the Kassanda District vice chairperson, says he had received complaints and that he is going to seek council s attention.However, Mr Stephen Ilungole, the Umeme communications manager, says they received the complaint from traders and when they investigated, it was due to rampant illegal connections in the area, especially for trapping grasshoppers. They [grasshopper trappers] refused to use the transformer with a power metre, and chose to use another transformer for domestic users. So, the transformer was overwhelmed and could not serve all residents at a go,  he says. BackgroundIn April 2017, parts of Mubende District and the entire Kibaale District were thrown into darkness for several weeks following the theft of copper cables and angle bars on Mubende  Kakumiro  Kibaale power line. The power company is currently losing Shs106 billion annually from an average of Shs73b in 2014 due to power theft including non-payment of bills, vandalism and illegal connections.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kassanda-traders-count-losses-as-power-shutdowns-continue/688334-5127340-ljs5al/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post22.png
19,Farmers protest verification of seedlings supplied by government - Daily Monitor,"BUHWEJU/KANUNGU/NTUNGAMO/RUKUNGIRI.  Farmers under their umbrella body of Tea Nursery Bed Operators and Growers Association, led by Mr Frank Byaruhanga, have protested a repeated verification exercise of tea seedlings done by Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Operation Wealth Creation (OWC) and National Agriculture and Advisory Services (Naads). Those who were verifying worked with the District Internal Security Officer and Gombolola Internal Security Officers forced themselves into the fields, the political and other leaders never participated,  Mr Byaruhanga, who is also the LC5 councillor for Mpungu Sub-county in Kanungu, said.He said on Monday that it was not proper for Naads to repeat the verification exercise knowing that some of the seedlings were destroyed by the drought that hit the country in 2017.Officials had concluded the verification exercise of seedlings supplied in Buhweju, Ntungamo, Kanungu and Rukungiri districts in 2016 and 2017 under delegated procurement.The verification exercise took 19 days and ended on Sunday. The aim was to establish the existence of both beneficiaries and nursery bed operators (suppliers), who claim to have delivered seedlings to farmers in four districts for which they demand about Shs20 billion from government. The verification exercise has ended, the team is going come out with a final report,  OWC programme spokesperson, Maj Tabaro Kiconco, said on Monday.He added:  This exercise will help to weed out ghost claimants, and the fraudsters. It was intended to establish the acreage of the tea fields and traceability of the tea distributed under OWC programme.  Otherwise the tea enterprise is taking shape with demands of more factories from farmers in Ntungamo and Buhweju districts. One team worked in Kanungu and Rukungiri while another worked in Ntungamo and Buhweju. They conducted physical garden visits to verify planted seedlings and used Global Positioning System to determine the planted area. Similar exerciseHowever, a similar verification was done in the districts of Kabale, Mitooma, Rubirizi, Bushenyi, Isingiro, Sheema, Rukiga, Rubanda, Mbarara and Kisoro last year.Maj Tabaro said details of the findings will be in the final report.Another official who was on the verification team, said Rukungiri and Kanungu districts have less than 50 per cent of the tea claimed to have been supplied in the period.Naads gave the districts the mandate of procuring suppliers of tea seedlings (delegated procurement).Districts were supposed to identify nursery bed operators, contract them to supply tea to farmers and verify the tea before Naads pays them. However, Kanungu District executive members were opposed to the verification exercise. They placed announcements on radios urging the farmers not to cooperate with the verification team. Ms Josephine Kasya, the LC5 chairperson, argued that the verification exercise was done earlier and Naads had declined to pay the suppliers. She said they had to sue Naads in the Commercial Court in Kampala in July 2018 over the loss. We were surprised on April 29, when the officials from the Naads secretariat stormed the district saying they wanted to re-do verification exercise of the planted tea seedlings. We told them that we cannot repeat the exercise because the resolution at the mediation meeting was that Naads pays those who supplied seedlings.Now that Naads secretariat has opted to breach the mediation resolutions, let the courts of law take over the matter and decide,  Ms Kasya said while addressing farmers at the district headquarters on May 2.Dr Christopher Bukenya, the head of technical services at the Naads Secretariat, said he had not been briefed by the head of the verification team led by Mr Everest Mulumba.He, however, added that the findings from the exercise will guide government in paying those who supplied tea seedlings in the tea growing districts in South-Western Uganda.By  certain circumstances  Dr Bukenya was denoting the fact that suppliers did not have formal contracts with Naads. He added:  We were guided that despite the circumstances, we need to verify the tea that was planted, we are trying to correct something that went wrong. He said though the report has not been compiled, payments will be a process and will still depend on the success of the exercise. Dr Bukenya added that those who sued Naads might have made an error because they were not duly contracted to supply government.However, Mr Byaruhanga said independent districts were delegated to handle tea procurement starting from 2008. He said the farmers had by 2015 grown tea and when leaders and tea stakeholders from South-Western met the President in Gulu the same year, it was agreed that Kanungu, Kisoro, Kabale, Rukungiri, Isingiro and Ntungamo districts get tea factories. The President promised that government will allocate Shs220 billion for procurement of tea seedlings to be released in two financial years of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017,  Mr Byaruhanga added.Failure in paymentSome of the seedlings lost value from nursery beds and while some of those planted got destroyed by the 2017 drought, Naads could not verify and pay for them.After several efforts to get paid money they injected in the project failed, 717 nursery bed operators (from all tea growing districts in South-Western), in 2018, took Naads to court. Mr Byaruhanga said the matter is in court and the verification exercise was contempt of court.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Farmers-protest-verification-seedlings-supplied-government/688334-5125660-102liauz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post23.png
20,Potholes eat up Lira access road - Daily Monitor,"LIRA. Road users have expressed concern over the poor state of Olwol Road in Lira Town. Potholes are gradually eating away the busy road that stretches from All Nations Corner connecting Kwania Road via Lira Bus Park.Residents claim the potholes that have peppered most portion of the road, have made the Olwol Road almost impassable. The road is key because it serves motorists and passengers travelling from within Lira Municipality and the neighbouring districts such as Alebtong, Abim and Otuke to access Lira Bus Park. Mr Walter Okello, a boda boda rider, said several accidents have occurred on Olwol Road.  Just last week, a pregnant woman who was riding on a bicycle fell down after hitting a pothole,  he said. A motorcycle mechanic, Mr Benson Okullu, said the road is in a sorry state and that those using it are at risk.District leaders have, however, said the World Bank has approved additional funding for road construction in Lira Town under the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development (USMID) project. The acting municipal engineer, Mr Freddie Owiny, recently said plans were underway to develop and design Boundary, Obangakene, Independence, Lumumba-Ogengo, Jackson Oyuku, Ayer and Teso Bar roads in 2018/2019 financial year. So far, Obote Avenue, Oyam, Oyite Ojok Lane, Aroma Lane and Rwot Aler roads have been constructed, he said, adding that engineering design of Boundary, Olwol, Obangakene and Noteber roads has also been done with support from USMID.  We are fully committed to doing our best, both as technical officers and political leaders of the municipality and are determined to change the face of Lira for the better without fear or favour,  Mr Mike Ogwang Olwa- Veve, the Lira mayor, said.On May 17, President Yoweri Museveni commissioned Obote Avenue, one of the three roads constructed in Lira Town central business district under USMID. The other roads are Soroti and Kwania roads. The three roads measuring 2.8 kilometres were constructed at a cost of Shs21.4 billion. Town clerk Assy Abirebe recently told this newspaper that Lira Municipal Council had received Shs55 billion from the World Bank to fund the construction of 12 roads in the area. The roads to be constructed in this three under USMID s infrastructural development plan are the Boundary, Olwol, Obangakene, Note Ber, Oyam, Wonyaci, Ojwang Opota, Ogwang Edola, Agoro, Ayer, Teso Bar/ Corner Kamdini, Post Office, Bala, Aputi and Inomo.The project USMID, which was first launched in 2013, currently enhances the institutional performance of 14 municipal local governments countrywide, to improve urban service delivery. The beneficiary municipalities are Lira, Gulu, Soroti, Arua, Mbale, Jinja, Mbarara, Masaka, Entebbe, Fort Portal, Kabale, Moroto, Tororo and Hoima. The six-year project is expected to expand urban infrastructure and enhance the capacity of the 14 beneficiary municipalities to generate own revenues, improve urban planning, and strengthen financial management, procurement, environmental and social systems.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Potholes-eat-up-Lira-access-road/688334-5125686-n5wibtz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post24.png
21,New Mubende-Kagadi road boosts business - Daily Monitor,"KAKUMIRO/KAGADI. Residents of Kakumiro and Kagadi cannot hold their joy as construction of the Mubende-Kakumiro-Kagadi road takes shape.A section of residents have now put up roadside markets on the already completed section of the road to tap into business opportunities through selling their merchandise.The residents, mostly farmers, are selling different foodstuffs to the people driving on the new road, which had over the years been shunned by motorists because of its sorry state.The 104km road is being constructed by China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) at a cost of more than Shs480 billion.About 45kms of the road have already been completed, to the excitement of people who usually travel from Mubende to Kakumiro, Kibaale and Kagadi districts.Now, with the completed section lying between Kibaale Town in Kibaale District to Kibambula Trading Centre in Kakumiro District, foodstuffs such as bananas (matooke), beans, cassava and fruits are displayed on stalls all day long.Others are assembling charcoal bags beside the road to tap into opportunities coming with increased traffic on the road.Mr Gerald Turinawe, a resident of Kasongoire in Matale Sub-county, Kibaale District, is among the dozens of people who vend matooke at Busesa Trading Centre.   The road has already started helping us because as you can see, the place is like a full market. You cannot come here with matooke and fail to get customers. We are surviving on this roadside market,  Mr Turinawe said.He said with the proceeds from the roadside sale of matooke, he will increase the size of his banana plantation before venturing into vegetable gardens.Away from the roadside markets, the new road has led to the rapid increase in value for land as people are set to tap into the available opportunities.Mr Denis Kugonza from Kasojo Trading Centre in Bwanswa Sub-county, Kibaale District, said the cost of a 50x100ft plot of land has doubled from Shs4m to Shs8m.  The coming of the tarmac has increased the price of land here. All people want to build on the main road and that has increased the value,  he said.The Kakumiro District secretary for works, transport and technical services, Mr Eriya Twebaze, said upon completion, the road will increase the local revenue base because of increased investments. BackgroundAdvice. President Museveni, during his recent tour of Bunyoro sub-region, encouraged the people in the area to use the oil roads being constructed to increase their household incomes. The roads are for all people but how are you going to use them  Here, people should look at wealth creation and skills specialisation. People should be in commercial agriculture, small scale factories, and services like catering, hair dressing and food processing, among others,  the President said.The President said oil roads such as Buhimba-Nalweyo-Igayaza-Kakumiro; Masindi-Biso; Kabaale-Kizirafumdi; Hohwa-Nyairongo-Kyarushesha-Butole; and Hoima- Butiaba -Wanseko, would be worked on.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/New-Mubende-Kagadi-road-boosts-business/688334-5125702-137kf5kz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post25.png
22,"Government to revamp Bukalasa College, says minister - Daily Monitor","LUWEERO. Government is set to revamp Bukalasa Agriculture College in order to produce better extensionists with hands-on skills, Agriculture minister Vincent Ssempijja, has said.The minister said the partnership between Uganda and donor agencies, including the twining up of Bukalasa Agriculture College with Dalhousie University from Canada to transform Bukalasa to a centre of agriculture excellence, is part of their commitment to ensure that the college produces extension staff with hands-on skills that match the modern farming practices targeting commercial agriculture in Uganda. Government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, is already undertaking several strategies to ensure that Bukalasa Agriculture College, now producing the bulk of the country s agriculture extension staff, gets the necessary assistance in terms of manpower, technology, among other logistical support, to boost the agriculture sector. The increasing challenges in the weather patterns and the need for a robust transformation from subsistence to commercial-oriented farming sector calls for strengthened skills training,  Mr Ssempijja told parents and graduands at the 55th Bukalasa Agriculture College graduation ceremony at the college campus in Luweero District on last Friday.GruaduandsA total of 1, 083 graduands were awarded diplomas and certificates after successfully completing their respective courses in agribusiness management, animal production and management, crop production and management, horticulture, human nutrition and dietetics, among others.The minister said government has also prioritised the boosting of the service sector within the Agriculture ministry by recruiting more extension staff to help the farmers adapt to modern farming practices, with emphasis on commercial agriculture.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-revamp-Bukalasa-College-minister/688334-5125708-xwpof8z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post26.png
23,Island residents can t wait for MV Sigulu to start work - Daily Monitor,"Namayingo.  Mr Morris Ojambo, a resident of Ndaiga Village in Bukane Sub-county in Namayingo District is still coping with the death of his wife, two years after. The 50-year-old breaks down as he narrates how his wife developed complications and bled to death while giving birth because there was no nearby health centre. I wanted to take her to a health centre across the mainland but I failed because I could not get affordable means of transport,  Mr Ojambo says. Many families here cannot afford to hire a boat in time to transport their sick relatives. As a result, we end up losing our beloved ones under our watch,  he adds.Hiring a boat from Lolwe Island to Busiro Landing Site in Banda Sub-county to access a health facility costs more than Shs400,000.However, Mr Ojambo is optimistic that the situation will change when the construction of Sigulu ferry at Masese Landing Site is complete.The MV Sigulu will connect Sigulu and Lolwe Islands to Lugala mainland. The ferry was contracted to JGH Marine A/S, a Danish firm. Ms Benedict Nangosia, the chairman of Buhone Village, where a dock is being built, says:  We are happy that finally, we are going to have a ferry in this area. The number of accidents will also reduce on the lake. In 2016, a boat from Bukana Island to Bumalenge Beach in Sigulu capsized, killing all the people on board.Mr Geoffrey Ouma, another resident, says the ferry will create job opportunities. We will get odd jobs such as loading cargo, and it will also promote investments,  he says.Mr Peter Okumu Wanda, the district speaker, says the ferry will also promote tourism between the main land and the islands. Dolwe has a huge potential for tourism, including the magnificent art rocks, the bird species, boat racing, water rafting, which have not been exploited and we hope business is going to develop rapidly,  Mr Okumu says.Mr Ronald Sanya, the district chairperson, says they have been having challenges of deploying staff, especially teachers and health workers in the area. Many of the district workers deployed to work in Bukhooli Islands have been turning down our requests because they fear travelling on small boats to distant places like Dolwe but now that the ferry is complete, we are going to see more teachers and medical staff deployed in the island. This will improve service delivery,  Mr Sanya says. Ms Joyce Nambozo, the chief administrative officer, says the ferry will transport expectant women to the mainlands. We have lost several mothers in the islands due to lack of transport because the family cannot afford to hire a boat,  Ms Nambozo said.Ferry to sail soonRecently, Ms Allen Kagina, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) executive director, said construction works on the ferry were complete. Ms Kagina made the remarks while addressing project affected persons on the Majanji-Busia road.  This vessel is fitted with three engines, a 300-passenger seater space, huge cargo space and has most modern technology digital equipment to enable remote monitoring from Kampala, on engine performance, loading and location while sailing on water,  Ms Kagina, said. She said the construction cost about $4.3m (about Shs166b) and has been built to high standards to enable it have a high sea worthiness certificate. UNRA officials say the construction started in September last year and that the ferry has a load capacity of 300 tonnes.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Island-residents-can-t-wait-MV-Sigulu-start-work/688334-5125730-9h1ulw/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post27.png
24,Acholi clerics meet South Sudan rebel commanders - Daily Monitor,"Gulu. Clerics from Acholi Sub-region under their umbrella body Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative (ARLPI) have said their meeting with top South Sudanese rebel commanders will shape efforts made by other partners to end the conflict in the country.The meeting, coordinated by the UN Peace Office in Torit and Inter-religious Council of Eastern Equatoria State, was held in a rebel controlled territory in Torit county, Eastern Equatoria State last Friday.Retired Bishop Nelson Onono Onweng of Northern Uganda, also the ARLPI chairperson, told journalists in Gulu Town on Monday that they asked the rebel commanders to think of the consequences of the war and focus on the children and women who are largely being affected. We asked them whether they love their country and why they should be fighting again, we told them what we think would be better to stabilise their country and that would be cessation of hostility,  Bishop Onweng said.The prelates met the Sudan People s Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA/IO) top commanders, including Gen Justine Taban, the Eastern Equatoria State SPLA/IO commander.They visited the country on invitation of their counterparts, the Interreligious Council of Eastern Equatoria State on a benchmarking meeting themed  Amazing impact of unity of religious leaders. Bishop Onweng said they also held meetings with clerics from Eastern Equtoria State headed by Archbishop Bernard Oringa where they shared their experience in resolving wars.Sheikh Musa Khelil, the Acholi Muslim Khadi, said they urged the rebel commanders to keep their promises. We are impressed with declaration made by the rebel leaders not to go back to war again and cause any harm on the civilian population. We believe if they keep up to that promise, the conflict will end and South Sudan will become a better nation,  Sheikh Khelil said.Other officials on the Acholi team included Mr Francis Lukwiya, the ALRPI programme coordinator and Rev Patrick Lumumba from the Northern Uganda Diocese.BACKGROUNDLast year, South Sudan President Salva Kiir signed a peace deal with Dr Riek Machar, the SPLA-IO leader in an attempt to bring an end to the civil war. In April, Pope Francis kissed the feet of the two leaders and implored them to maintain peace that exists between them. Civil unrest broke up in South Sudan in 2013, following tension between forces loyal to President Kiir and Dr Machar.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Acholi-clerics-meet-South-Sudan-rebel-commanders/688334-5125738-11i94nl/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post28.png
25,Government in talks with Amin family over Arua airport expansion - Daily Monitor,"ARUA. The government is holding discussions with the family of former president Idi Amin to acquire large chunks of land for the expansion of Arua airport to international standards.Officials from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) say discussions have progressed well and they will soon enter an agreement.Mr Samuel Wonekha, the CAA general manager for regional airports, said he is hopeful that both parties will come to an agreeable position very soon. The issue of land in Arua; after we carried out the detailed master plan for the airport, the master plan dictated that some additional land must be acquired to implement the plan and we are actually looking for additional land,  said Mr Wonekha. Part of this land actually belongs to the former head of state. The family of late president Idi Amin own most of the land around the airport. We are moving on well with the talks and hope to secure this land very soon,  he added. CAA plansMr Wonekha said once the land is acquired, they will embark on the construction of the terminals and runways to accommodate different sizes of the planes. CAA wants to upgrade the airfield to Category 4C airport, which has field length of more than 1,800 metres.The category 4C airport can accommodate a plane of wing length of up to 24 metres. Arua airport currently has length of 1,800m, and officials from the CAA say the master plan demands that more land be availed to make the airport meet the required specifications.On delays to complete the compensation of those who own land near the airport, Mr Wonekha admitted that some rejected the initial government offer, while others have no letters of administration because the owners of the land died. In our report, we indicated that we have effected payment so far up to 98 per cent. For the 11 members, who have not been compensated yet, there are issues that range from the fact that the estates changed because people passed on and they are to secure letters of administration before their proper settlement. We also have people who objected to the value of their properties, which are under review by the government chief valuer and we are getting positive data from those affected and soon we are going to effect their payments,  he said. Mr Wonekha also said government is currently soliciting for $56m (Shs209.2b) for the general upgrading of the airport to meet the regional and international standards. He said the major works have been delayed because government has not secured the required funds. Government is still sourcing for financing of about $56m that will enable us to begin on the actual major project of upgrading the airport in Arua. However, the smaller components of the projects are ongoing but the major works will start when we receive the funding,  he said.Strategic position Arua is the second busiest domestic airport in the country after Entebbe, with a monthly average of 180 air traffic movements. Presently, Eagle Air operates scheduled flights with a 19- seater aircraft. Ad hoc and charter flights are also operated by Mission Aviation Fellowship, United Nations, AIM Air, Samaritan Purse and Kampala Aero Club and Flight Training Centre.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-talks-with-Amin-family-Arua-airport-expansion/688334-5123910-mcn44yz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post29.png
26,UPC to punish members for endorsing Museveni s sole candidature - Daily Monitor,"OYAM. The Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC) party has said it will discipline some of its members who recently endorsed President Museveni as the sole candidate for the 2021 presidential elections. On May 16, leaders of the Opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and UPC in Lango sub-region reportedly seconded a resolution, endorsing Mr Museveni as the sole candidate for the forthcoming elections. When the President convened a meeting at Oyam Boma grounds for all the local leaders in Lango sub-region to deliver his message of wealth creation, the resolution to endorse him for 2021 was moved by NRM and seconded by FDC and UPC members. Mr Ogwal Ojok, the NRM chairperson for Oyam District, read out a bi-partisan resolution, endorsing Mr Museveni as the sole candidate.Mr Ojok was seconded by Mr Onac Okello, the Kwania District chairperson (UPC), Mr Brian Ogutu, the Oyam District councillor and FDC chairperson; Mr Celestine Ouma, the Oyam District councillor (UPC), and Mr Masor Bashir, the male councillor (UPC). The UPC secretary general, Mr Fred Ebil Ebil, warned that the UPC leaders who endorsed Mr Museveni s sole candidature in the 2021 elections would face disciplinary action. Mr Ebil Ebil said the UPC regional office will this week convene a meeting of district party chairpersons to discuss the matter.  This is because those individuals do not hold any authority to make decisions on behalf of the country s oldest political party rather than the UPC National Council,  he said yesterday.  We are looking for evidence to pin those UPC members who were reported in the media to have endorsed Mr Museveni as sole candidate for 2021,  UPC secretary general added.According to Mr Ebil Ebil, UPC has never endorsed any presidential candidate because the party is also preparing to front their candidate for the top most political seat. We are not supporting anybody who has shown interest to contest for presidential elections of 2021 apart from UPC candidate,  he said in an interview.  But if the Opposition political parties decide to form a coalition and front a single candidate for presidency, that position can only be determined by the National Council of UPC but not anybody else,  he added. The Member of Parliament for Erute South in Lira District, Mr Jonathan Odur, said the people who are purported to have endorsed President Museveni on behalf of Lango to fulfil their selfish gains should be publicly condemned.  Less than 1 per cent of Langi cannot claim to have endorsed [President] Museveni without making any consultations in all the constituencies. These are people who are money hungry who have just joined NRM and they are trying to show that they are more powerful than those who were in NRM before,  Mr Odur said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UPC-punish-members-endorsing-Museveni-s-sole-candidature/688334-5123954-fhrmxoz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post30.png
27,Government starts relocation of Bududa landslide victims to Bulambuli - Daily Monitor,"Bududa. The truck groans and squeaks as it climbs the murram road. Perched on atop, between pieces of furniture and assorted personal effects.In the vans are men, women and children anxious to reach the promised land.  As perilous as it seems, this journey is a flight to safety. After months in makeshift camps, survivors of recent landslides on the slopes of Mt Elgon in eastern Uganda are finally being relocated to permanent homes in safer areas.   This is the day we have been waiting for,  said Mr Boaz Mutinye, a landslide survivor and head of Shisambwa Village in Bukalasi Sub-county.  We will live here happily with no life threats posed by the landslides,  he said. The relocation began slowly, with 10 households of 60 people moved to Bunambutye in Bulambuli District, where the government, through the Office of the Prime Minister, has built new homes.A few remain in temporary camps while more than 10,000 are living in their homes, which are at risk of landslides. About 100 households will be relocated over the next two weeks in the first phase. Each household will get a two-bedroom house on an acre of land, with another two acres for agriculture. The move has rescued survivors  from the jaws of death , says Ms Lydia Nandudu, who lost family members in the most recent landslide in Bukalasi.  We have been having sleepless nights whenever it rains. We will now sleep without disruptions,  she said, breaking out in a gospel song. Mr Isaac Mugera, an OPM spokesman, said heavy rain and difficult terrain had delayed the resettlement. BenefitsThe government, he said, will feed the families for a year, long enough for them to grow and harvest their own food.  A health centre has also been built nearby for the communities, although the recent arrivals will have to find places in area schools, as the new term is about to open. The UPDF s Engineering Brigade built the houses between December and March. Some 900 houses will be built at a cost of Shs32 billion on the 2,800-acre piece of land government acquired in 2013 as part of a 10-year resettlement plan. The plan has not been without challenges: residents attached to their ancestral lands and are reluctant to leave their landslide-prone homes, while disputes remain over the ownership and suitability of some of the resettlement land. For those lucky enough to get onto the relocation trucks, however, the relatively short journey away from the mountain slopes is a giant leap from danger and a chance to break new ground.ReallocationThe construction of 101 houses by the Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) Engineering Brigade and police s construction unit, started on December 15, 2018 and they were completed by March, 2019. According to the resettlement scheme on the 2,800 acres of land, which the government acquired in 2013, 250 houses will be constructed on Plot 94, which measures 270 acres. Plot 157, which is 918 acres, will house 650 houses, while Plot 198, measuring 1,688 acres, will be reserved for mechanised agricultural production.

28,S.Africa's parliament set to elect Ramaphosa president - Daily Monitor,"South African lawmakers were set to re-elect Cyril Ramaphosa as the nation's president on Wednesday, two weeks after the ANC returned to power in legislative elections.MPs from the African National Congress, which won 230 out of 400 seats on May 8, will choose the head of state in the parliament's first post-election sitting.The ANC won the ballot with 57.5 percent of the vote, its thinnest majority since the end of apartheid.Lawmakers were sworn in before the maiden session starting at 2.00 p.m. (1200 GMT).The next president will be sworn in on Saturday and name a deputy president and cabinet at the weekend.Under South Africa's 1996 constitution, electors vote for a party, and the party selects individuals who go to the National Assembly, which then chooses the head of state.Ramaphosa, 66, is a trade unionist who played a prominent part in the struggle against white minority rule before becoming a successful business after the end of apartheid.He will be serving his first full five-year term since taking over last year from Jacob Zuma who was forced out over a series of corruption scandals.Ramaphosa's first test as he starts his new term will be his choice of a cabinet -- a task beset by rival factions within the ANC.- Shadow of scandals -Prospects of a major reshuffle were heightened hours before Ramaphosa's expected return to office, when Deputy President David Mabuza announced he would defer taking his oath as a lawmaker.In a report, the ANC's integrity commission alleged Mabuza -- the party's No. 2 -- ""prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organisation into disrepute"".His name has repeatedly come up in media reports for corruption and political killings, when he was premier of the eastern Mpumalanga province before becoming vice president last year.He became the ANC's vice president in December 2017 when Ramaphosa was elected party leader. ""We have accepted and agreed to a request by the deputy president... to postpone his swearing-in,"" party spokesman Zizi Kodwa said on local TV news channel ENCA.Kodwa said it was not a given that Mabuza, as the party's vice president, would become the nation's deputy president.""The fact that he is deputy president of the ANC is not a guarantee or guarantor of a position of the deputy president of the republic,"" said Kodwa. Another senior ANC official, outgoing environment minister Nomvula Mokonyane, who has been named in the ongoing judicial inquiry into state corruption, has also pulled out and will not be an MP.The main opposition Democratic Alliance's chief whip in parliament, John Steenhuisen said the last-minute withdrawal by two senior ANC members is ""very clearly a sign that something is afoot in the ANC"".""It is completely bizarre ...and telling the divisions that exist within the governing party are continuing to exist and we are seeing manifestations of the various factions now playing out,"" said Steenhuisen.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/SouthAfrica-parliament-Ramaphosa-president--election/688340-5126826-oopqhu/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post32.png
29,Kenyan court due to rule on decriminalising homosexuality - Daily Monitor,"Kenya's High Court is on Friday expected to deliver a long-awaited ruling on whether to scrap colonial-era laws which criminalise homosexuality, a verdict that could have repercussions across Africa.However, the LGBT community fears yet another postponement. In February, the three-judge bench pushed back its decision, citing a heavy workload, prompting dismay from a persecuted community who have fought for years to be accepted.""There are a lot of mixed emotions around this because people are just wary of the fact that it could be postponed yet again,"" Brian Macharia of the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya (GALCK), one of the petitioners, told AFP.""Everyone is just hopeful and we recognise that things could go either way.""Gay rights organisations are asking the court to scrap two sections of the penal code that criminalise homosexuality.One section states that anyone who has ""carnal knowledge... against the order of nature"" can be imprisoned for 14 years. Another provides for a five-year jail term for ""indecent practices between males"".Activists believe Kenya has a chance to blaze a trail in Africa where homophobia is virulent in many communities, with similar laws in over half the countries on the continent.While convictions under the decades-old laws are rare, gay activists say the legislation is unconstitutional and fuels homophobia.The National Gay And Lesbian Human Rights Commission says it dealt with 15 prosecutions under the laws in 2018, with no convictions recorded.Unimaginable harmThe petitioners argue that under Kenya's 2010 constitution, every person is said to be equal before the law.However members of the LGBT community are blackmailed, evicted, fired, expelled from school, or assaulted over their sexual orientation, but are unable to access justice without effectively confessing to a crime.""LGBTQ people in Kenya for years and years have faced and suffered violence and harm in unimaginable ways, but justice has not been afforded to them because of the penal code,"" said Macharia.Activists are optimistic of an eventual ruling in their favour, given recent decisions by the court.In March, the High Court banned forced anal testing of men suspected of being gay.And in September, a court ruled that ""Rafiki"" (""Friend""), a film about a lesbian love affair which was the first Kenyan movie to be shown at the Cannes film festival, could be screened domestically for seven days after its initial banning.Macharia said Kenya's powerful churches had been holding special events in the leadup to the ruling to fight what they term ""the LGBT agenda"".""The church is spreading a lot of hatred, a lot of misinformation,"" he said.The petition is being fought by an association of Catholics, Protestants and evangelicals.Twenty-eight out of 49 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have laws penalising same-sex relationships, according to Neela Ghoshal, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) specialist in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.The death penalty is on the books, under Islamic sharia law, in Mauritania, Sudan and northern Nigeria, although there have been no known executions in recent times. In southern Somalia, gay men are believed to have been put to death in territory ruled by the Al-Shabaab jihadist group.Angola, Mozambique and Seychelles have scrapped anti-gay laws in recent years.On the other hand, Chad and Uganda have introduced or toughened legislation.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Kenyan-court-decriminalising-homosexuality-Gay-Lesbian/688340-5125998-lctu1w/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post33.png

31,Sudan protesters plan general strike as talks falter - Daily Monitor,"Sudanese protest leaders called on their supporters Tuesday to prepare for a general strike after talks with the country's military rulers stalled on who will lead an agreed three-year transition.Protest leaders had reached agreement with the ruling military council on the other main aspects of the transition.But early on Tuesday, the generals who overthrew veteran president Omar al-Bashir last month baulked at protesters' demands for a civilian head and a civilian majority for an agreed new sovereign council to lead the transition.""In order to achieve a full victory, we are calling for a huge participation in a general political strike,"" said the Sudanese Professionals Association, which took the lead in organising the four months of nationwide protests that led to Bashir's ouster.""The strike is our revolutionary duty and the participation in the sit-in ... is a crucial guarantee to achieve the goals of the revolution.""Protest leader Madani Abbas Madani told AFP the preparations for a ""general political strike and civil disobedience"" were already under way.""Whenever we will decide on applying these plans, we will make an announcement,"" said Madani, a prominent leader of protest umbrella group the Alliance for Freedom and Change.The two sides launched what had been billed as a final round of talks on the transition late on Sunday.The military council has faced pressure from Western government and the African Union to agree to a civilian-led transition -- the central demand of the thousands of demonstrators who have spent weeks camped outside army headquarters in Khartoum.When talks broke up early on Tuesday, neither side said when they would resume.Protest leader Siddiq Yousef told reporters they had been suspended.""The main point of dispute that remains is concerning the share of representatives of the military and the civilians in the council and who will be the head of the new body,"" the two sides said in a joint statement.The military council has been pushing for its chairman General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to head the new sovereign council but protest leaders want a civilian.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Sudan-protesters-plan-general-strike-talks-falter/688340-5125060-eoh923/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post35.png
32,Four human rights activists held in Zimbabwe - Daily Monitor,"Authorities in Zimbabwe have detained four human rights campaigners on their return home from a foreign trip and seized their cellphones and laptops, lawyers said Tuesday.""They were detained upon disembarking from a South African flight at Robert Mugabe International Airport last night and held for several hours without access to their lawyers,"" Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights spokesman Kumbirai Mafunda said.The men arrested late Monday were identified as George Makoni, 38, advocacy officer for the NGO Centre for Community Development Zimbabwe; Tatenda Mombeyarara, 37, co-ordinator for lobby group Citizens Manifesto; Gamuchirai Mukura, 31, executive director of Community Tolerance Reconciliation and Development (COTRAD); and Nyasha Mpahlo, 35, governance officer at Transparency International Zimbabwe.Lawyers were granted access to the four at Harare's central police station, five hours after the arrest, Mafunda told AFP.Police could not be reached for confirmation and it was not clear where the four had come from.Their arrest came days after state-owned daily The Herald ran a story claiming that ""a group of shady organisations with links to the (main opposition) MDC-Alliance has been hard at work laying the groundwork for civil unrest to be unleashed next month.""The newspaper said some activists had attended a workshop on the Maldives archipelago that was conducted by a non-profit Serbian organisation, Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS).The paper also claimed that some members of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) had earlier this month attended a workshop in Prague. Several organisations mentioned by the newspaper dismissed the story as false and denied involvement in any plot against the government.Zimbabwean authorities have in the past used brutal force including the use of live ammunition to crush dissent.After protests in January triggered by a hike in fuel prices of more than 100 percent, President Emmerson Mnangagwa warned that authorities would target rights groups deemed to be anti-government.Authorities blamed the protests on the MDC party and on non-governmental organisations that they said were backed by Western governments.The civil society alliance Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition condemned the latest arrests.""The police, government and state media have been colluding to criminalise the work of human rights defenders, laying unfounded allegations against civil society leaders as agents of regime change who want to topple the government,"" the coalition said in a statement.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Four-human-rights-activists-held-in-Zimbabwe/688340-5125080-69h9yf/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post36.png
33,Ocaya to bring his car dream to life - Daily Monitor,"Born to Silverno Orinyo from Zombo, Matthias Ocaya, 25, is one of the innovators in the vocational field, thanks to his persistence. An old student of Otoroga Boys Primary School in Zombo, Ocaya started dreaming about joining vocational education then, but his father would not hear any of it.  After Primary Seven, I told my father that I wanted to enroll in a vocational institute although he wanted me to continue to secondary school. So, I joined St Aloysius Secondary School in Zombo District and while there, my knowledge on innovation developed,  Ocaya recalls. He got career guidance and learned that he could actually go enroll in a vocational school after O-Level.  Whenever we got holidays, I would go to different people in my village for apprenticeship in plumbing work, building and wiring. I did that from Senior One holidays to Senior Four. In Senior Four vacation, I built myself a house and since I wanted to make a door for it, I went to a certain carpenter in my village to ask him for his equipment,  he says. But the carpenter instead asked him to come and help him at his workshop since he had no one to work with. Ocaya started work the following day.  I made my door but also learnt more skills, so, next, I made myself a bed but before I could take it home, a buyer asked for it. I told him I could make him one and he paid me Shs200,000. This was the first money I earned and through him, I got many more customers,  he narrates. Although Ocaya did carpentry work, being a mechanic was his ultimate dream. After Senior Four vacation, he still expressed interest in vocational education but his father still did not want him to go.  I joined A-Level at Paidha Senior Secondary School but class things had gotten a bit slow for me. I looked for a garage in the area where I would work at the weekend and during the holiday. It was then that I thought about making a prototype of a car from timber,  he says. Realising his dreamWith six points after A-Level, he joined vocational school. Ocaya joined Lugogo Vocational Institute in Kampala in 2016.  Two weeks into the course, I went to my lecturer and told him I wanted to build a car. He asked me how I was going to do it and told me to write a proposal with all the details and to also draw what I wanted to make. He also asked me whether I would be able to pull it off,  Ocaya explains. In first year, when real life projects were introduced and they were asked to make stoves, Ocaya had bigger fish to fry in mind.  In second year when they told us to build something, I just wanted to build a car. I already had my proposal and I told the teacher that I wanted to make a car, but he said that could not work. I went and talked to the head of department, who gave me a go ahead,  he recalls.Financial constraitsOcaya had no money. So during holidays, he went to the village and found work.  I earned Shs150,000 which I used to buy some things such as a motor, magnetar and other things for my prototype.  Ocaya spent two and a half months building the car in addition to building and designing things such as DC stoves, water pumps and a car heater for friends in order to get money for his prototype. After completing his prototype, he took it to the teacher and showed off his dream. The prototype was a solar driven car with an external steering wheel which he could use to control its movements.  But because I had a tuition debt, I went back to the village to look for money. From there, I was called by the principal for a vocational exhibition at Parliament in November 2017. I was also allowed to do my examinations. But when I went back to the village with my Shs400,000 that I had got from people who saw my innovation at the exhibition, I decided to build a big car which I am currently working on but won t give a lot of details about it for now,  Ocaya asserts.  I was also recently invited to an exhibition at UBTEB, where I exhibited my car before the Education minister Janet Museveni. But as I work on my big project, I also work in a garage in my village because I still have a debt at school,  he says. Ocaya needs about Shs95m to build his first big prototype of a solar driven car. Other student innovationsTogether with his robotics team, the International University of East Africa students built a car surveillance system. Andrew Bakashaba said, this is a smart home surveillance system that will have multiple functions. It will be able to; pick up sound, take videos, see what is at a distance, will be able to detect obstacles and able to control the lighting system in a home using a timer. It will also be able to pick feedback, move for example in a compound or house and do all those functions. I specifically did the parking coding that detects obstacles. We have built a control module/app that is connected to a mobile app, so it can connect everywhere, plus the camera module. We are still working on that body to adopt to functions and implement some parts but we want to have a working prototype soon. The surveillance car works as a proof of concept that we can build our own robots without studying a specific course.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Ocaya-car-dream-to-life-carpentry-work-Zombo-District/688336-5112776-rvg9my/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post38.png
34,Want to boost your career  Read - Daily Monitor,"Gives me confidenceMy job is to sell knowledge, history and tell a story the clients have no idea about. This has taught me to read constantly. Everyday I read something in relation to travel. Before taking any person to the site, I visit it first, make research and buy any written literature about it. I read any travel literature I come across naturally. I even read about the different Christian historical sites. I may not necessarily buy a book, but I carry out research and read online. This has opened my mind and widened my knowledge about different cultures. When I am talking to people; I speak with confidence because I am sure about what I am telling them. Mary Josephina Nanyonga, tours and travel dealerMotivated my career choiceMy reading journey started while in primary school. I enjoyed reading fictional stories such as Mr Hare tales because I found them entertaining. While in secondary school I would visit the school library to read novels during my free time. I read a book titled To Be the Best by Barbara Taylor which motivated me to aim higher and opened me up to more of her work such as A woman of Substance, which inspired me to pursue a career in finance. Currently, I read mathematics-related articles and mainly motivational books. My current read is Nice Girls Don t Get the Corner Office which talks about unconscious mistakes women make that sabotage their careers.Ann Kyakuwaire, auditorReading makes me practicalKyamanywa handles civil law cases to do with property, family issues that entail divorce, annulment, child custody. Because of his choice of work, he says his reading is not about to end. To manage handling the different cases I realised I need to have an inquisitive mind, excellent analytical skills and the ability to think.  At times clients expect an immediate answer. With this I came to a conclusion that lawyers need to be good readers. I read books such as Civil rights and Liberties in the 21 century, In Our Defense. The Civil Rights book gives an analysis of the Supreme Court s landmark rulings on civil rights and liberties. Reading has made me resourceful to my clients, taught me new court presentations and has helped me improve on my vocabulary. However, it calls for commitment. Currently, I am reading My Life in Court by Louise Nizer. Edward Cooper Kyamanywa, lawyerBroadened my thinkingMy reading culture started at the age of 10. In those early years I read a lot of adventure books. I would literally feel as if I was on the same adventure journey as the characters in the book. As a teen, I began reading literature from authors such as Jeffrey Archer, Wilbur Smith and Danielle Steele, which helped me understand new concepts about life and my vocabulary. While in high school he was introduced to African authors such as Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and others whose works gave him a new understanding of the continent. Today, I read different genres of literature, popular psychology, faith-based books, biographies, African books on history and economics, leadership and management books, motivational books. Reading has broadened my mind. I am able to know and understand a variety of topics. Currently, I am reading Purple Cow by Seth Godin, which is about avoiding being average. If you want to develop a reading culture, start slowly with one book at a time, those that you will enjoy, as well as joining a book club.Stirling Gapara, leadership and management consultantEnlightened meAmos Wekesa s reading culture did not develop until 2001 when he committed to reading for two hours a day. Reading different literature such as Transformation of Singapore from third world to second world, Problems of Africa, he says his reading kept improving. When reading, I spare 45 minute to read about a topic I am involved in. This has given me leverage over many people who come to me for information. I was influenced into reading by my wife. My wife is a good reader and so are my children. I realised if I did not read I would remain the idiot of the family. Writing has also given me an opportunity to read. The more you write, the more you read.Amos Wekesa, tourism entrepreneurKeeps my brain activeMy father used to read a lot. When I was a child, he would read to me story books written in Rutooro. Slowly, I began to broaden my reading scope. When I joined Nyakasura School, I started a newspaper called The Student. But today, I read medicine-related material, I read about the latest advances, news about medicine and I do a lot of research.  I keep tickling my brain by reading all the necessary literature within my profession and others I find relevant. Vincent Karuhanga, doctorLeaders are readers Leaders are readers. If you want to be a leader then you must be a reader. If you want to excel in any field such as being a politician or fashion designer you have to be a long-life learner and reader.  In life there has to be continuous improvement in all that we do. And the way you can improve is to continuously read.   If the last time you read a book was the time you graduated from university, yet you have been working for the last five years, it means you are stunted. As an educationist, I read constantly. I believe, the more you read, the better you become. Through reading I have been mentored by different people I admire but can never have conversations with. My recent great read has been by Michelle Obama s, Becoming. But currently I am reading The 15 Rules of Growth by John Maxwell. He says growth is intentional, not accidental. To inspire my children to read, each time any of them reads a book I put Shs10,000 in their piggy bank.

35,"Digital libraries, game-changer in rural schools - Daily Monitor","In October last year, Nyombi Thembo, the director Rural Communications Development Fund at the Uganda Communications Commission, announced government would introduce video conferencing lessons aimed at connecting rural schools to their urban counterparts. According to Thembo, the move is aimed at providing rural and urban students the same learning opportunities. We want a situation where a good Mathematics teacher in St Mary s College, Kisubi is giving a lesson, and some 100 rural schools in Karamoja following this lesson,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries. To support the move, National Social Security Fund (NSSF) has injected more than Shs450m to provide tablets to mainly underpriviledged secondary schools so as to compete favourably with priviledged schools.While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation, owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries.

While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent, especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.So far, the Fund has donated at least 440 digital learning tablets to 11 schools with each school receiving 40 tablets. The project is expected to benefit more than 3,500 students in Senior Four and Senior Six in the next one year and more than 5,200 students in the next two years. Aggrey Kibenge, the Under Secretary in the Ministry of Education and Sports, says the initiative will help students in underpriviledged schools to rise up to the occasion and compete favourably with their counterparts in priviledged schools.  Students in schools that do not have access to modern learning facilities will get exposure to and access modern learning resources and tools. I look forward to a time when all secondary schools will benefit from this type of digital technology to transform teaching and learning,  he said.Infrastructure issuesSanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher of Mpummudde Seed Secondary School, said he is supportive of the project and hopes it will help in reducing the workload for teachers and expose students to a wide range of learning materials as well as the digital world.However, he expressed worry that due to limited space in some government-aided schools for instance, as a result of the surging numbers in student population, buildings to house digital libraries must be put up.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space for this digital library. My teachers do not have where to sit because the staffroom is now occupied with the tablets,  he lamented. James Asili, the head of department for secondary schools and coordinator of the Digital Library project at NCDC, is optimistic that the tablet will prepare students for a digital curriculum with multiple content. The tablet costs Shs600,000 but Asili is hopeful that the cost will reduce with time. How the tablet works Ivan Mukasa, the software engineer in charge of the digital library project, says the digital tablets have been tailored to the school curriculum inclusive of all subjects for both O and A levels.  The tablet has been fitted with virtual learn software that incorporates the curriculum for both O and A levels. Each subject follows topics as designed in the curriculum. We shall keep modifying it to suit the students  needs,  he reveals.He further explains,  At the end of each topic, a student can do a self-assessment basing on the three levels of assessment. If the student fails the assessment, they are advised to retake and complete it. All the students  work and assessments are stored on the cloud for review by teachers as well as NCDC officials for analysis on how students are progressing in different subjects, for instance by analysing the difficult and easy topics.    It is also designed with an e-book readers  icon which enables students to buy online text books and read on their own. The virtual learn also permits performance tracking by schools and parents that can be accessed on Android mobile phones,  Mukasa adds.The tablet can be used both online and offline. Even better, a solar backpack has been provided in cases of power blackout or shortages.  At first the goal was to develop a virtual lab for sciences but then later we agreed to incorporate both arts and sciences. Students can even tap into the syllabus and read ahead of the teacher and do assessments.  Students react Hendrick Oboth, a Senior Six student, says he is enthusiastic about the digital library and hopes it will improve his learning.  I have realised there are things teachers fail to explain well in class but which you can read and understand on the tablets on your own. Similarly, Doreen Mugala, a Senior Four student, says it will ease her studies and help her get more details through research.  I will also be able to acquire skills in ICT which I may require in future,  she hopefully says.Knowing how many rural school grapple with poorly stocked libraries or nonexistent libraries at all, digital libraries could be the timely intervention to bridge the gap between rural underprivildged schools and priviledged ones.Other edu-tabsKaino Africa, a smart school management tech company last year launched their flagship product, the Kaino Tablet crafted for the Ugandan primary pupil. This Education Technology (EdTech) tablet comes with curriculum aligned teacher guides that show the teacher lesson plans; how they are supposed to proceed with the class, what examples to give as well as time the lesson is supposed to start and end. It comes with well-prepared notes from Ugandan content providers, not to mention, it has offline and online past papers, exams and instant assessments at the end of the tests. All this comes in addition to digitalised text books that are cheap (between USD1 to USD10) (about Shs38,000).BeneficiariesThe beneficiary schools include: Mpummudde Secondary School in Jinja, Nabumali High School Mbale, Atutur Seed Secondary School in Soroti, Sir Tito Winyi Secondary School in Hoima, Kagamba Secondary School in Mbarara, Kyenjojo Secondary School in Fort Portal and St. Charles Lwanga SS, Kasasa in Masaka.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Digital-libraries-game-changer-rural-schools/688336-5101196-e93vek/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post40.png
36,Essay challenge brings students  knowledge on biotechnology to life - Daily Monitor,"In a bid to familiarise students with modern biotechnology, National Crop Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) organised the Biotechnology Essay Writing Contest among secondary and university students.Resty Nansubuga, the 17-year-old science student at St Joseph s Girls Senior Secondary School, who scooped the best essay award in the secondary school category, says she only learnt about plant breeding using modern biotechnology in a bid to develop Genetically Modified Organisms crops from her teacher recently.Her essay focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food under the theme;  Modern Biosciences for more nutritious food . She explained the use of breeding crops using advanced technology to develop improved varieties which have better nutrition and are high yielding hence capable of feeding the world s growing population.Organised by the Uganda Biosciences Information centre, the competition attracted several students who, like Nansubuga, had scanty knowledge about crop breeding. Widespread issueBut this lack of knowledge is also true in majority of Ugandans who are ignorant about plant breeding using modern biotechnology and mistake improved plant varieties such as hybrids with GMOs.Thus scientists at NaCRRI have put in efforts to sensitise school children right from primary to university level by organising essay competitions where the students are required to search for information about application of modern biotechnology in plant breeding. The 6th edition of the essay competition awardees were given certificates, plaques, laptops and a one-week internship training at NaCRRI.This was the first time most of the competing students were visiting the research institute and its laboratory where tissue culture cassava breeding is being done by breeding them in tests tubes. The students were also amazed to see tissue culture cassava growing from test tubes to a full plant in the field.Enlightened Nasubuga was excited to receive her award and promised to sensitise fellow students at her school and other communities on the importance of scientists using emerging technologies to breed crops. I do not see any difference between improved cassava, maize and rice varieties with the traditional varieties being tested at the institute. I have heard that many Ugandans are opposed to improved crop varieties but it seems people lack knowledge about what the scientists are doing,  she asserted. Students submitted essays under the topic modern Biosciences to produce better nutritious food while Nsubuga focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food citing orange sweet potato and cassava which is bred conventionally and pro vitamin A treangenic banana which contains Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.She is optimistic that she will encourage fellow students to read scientific books to get knowledge especially in Biosciences be it in crop breeding of applied science to developing vaccines and drugs in the health sector.For Marvin Steven Nsubuga, the overall winner in the tertiary and university category, this is his third time participating in the awards. He submitted his first essay in 2015 when he was a Senior Five student and won an accolade, a certificate and a one-week internship at the institute.Nsubuga, a first year Administrative Science student at Kyambogo University, researched on using applied modern biotechnology to breed crops which can be used as a raw material in order to boost the industrial sector. He focused on crops such cassava which farmers will be able to grow and get high yields which can be supplied to brewing industries.  The starch can also be used to process glue and highly processed cassava flour used by industries processing confectionary products. I am currently disseminating this information for government to make good policy,  he noted.On his third time competing, Nsubuga scooped a certificate, plaque, a laptop and a one week internship at the institute. More student researchHe is encouraging university students to be in search of scientific information, especially in agricultural science where scientists are breeding crops to address challenges of climate change and devising ways of feeding the growing population in the world.National Agricultural Research Organisation board chairman, Prof Joseph Obua, urged students to pursue science subjects because science is a driver and engine of economic growth of all nations. I am urging teachers to use the best methods when teaching science subjects; make it simple and practical. This is because children tend to shy away from science subjects because teachers are using complex words which scare them. It is important to simplify the words for students to appreciate science, technology and innovations,  he noted.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Essay-challenge-brings-students-knowledge-biotechnology-life-/688336-5101200-d2t4y2z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post41.png
37,Startup tips crucial to vocational students - Daily Monitor,"One of the major challenges vocational graduates face is lack of start-up capital despite being trained to be job creators not seekers. This sometimes forces them to end up in the job seekers pool which their training was trying to avoid.For a long time, Sophie Joyce Laker, a Fashion and Design student at Kitgum Technical Institute, would worry about starting a business citing lack of money. What Laker did not know though, was that mindset is the first capital and for as long as one s brain is functional, they can do anything they set out to do. She also came to learn that an entrepreneur must not keep complaining about challenges such as rent and delays in supplies but rather always devise solutions. The Fashion and Design student has since started a business; Rwot-Twero Workshop in Kitgum Town. But it was not until the Skills for Life programme recently that Laker realised all this and more about mentorship in business.Thirty youthful entrepreneurs from Kitgum Technical Institute and Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute in Gulu, received training in business start-ups and expansion skills from Enterprise Uganda experts, to ensure their dreams are realised. Subsequent follow-up visits to measure their progress coupled with mentorship have been ongoing since. Funded by Uganda Breweries (UBL), this expert training and mentoring under the Skills for Life programme aims at avoiding this. Launched in 2001, the programme has so far seen more than 114 scholarships awarded to academically deserving yet economically disadvantaged students with the aim of curbing youth unemployment and high school dropouts.The problemUganda s small and medium scale businesses are estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000; employing 2.5 million people (about 90 per cent of private sector jobs) and contributing about 20 per cent to the country s Gross Domestic Product, while producing 80 per cent of manufactured output. In fact, studies have ranked Uganda as one of the most entrepreneurial nations in the world. However, the business failure rate is equally high   standing at more than 50 per cent. This is due to various challenges, including lack of financial support and vital skills including entrepreneurial, management, marketing and financial planning. Other challenges include lack of business records, low corporate governance, poor banking and borrowing history, a culture that disrespects business contracts, fierce local and international competition and limited access to business development services.In fact Anjijuka Narasi Kambaho, the senior information and communication officer at Uganda Business and Technical Examinations Board, says starting personal businesses is not always easy for vocational trained graduates. There are expenses involved including purchasing the necessary equipment, paying rent and the required licenses needed for operation. Sometimes people want to first get formal jobs in order save and accumulate money for starting their own businesses later,  he says.Registered successAt Enterprise Uganda, a public-private institution aimed at promoting SMEs as the main vehicle for expanding production, providing sustainable jobs and enhancing economic growth, the Acholi youth are likely to avoid falling on the wayside like many similar businesses countrywide.  The mindset and entrepreneurship training model is an effective standard in transforming the behaviour of participants and triggering the desired action to start a business. This is corroborated by the statistic where 26 out of the 30 students actually started business after the December 2018 training, representing a 87 per cent success rate,  says Rosemary Mutyabule, the lead trainer. One such students is Nelson Mandela, of Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute who believes his poultry business can help him contribute to his family and community. Located in Custom-Corner Village, Layibi Division in Gulu municipality, Mandela s farm has 235 22-days old broiler chicks, fully vaccinated in line with the requirements from the trainers. During a visit to assess his business last month, it was discovered that Mandela, who mainly sells to roadside chicken roasters in Gulu Town feels his enterprise is delivering tangible benefits. He has earned Shs1.9m in chicken sales from his first stock giving him a profit of Shs300,000.  This poultry business is giving me a sense of purpose in life. I even sell the chicken droppings and earn at least Shs5,000 every 100kg sack,  Mandela says. Paul Otim, a Gulu-based business counsellor and mentor, who assessed Mandela s farm, believes, that though new, the enterprise has great potential to grow given the market opportunities available and the determination of the young entrepreneur.  A planned farm exposure visit will undoubtedly reinforce his potential to develop the business, especially on technical methods of handling the poultry, cost saving using local resources plus proper records management,  says Otim. Follow-upBroadly, the Skills for Life programme does not stop at the training or skilling phase, but the beneficiaries undergo various follow-up visits by the implementers who ensure the trainees  learning and development is in fulfillment of the programme s objectives.The latest additions to this initiative are 20 students of Kabale s African College of Commerce and Technology and another 20 from Datamine Institute in Kampala for whom UBL has provided up to about Shs115m to cover tuition for their second year of study, entrepreneurship training as well as seed capital for those that would have excelled in the programme.And for Sunday Auma Okee, an Electrical Systems and Maintenance student at Kitgum Technical Institute, the scholarship, aside from helping him stay in school, has helped him learn to start a business with what he has and in fact his dream of opening an electrical workshop seems closer. Interventions Edward Asiimwe, the principal at Uganda Rural Development and Training institute, says policy makers, the government in particular needs to support vocational training at all levels.  Just like in other education sectors, increased funding and investment is also mandatory in vocational institutions.  In addition, Asiimwe believes that students need to be continuously given the proper career guidance to enable them make better informed academic choices.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Startup-tips-crucial-vocational-students/688336-5101216-aaicob/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post42.png

Apart from tuition, he has to buy scholastic materials and other fees as directed by the school. Byaruhanga is not your rich parent but he sure is among the growing list of parents who year by year join the private schools trend as the best way to educate their children.  The problem with universal primary education schools is that the population in class is too high. It is possible to find more than 200 pupils in one class. Private schools have a small teacher to pupil ratio. You will find 50 pupils in a class which is manageable. A child in a class of many pupils will not learn anything and might take long to understand,  Byaruhanga says. In 1997, government introduced Universal Primary Education. Under this arrangement, four children in every family were to study free of charge in all government-aided primary schools. Almost 10 years after UPE, the government introduced Universal Secondary Education becoming the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education. But despite this, parents are increasingly parting with huge sums of money to educate their children in private schools. As such numbers of private schools increase each year.According to the Uganda Schools Guide website, as of today there are more than 13,000 private schools in 127 districts in Uganda. Among the private schools are the high end ones that offer foreign curriculums and target wealthy parents and the ones that target middle income earners. The endless challenges plaguing most public schools have increasingly eroded public confidence. They have been labelled as for the  poor  forcing some parents to take children to private schools where they hope to find better education for their children.The increase in enrollment of students has not only accelerated a rise in private schools across the country; but also the cost of education. Overwhelming numbersIn January 2018, Alex Kakooza, the permanent secretary of Ministry of Education and Sports while at the Senior One selection exercise at Uganda Manufacturers Association grounds announced that government had scrapped Universal Secondary Education in private schools under the Public Private Partnership (PPP). At the peak was a challenge of funding and an increasing number of ghost students. This did not go down well with parents who had fear of transferring their children to public schools for the USE programme dreading the appalling conditions of overcrowding. For instance, at Masindi Secondary School, a government funded school, students study in shifts; some in the morning to noon while others from 2pm to evening. According to Byaruhanga,  Some parents take their children to UPE schools because the tuition is relatively lower there. Personally I do not have much money but I want my children to at least have a good education. I would rather pay in installments to make sure that my children study in a private school. But the move to scrap USE from private schools was intended to raise money and ensure that every sub county has a public school. According to Kakooza, more than 615 government sub-counties had no secondary schools. At the time, government would pay Shs47,000 for each student per term in a private school under the USE programme. Mpumudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District is one of the new schools established by government to create equity in providing education across the country. However, since its establishment, the school is still housed in Mpumudde Primary School buildings with a few new classroom blocks. Sanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher, recently expressed worry over a surging student population with no facilities while at the launch of a digital library at the school.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space where to put this digital library. My teachers have nowhere to sit because the staffroom is now full of digital tablets,  he said.  We want extra building materials and land for expansion and creation of access roads and a laboratory with chemicals and equipment,  he added.Aggrey Kibenge, the undersecretary at the Ministry of Education and Sports who was the chief guest at the event gave a one worded response.  We shall look into the matter at the ministry.  High price to pay With appalling conditions in both public primary and secondary schools, private schools have been increasing over time to attend to the needs of frustrated parents but at a much higher cost.According to the ministry of Education, the Private Schools and Institutions department was inaugurated in 2008, consequent to the restructuring of the ministry to cater for the ever expanding private investment in education. Since the government decision to liberalise the education sector in 1993, thousands of schools and institutions have been set up by private investors. In the secondary sub-sector, the number of private schools, at about 4,000, is more than double the number of government-funded schools. Light Academy on Entebbe road is one such private school that specifically cater for the middle class who can afford the fees. Mahad Budda, a student at Light Academy (former Turkish), says the school charges between Shs1.8m and Shs2m per term and the fees increase termly. However, he says, the services are worth the money because the teacher-student ratio is low with each class stream having between 28 and 32 students. He adds that the sickbay is good with fulltime nurses as well as better accommodation.Other private schools around Kampala and Wakiso districts charge between Shs500,000 and Shs2m as tuition fees for either day or boarding section. Scraped fundingAt the start of 2018, the ministry of Education scrapped funding to 792 private secondary schools which had been implementing the Universal Secondary Education programme. The ministry officials argued that the government has built capacity over the years in areas where they did not have any government-aided schools and are now ready to absorb those students in these institutions, adding that this, however, will be done in phases. The move left an estimated number of students who were expected to benefit from the Public Private Partnership in Senior One stranded.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/private-schools-children-UPE-a-laboratory-parents/688336-5112742-11d5ivi/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-23/post43.png
39,The right time to get a master s degree - Daily Monitor,"There is an increase in the number of universities in the country, making it easy for one to acquire qualifications. And as such many young people are going for graduate studies soon after their undergraduate qualifications, and as with many issues, this, too, has its advantages and disadvantages. Before Rosta Asiimwe completed her undergraduate degree in Human Nutrition, she had applied for a Masters in Public Health Nutrition.  I worked on-and-off for five months with research organisations. That little experience motivated me to take my master s degree seriously. Previously, I was just going through the motions but then I became interested in research. Besides, the pay is good in research work. The advantage of rushing into a postgraduate programme early is that you are still young and have the time to concentrate. On the downside, you tend to continue in the same course you began at undergraduate level. Gaining work experience opens the mind to a variety of career choices. The merits of growing your career first Spending a few years in the work arena can help a person focus their career goals. Grace Kenganzi, who has a Bachelor s degree in Mass Communication, undertook a postgraduate in Media and Communications after working for more than three years in a media house.  By that time, I was sure of the experience I wanted to attain   the kind that I could not get from my workplace. I had majored in public relations in my undergraduate course and since I worked for a media organisation, I had learnt on the job. I was more deliberate as I looked for a postgraduate course; I did not want just any media course because in the future, I want to branch into communication,  said Kenganzi.Samuel Bakutana, the chief executive officer Inspired Leaders International, says by concentrating on growing a career, a person comes to terms with the real demands of the job world, instead of making up their mind based on what they are told in the lecture room.  The working experience gives you a more mature perspective. By the time I went for my Master s in Leadership, I was already aware of the glaring gaps, the available opportunities and the needs of my future work. I approached the studies with a more mature, sober and committed attitude,  he says, adding:  A working background enables you relate with the programme content at a more real, practical and personal level because you have gone through the scenarios (or have examples to draw from) being presented in the course materials as you progressively apply the new or renewed learning. The financial questionWhen you are younger, chances of getting a scholarship are higher than if you are above 35 years. However, all is not bleak.  There are specialised programmes, for example The Chevening Scholarship Programme, that only gives scholarships to people who have careers,  Kenganzi says, adding,  You can only know about them when you are working. If I studied my postgraduate much earlier, I would not have thought of studying abroad or applying for a scholarship. Generally, because a master s degree can be expensive and students may be uncertain about what they want to do with their lives, students should gain some real-world experience before beginning a master s degree programme.Fitting into the labour marketEmployers are comfortable employing someone who already has job experience because, from a purely financial perspective, training of new staff is expensive and may not pay off immediately. Kenganzi believes her work experience and her master s degree gives her an edge.  I know what I want and I will ask for it. I cannot just accept anything thrown my way.  Asiimwe is not so confident.  Getting a job will be quite tricky. In the Ugandan (labour) market, (work) experience is the password and I know those who have it have an advantage over me.
