0,Telecom giant MTN lists shares on Nigeria's stock exchange - Daily Monitor,"Africa's largest mobile phone operator, MTN, listed shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) on Thursday in a $6 billion flotation reflecting its increasing presence in the Nigerian market, its largest.MTN bosses said the move showed their confidence in Nigeria's economy, following years of difficulty with the government.""We live and we work in Nigeria, now we are also listed in Nigeria,"" said Ferdi Moolman, chief executive of MTN Nigeria, adding the company was ""proud to contribute to the growth of the NSE"".South African-owned MTN says it has about half the market by revenue in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.Jude Chiemeka, NSE head of trading called the flotation a ""landmark event"".The company also sees huge possibilities in mobile money, a transfer feature via mobile phones popular in several countries across the continent but that has yet to take off in Nigeria.""We're looking at mobile money, which has huge potential, not only for now but for the future,"" Moolman told reporters in Lagos. ""We estimate there are up to 50 million Nigerians with no access to bank accounts.""The flotation comes after years of difficulty in Nigeria, with MTN battling mammoth fines by the country's regulators.In December 2018, MTN agreed to pay $53 million to resolve a row with Nigeria's telecoms regulator (NCC), after being accused of illegally repatriating $8.13 billion to South Africa.The decision to impose fines shocked MTN and its foreign investors, with four commercial banks involved in the transfer also fined.The sanction was the latest in a series of fines to hit MTN since it began operations in Nigeria 17 years ago.In 2015 it was fined $5.2 billion in 2015 for failing to disconnect unregistered SIM cards on its network.The fine was later reduced to $1.7 billion after negotiations with the Nigerian government.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Telecom-giant-MTN-lists-shares-Nigeria-s-stock-exchange/688340-5120556-dag39uz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post0.png
1,Four domestic workers arrested over death of minister Kibuule s twins set free - Daily Monitor,"Police have released four people who had been arrested over the death of water minister Ronald Kibuule s twins Rayden Waswa and Raymond Kato.Two house helps, a shamba boy and a security guard working at Kibuule s home were on Monday arrested by Mukono Police on neglect of duty charges contrary to Section 227 of the Penal Code Act.Police had accused all the four domestic workers of negligence leading to the death of the minister s two-year-old twins after they drowned in a family swimming pool at his home in Mbalala, Mukono District.They were released from Mukono Police Station on Friday afternoon on orders of Mr Kibuule who doubles as Mukono North MP. When contacted, Kampala Metropolitan police Spokesperson, Mr Patrick Onyango said the minister had phoned police saying he had forgiven the suspects. It is true Mr Kibuule has forgiven the two house maids, a shamba boy and a security guard,"" Mr Onyango told this reporter on Friday afternoon.He said Mr Kibuule ordered their release because there was nothing to gain even if he decided to take them to court.In speeches at the funeral service on Wednesday former minister Mike Mukula, in remarks echoed by Mukono Bishop, Rt Rev William Ssebagala, rebuked individuals who gloated particularly on social media over the children s demise. Others, among them Willy Rugo, who sent a letter to Daily Monitor for publication, questioned why a large swimming pool on the home compound was not barricaded, noting that tragic as the twins  drowning was, the parents were  negligent .  Such comments, which critics said contradicted cultural norms and common decency, dominated the messaging by influential leaders, both clergy and politicians.  It is shameful when you go to radios and social media to abuse someone who has lost a person, it s not good,  said Mr Mukula, a member of the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party s Central Executive Committee.  Minister Kibuule, who represents Mukono North constituency in the 10th Parliament, subscribes to NRM. Mr Mukula added:  Some people wanted to make it [the twins  demise] political [so that] they could undermine and abuse [Kibuule s family]. Kibuule, Uganda loves you, be strong [and] as a man, the God who gave you [the twins] will replace them.  Bishop Ssebagala in his sermon questioned the morals and upbringing of Ugandans who take death as a joke and scorn grieving families.  I want to add on Mr Mukula s message that stop taking death as a joking matter  I think everyone has ever lost someone, and felt how sad it is,  he said. The children drowned when both parents were away from home.  My twins have gone to heaven and I must prepare to meet them,  minister Kibuule said, adding:  My children have been a blessing.   The minister said he now has seven surviving children.  President Museveni, in a speech read by Vice President Edward Ssekandi, described the children s passing on as a  big loss not only to you (Kibuule) and your family, but to the entire nation. Parliament Speaker Rebecca Kadaga, who said she had ever lost more than one relative at the same time, urged Mr Kibuule to be strong.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Four-domestic-workers-arrested-death-minister-Kibuule-twins/688334-5120422-2uqy5b/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post1.png

3,Two Congolese nationals detained in Masaka on armed robbery charges - Daily Monitor,"MASAKA. Police in Masaka District are holding two Congolese nationals over alleged involvement in separate armed robberies in Masaka sub-region in central Uganda.The suspects detained at Masaka Central Police were reportedly in possession of forged Uganda national identity cards.One of them has been working as a cook at Good Foundation Primary School in Nyendo, Masaka.The two were arrested in a joint security operation between police and the army following an increase in reported armed robbery cases in the area.Police say the suspects and others still at large have staged over 10 armed robberies in Masaka District since February this year leaving about five people dead and at least 15 others injured.

4,"Pregnant US teen killed, baby taken from womb - Daily Monitor","Police in Chicago charged three people Thursday in connection with the murder of a pregnant teenager whose unborn baby was taken from her womb after her death. Police said Marlen Ochoa-Lopez, 19, was lured to the home of someone she knew on April 23 with the promise of free baby supplies, was instead strangled to death, and her baby extracted from her womb. Clarisa Figueroa, 46, and her daughter Desiree, 24, have been charged with first degree murder. Piotr Bobak, 40, whom police described as the elder Figueroa's boyfriend, was charged with concealing the murder. At a news conference, Chicago police chief Eddie Johnson called the crime ""disgusting and thoroughly disturbing.""""I can't even pretend to imagine what that family is going through right now. They should be celebrating the birth of a young baby. Instead, they're mourning the loss of the mother and possibly that young child,"" Johnson said. Police allegedly discovered Ochoa-Lopez's body hidden in a garbage can while serving a search warrant at Figueroa's home Tuesday night. ""Apparently, Miss Ochoa had bought other baby items from Clarissa, so they knew each other,"" deputy chief Brendan Deenihan said. On the day of Ochoa-Lopez's disappearance, Figueroa allegedly spoke with her through Facebook. The nine-months-pregnant teen went to Figueroa's home expecting to gather some baby clothes and other donated items, police said. Authorities allege Figueroa and her daughter Desiree strangled the expectant mother with a coaxial cable and extracted the baby. Within four hours of when Ochoa-Lopez was last spotted driving on a road by surveillance cameras, the elder Figueroa called emergency services claiming she had delivered a baby that was not breathing.The child has been hospitalized and reportedly is in serious condition. Police declined to confirm the baby's medical status. Police said their missing person case took a turn when they first learned of the Facebook conversation and interviewed the Figueroas on May 7. They obtained a search warrant after DNA evidence proved the baby was related to Ochoa-Lopez.

5,Lango Opposition leaders endorse Museveni for 2021 - Daily Monitor,"OYAM   Some Opposition leaders in Lango sub-region on Thursday pulled a surprise when they seconded the resolution endorsing President Museveni as the sole candidate for the 2021 presidential elections. Opposition leaders from Uganda People s Congress (UPC) and the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) ignored their political affiliations and joined their colleagues in the ruling National Resistance Movement to declare Mr Museveni a sole candidate in the forthcoming general elections. The resolution to endorse President Museveni as a candidate for 2021 was moved by NRM and seconded by FDC and UPC members. Mr Ogwal Ojok, the ruling National Resistance Movement Chairman for Oyam District read out a bi-partisan resolution endorsing President Museveni as the sole candidate in the forthcoming general elections. Mr Ojok was seconded by Mr Onac Okello, the LC5 Chairman for Kwania District, an ardent member of UPC, Mr Brian Ogutu, the LC5 councillor and Chairman FDC in Oyam District, Mr Celestine Ouma, the UPC LC5 councillor and secretary for Finance and administration in Oyam District and Mr Masor Bashir, the male workers  councillor. The President grinned and looked on incredulously as Opposition leaders made it clear to an electrified crowd that they do don t belong to the NRM party, but only support what they called  President Museveni s great development efforts  including infrastructure development and democracy. The Opposition leaders gave Mr Museveni a shield, spear and a stool to symbolise power. The northern region has witnessed unprecedented growth since the defeat of Joseph Kony s Lord s Resistance Army that had waged a war and disrupted peace in northern Uganda. Until recently, Lango and Acholi sub-regions have been Opposition strongholds. I must thank our leaders in Northern Uganda for supporting government's efforts to restore peace. With stability now assured, people should not just stay as spectators in the fight to create wealth,  Mr Museveni told the crowd.Oyam district NRM chairman (3rd R) reads the Lango region resolutions endorsing President Museveni as sole candidate as UPC and FDC party representatives (L) look on. (R) are Hon Sam Engola and Okello Engola. PPU PHOTO Like I have said in the other regional meetings, wealth creation falls in four main sectors; commercial agriculture, industries, services and ICT. The four-acre model is important for commercial agriculture. He added:  Government is in the process of setting up industrial parks in several sub regions to encourage the youth start small scale industries. In support of this initiative, government will create SACCOs in every district to make capital accessible for such activities. President Museveni who is currently on a wealth creation nation-wide tour is still camped in Lango sub-region and is expected to hold a rally in Lira town and later address the nation at a press conference. These engagements with political and technical leaders are important because they understand the people they lead and therefore know how to best disseminate our gospel of wealth creation,  he said.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Lango-Opposition-leaders-endorse-Museveni-2021/688334-5119522-ofs6u/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post5.png
6,New details on key suspect in Magara murder emerge - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. New details have emerged on how Patrick Kasaija, alias Pato, a key suspect in the kidnap and murder of Susan Magara, who was extradited from South Africa on Wednesday, attempted to evade security detection before they allegedly received the Shs700m ransom.Pato, who is detained at Special Investigations Division at Kireka, on the outskirts of Kampala was using two passports (one with the name Patrick Agaba and another Patrick Kasaija) as he travelled to and from different countries. Police spokesman Fred Enanga said on February 17, 2018, Pato left Entebbe International Airport for Zimbabwan capital, but when he reached Nairobi, he claimed he was from Accra, Ghana, and was returning to Uganda. Concealing evidence He returned to Uganda on the same day,  Mr Enanga said.On the day a ransom was paid, police said Pato travelled by road, through Botswana to South Africa. Magara s body was dumped on Entebbe Expressway the next day.Pato is charged with Yusuf Lubega, 32, (a boda boda rider), Hussein Wasswa, 22, (a hawker), Muzamiru Ssali, 27, (boda boda rider), Hajara Nakandi, 35 (a teacher), Abubaker Kyewolwa, 30, (a businessman), Mahad Kasalita (an Imam at Usafi Mosque), Hassan Kato Miiro, 22, and Ismail Bukenya (businessman). All except Pato are on remand.They are charged with two counts which include kidnap with intent to procure a ransom and murder, both contrary to sections of the Penal Code Act. Police said Pato has been able to access his lawyers, but Mr Evans Ochieng, who is representing him, yesterday said he had not met him. I am going to meet him tomorrow,  Mr Ochieng said. ExaminationPolice said the audio recording of the kidnapper is of Pato and they are to subject him to test and examine to establish whether they both match. Apart from a video footage of Pato passing through the airport, he is implicated by phone call exchanges between two other suspects Bob Kibirango and Ronald Asiimwe also known as Kanyankole. Kibirango and Kanyankole were dropped from the list of suspects in April 2018 and as the investigating started pursuing a different line of investigations.Suzan Magara was kidnapped on February 7, 2018, on Kabaka Anjagala Road as she was driving to her home in Lungujja.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/New-details-key-suspect-Magara-murder-emerge/688334-5119110-wc3qt4z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post6.png
7,Ex-Kenyan President Moi to pay KSh1bn fine for land grab - Daily Monitor,"On September 21, 1983, former President Daniel arap Moi forcibly took over a 53-acre piece of land owned by ex-chief Noah Kipngeny Chelugui through a scheme that involved ordering lands officials to make the necessary transfers to register the property, and then, 24 years later, he sold it to a firm owned by the Jaswant Rai family.PRIME PROPERTYThen all went quiet until last week, when the High Court in Eldoret ruled that the former President s move was illegal and ordered both Mr Moi and Rai Plywood (K) Limited to pay Mr Chelugui s family KSh1 billion   the current market value of the prime property.Rai Plywood has occupied the land since 2007   two years after Mr Chelugui died   and has been using it to grow wheat.The firm told High Court judge Antony Ombwayo that it bought the land from Mr Moi in 2007 after doing a thorough search that showed there was no claim to the prime property by anyone other than the former President.Mr Chelugui s 85-year-old wife Susan and son David sued Mr Moi, Rai Plywood, the District Land Registrar, Uasin Gishu District, the Registrar of Titles and the National Land Commission in 2014.The District Lands Registrar and Uasin Gishu District opposed a demand for damages from them, arguing that they were  bound by orders from above by the first respondent (Mr Moi)  in the land-grab scheme.Mr Moi furnished the court with a title deed and white card but was unable to provide any proof of how he bought the land.DISPOSSESSEDThe former President and Rai Plywood insisted that the suit was a claim for land veiled as a constitutional petition. Had the case been treated purely as a land case, it would have been time-barred because Kenya s laws provide a 12-year window to sue for such a claim. With constitutional petitions, however, a judge can overlook the time taken to bring the matter to court. Justice Ombwayo noted that the nature of the people involved   high-ranking government bureaucrats on instruction from the President   made it necessary to accept the suit as a constitutional petition. There is no iota of evidence as to how the former President was registered as the proprietor of the suit land, which was part of (property) that belonged to Noah Kimngeny Chelugui. The state counsel stated that these were orders from above by the first defendant, who was the President (Moi),  said the judge. The court finds that the statement borders on illegality, impunity and procedural impropriety. This court cannot protect property that was acquired through impropriety. In January 1982, Director of Surveys Henry Wambua received verbal instructions from then State House Comptroller Abraham Kiptanui ordering him to assess the property. Mr Wambua complied and informed the Commissioner of Lands, named in court documents as W S Maithukia.Justice Ombwayo held that the letter from Mr Wambua was evidence of interference by State House, which led to the land being subdivided unprocedurally and ending up in Mr Moi s name. This court finds that the petitioners were illegally dispossessed of the suit land,  noted the judge.  Though cancellation of the title is an available remedy, the appropriate remedy is compensation in terms of the value of the land without improvements as the respondents have heavily invested on it and have been in possession for a long period of time.WHITE SETTLER The parcel of land is occupied by entities who are not recognised by the owners. At the time of inspection, the parcel of land was largely not developed but had a portion developed with a petrol station  . However, I find evidence that the property is prime within the municipality of Eldoret and along Uganda Road, and therefore KSh1,060,000,000 is a commensurate compensation to the petitioners. The property only housed a Kobil petrol station at the time Mr Moi took possession in 1983.The judge, however, declined to award the Chelugui family compensation for the profits they would have reaped had they developed the land or used it to transact business.The Cheluguis  lawyer, Mr William Arusei, told Justice Ombwayo that the land was initially part of a 3,300-acre piece of land owned by a white settler named Jacob Hendrik EngelBrecht. Mr Chelugui teamed up with Nathaniel Kiptalam Langat, Thomas Kipkosgei Yator, Cherop Arap Maritim and William Kimngeny Letting to buy Mr EngelBrecht s land in 1965.The property was first registered in Mr Moi s name on September 21, 1983, and the court observed that Mr Moi was not a member of N K Langat & Partners, the original owner of the land that was subdivided into six portions.Experts hired by the Chelugui family had placed the value of the land at Sh1.71 billion and put loss of potential profits at KSh244 million. The Uasin Gishu s valuer had pegged the land at KSh820 million.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Ex-Kenyan-President-Moi-pay-KSh1bn-fine-land-grab/688334-5119478-rg7sxr/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post7.png
8,"Uganda pays Shs1b for marijuana seeds, soils - Daily Monitor","Kampala. As Cabinet debates the health and financial merits of marijuana, it has emerged that Uganda has been importing tonnes of fertilised weed seeds and potting soils, worth billions of shillings.  At least five containers of potting soils (150 tonnes) and cannabis seeds (2,000kgs) entered the country last year from various seed banks of Netherlands and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, an island country in South Asia. Daily Monitor has seen a copy of the invoices for the importation of marijuana seeds that also bear a stamp of the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) dated August 30, 2018. The invoice was issued on August 24, 2018 by one of the marijuana seed banks from Netherlands and contains at least nine types of cannabis seeds. Some of the cannabis seeds imported into the country last year with clearance from URA and ministry of Agriculture are Desfr n, Durban Poison, Frisian Dew, Mazar, Power Plant, Shaman, BULK-CBD Auto Charlotte s Angel, Phyto Sanitary certificate and postage. The company paid Euros38,000 (about Shs160m) for the seeds. Industrial Hemp Uganda Ltd, a private company based in Hima, Kasese District, has been working with Industrial Globus Pharma Uganda Ltd, a subsidiary of Together Pharma from Israel to import marijuana seeds and soils into the country. Potting soilThe company has imported mildly fertilised potting soil or a seed starter from Sri Lanka to a tune of $300,000 (about Shs1.12 billion). This type of soil has a pH [a scale used to specify how acidic or basic a water-based solution] of about 6. This type of soil will have spores and mineral that help young marijuana plants thrive.Asked what is wrong with Uganda soils and whether government cleared his company to import cannabis seeds and soils, Mr Benjamin Cadet, one of the directors at Industrial Hemp (U) Ltd, said:  For medical purposes, we cannot take risks, you need to control everything. These are World Health Organisation protocols for growing and manufacture plan materials for medicinal purposes.  He declined to provide further details. Industrial Hemp (U) Ltd, founded and legally incorporated in 2012, is currently growing and processing medical cannabis. The company has a licence and is currently supervised by the ministries of Health and Internal Affairs, and the National Drug Authority. Heath minister Jane Ruth Aceng is yet to issue letters of no objection to 24 new applicants waiting to join the business under the Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act 2016. The minister had requested Cabinet to guide on the number of companies to be cleared to grow marijuana for medical purposes even when the law does provide for such consultations. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 2016 allows cultivation, production and exportation of medical marijuana and mandates the minister to issue written consent for medical marijuana. However, Dr Aceng insists the applications will have to wait for the final decision of Cabinet. A Cabinet sub-committee put in place by the President was tasked to study the health and financial benefits of medical marijuana. The committee has, however, not reported back to Cabinet even as companies mount pressure on the Health minister to explain the delays. Mandate. Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the Health ministerHowever, sources in the Health ministry told Daily Monitor that the committee members rejected monopoly of Industrial Hemp (U) Ltd and demanded that more companies be licensed to engage in the business after government has put in place regulations and other safeguards to forestall abuse. Ready for exportAfter importing cannabis seeds and potting soils, Industrial Hemp (U) Ltd is in the process of exporting medical marijuana to Canada and Germany to a tune of Shs600b. The marijuana exports from the company farm in Kasese include Cannabinol (CBD) and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with mixture of 2.7mg THC and 2.5mg CBD for Sativex drugs approved in USA, Europe and Canada. Oil Risin contain Dronabinol for making Marinol and syndros capsules and CBD enriched creams for various skin disorders.Daily Monitor understands that the importation of 2,000kgs of cannabis seeds and 150 tonnes of fertilised potting soils was authorised by officials in the ministry of Agriculture. The authority to plant marijuana was given by former Agriculture minister Tress Bucyanayandi and the importation of cannabis seeds and potting soils was secured through what sources in the ministry called  bureaucratic processes . Although Agriculture minister Vincent Ssempijja said he was too busy to explain why his ministry authorised the importation of cannabis seeds and potting soils, sources in the Ministry of Health told Daily Monitor that there are also plans to import marijuana seeds from Germany, another country dominating the international cannabis export market. Although the documents show the taxes on the 2,000kgs of imported cannabis seeds were duly paid to tax authority, Mr Dicksons Kateshumbwa, the URA commissioner for customs, yesterday said he was not aware of the imported items and needed time to verify the documents.  In the country s nascent medical marijuana sector, Israelis provide all the greenhouse infrastructure, security systems and the technology. However, the pharmaceutical manufacturing technology was imported from Germany. Some of the marijuana companies Licensed1. Industrial Hemp (U) Ltd2. Together Pharma Ltd Pending licence3.

9,Kenya's Chief Justice opposes criminalising teen sex - Daily Monitor,"The Kenyan criminal justice system is biased against the boy-child in issues of sexual offences at a time when gender-based violence cases are on the rise, Chief Justice David Maraga has said.The CJ made the remarks during the launch of a two-day peer learning seminar on criminal justice system on gender-based violence.He said the issue has been exacerbated by gaps in the criminal justice system and expressed dissatisfaction in the manner in which a bill to decriminalise teenage sex was handled in Parliament. There is an obvious injustice of filling up the jails with teenage offenders who get intimate with fellow teenagers as they experiment in their adolescence,  Mr Maraga said.He explained how the Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) tried to address the issue by presenting a memorandum on the bill which proposed amendment on the Sexual Offences Act in the National Assembly two years ago but in vain. The proposal was intended to clarify principles of law and to incorporate values and principals as enshrined in the Constitution of Kenya 2010. Fida had noted the problematic Section Eight of the Sexual Offences Act, which criminalises sex among teenagers, and had proposed that the section be amended along the Romeo and Juliet right so as to reduce the number of teenage boys going to jail,  Mr Maraga said.Fida wanted the courts to have the discretion in sentencing where sexual offences are between minors, he said, but the bill was shot down.This needs to be seriously thought about, the CJ said.Mr Maraga lauded the Court of Appeal for setting a precedent in one of the cases. Luckily, our courts are responding appropriately, for example when the Court of Appeal held that it is unconstitutional to criminalise sexual acts among teenagers,  he said.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kenya-s-Chief-Justice-opposes-criminalising-teen-sex/688334-5119634-a3oxum/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post9.png

12,Israel asks Uganda to open embassy in Jerusalem - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. The Israelis on Thursday appealed to government of Uganda to open an embassy in their country to ease trade and promote tourism.Speaking at a prayer breakfast in Kampala, the Israel Deputy Ambassador to Kenya Mr David Eyal asked Christians to pray for them as they battle with their  enemies . He said they have been supporting Uganda in areas of education, agriculture and security and hoped their meeting yesterday would boost future collaboration. It is not easy to be there in the Middle East surrounded by enemies. They want to destroy us. With all the enemies that want to destroy us, we are stronger with you and we appreciate it. Our hope is not lost. I invite you all to come to Jerusalem in the holy land to walk in the path of Jesus. We have a strong army,  Mr Eyal said.The First Lady, Ms Janet Museveni then invited the guests at the prayer breakfast at Hotel Africana to stand with her and prayed against violence and fear in Israel and restoration of peace.  We pray for your Holy Spirit to convict us all about sin, righteousness and the judgment to come so that we will work for truth and forgiveness in the Lord Jesus, and always strive to find peace through your son Jesus Christ. We ask that the destructive plans of the enemy be brought to nothing, and that your perfect plan may quickly come to pass. We pray for the Jewish and Arab believers in Jerusalem to come together and truly love one another,  Ms Museveni who doubles as education minister prayed. Mr Robert Llatore, co-chair Jerusalem prayer breakfast said their intercessions had started yielding fruits after United States of America President Donald Trump recognised that Jerusalem was Israel s city at their 70th independence anniversary.  I want to declare this morning that if Uganda will take a step and open an embassy in Jerusalem not one man will get to say we don t have a budget to open an embassy in Uganda. Pray for peace of Jerusalem the opening of embassy in Jerusalem is important to us in Israel and for Uganda if it dawns on us that the embassy is opened, may the blessings follow you, the opening of the embassy will lead to good cooperation in economic, security, technological and spiritual fields,  Mr Llatore said.In a separate interview yesterday, the State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Okello Oryem, said they consider Israel as a close ally and that they worked closely in agriculture and security and that there have been assurances to put the embassy in Israel. We have already given assurance to Israel when Prime Minister Netanyahu was here that government would open an embassy in Israel. It is among our priorities although I don t know when this will materialise,  Mr Oryem said on phone. Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Uganda in 2016. Mr Eyal said they have increased the number of students they have been sponsoring from Uganda to train in agriculture in Israel from 200 to 240 this year.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Israel-asks-Uganda-open-embassy-Jerusalem/688334-5119218-mk98nxz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post16.png
13,How prepared are we in case of fire outbreaks  - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. When President Museveni invited a German company to set up a fire brigade station in Uganda, his remark raised questions why government should be looking to a private company to provide fire-fighting services, which is the mandate of the Uganda Police Force.The President made the proposal while meeting Mr Hans-Georg Hinterberger, the country representative of the German company Achelis Uganda Limited, at State House in Kampala. He asked the company to  consider partnering with Uganda Police Force to make a fire wing in Uganda Police Force  to provide fire brigade training and equipment, which the police critically lack or are short of.In an interview with Daily Monitor, the director of the police Fire Prevention and Rescue Services, Mr Joseph Mugisa, said they have only 650 personnel and 98 fire-fighting trucks in 46 stations thinly spread across the country to serve the 40 million population and more than 300 urban centres that have a high fire risk. This compares miserably with the directorate s requirement of at least 1,000 personnel and about 200 trucks and stations. We think if we have 206 trucks and stations, these would be sufficient to respond to all emergencies across the country,  Mr Mugisa said. For fire-fighting we are 650, manning 46 fire stations countrywide. We have minimum numbers based on the equipment and classes of fire trucks available. We are still small but our plan is to grow and cover the whole country. There are so many gaps remaining to be covered. We would love to be in every major town of this country,  he added.Mr Mugisa supported the President s proposal to have a private investor provide fire emergency and rescue services to supplement the police. He said the private players would help to train Ugandan police within the country other than sending them abroad.He said the proposal would mitigate the shortage of capacity in fire fighting services in the police and save the government the high costs of setting up such facilities. He said the invitation to the German company is welcome because local private companies have not shown interest in providing such services. Where are they  Basically we don t have such private players here. I recently attended a meeting at the State House where this private German company expressed interest and they could be the only one. So we need them to come in and we work as a team,  Mr Mugisa said.He said the shortage of fire brigade capacity is enormous and requires urgent redress.Mr Mugisa said in Kampala Metropolitan area, the problem is compounded by heavy traffic, narrow roads and congested structures which slow the mobility of the police fire brigade trucks. He said in up-country areas, the long distances between different fire stations make the problem more complex.In many past fire accidents, it took police fire fighters several hours to arrive at the scene often after irreversible losses of property and life have occurred.For example, for the 2018 fire at St Bernard Secondary School, Manya in Rakai District that claimed lives of 11 students, it took the police fire brigade over two hours to arrive at the scene. The residents said a lot could have been saved if the police fire squad had intervened in time.In Jinja District, when fire gutted Kiira radio station, residents blamed police fire fighters for delaying to arrive. A similar case was reported at Makerere University Business School Nakawa in May last year when a hostel caught fire and it took long for police to respond to the emergency. Even when they arrived, they were ill-equipped for the task.While the number of urban centres and population has increased, there has not been corresponding growth in fire-fighting stations with the required equipment and personnel.Mr Mugisa said the police need at least 1,000 fire personnel to provide an effective and prompt response to a fire outbreak. He said police are supposed to respond to a fire accident within 3-15 minutes from the time of the outbreak.Most cars and trucks have a speed limit of between 50km/h to 80km/h, meaning that fire fighting engines are supposed to be within a range of about 20km apart to effectively respond to fire emergencies.Mr Mugisa said while the standard response time is between 3 and 15 minutes, many times police even take hours to reach the scene because they are thinly spread, constrained by long distances to the scene and heavy traffic along the way. If we talk about effectiveness, we need more personnel, more fire stations and equipment. Look at our highways; the stations are far apart yet for fire emergencies, we need maximum of 15 minutes response. Otherwise you will get there when everything is completely destroyed,  he said.According to Mr Mugisa, all municipalities, urban centres and highways are supposed to have a fire station each. Currently Uganda has 41 municipalities and about 180 town councils. All these need fire fighting equipment and growth of urbanisation. The moment you see increased activity in an area, then you expect an increase in the risk of fire or other emergencies occurring. Along our highways, we expect emergencies to occur and they do occur. For instance, we have a station at Luweero, but its coverage is too big yet it is a very busy highway. We need more of those facilities along all our highways if we are to be very effective in handling the fire emergencies,  he said.ConcentrationCurrently, almost half of the fire stations and trucks in the country are within Kampala Metropolitan area and the other half are in the old districts. For Kampala, we are spread out in quite a number of places. We have more than 200 personnel to manage the metropolitan area of Kampala,  Mr Mugisa said.Fire stations within Kampala metropolitan area include the headquarters at Clock Tower, Kololo, Wandegeya, Bweyogerere, Namanve, Mukono, Entebbe, Kajjanzi, Kabalagala, Kawempe, Nansana, Nateete, Kira and Wakiso.Mr Mugisa said police receive daily fire emergency requests from different parts of the city and surrounding areas. The emergencies include road accidents, fire outbreaks and drowning, among others. Our officers do not rest, we are always on the move. That s why to respond very fast, we have to spread out our facilities. We need to expand the facilities more to cover the metropolitan area,  he said. Outside Kampala metropolitan area, other districts that have fire stations include Arua, which serves West Nile sub-region, Gulu and Kitgum for Acholi, Lira for Lango and Moroto for Karamoja.Others are Mbarara, Kabale, Fort Portal, Masaka, Jinja, Iganga, Hoima, Masindi, Mbale, Luweero, Kisoro, Kirywandongo and Tororo.However, Mr Mugisa noted that on average, each of the above fire stations serves between three to five districts, which are far away from each other and the situation is getting worse with creation of new districts.Past fire incidentsBudo.  In 2008, the country woke up to the horror, that would leave parents, pupils, school management and Ugandans perplexed when Budo Junior caught fire, killing 19 pupils. By the time the fire fighters reached, irreversible damage had been done, loss of human lives and school buildings in ruins.In 2015, a report by the Directorate of Police Fire Prevention and Rescue Services indicated that the country was losing up to Shs30b annually to fire accidents and said the situation was likely to worsen with the country s rapid population growth and urbanisation.A total of 1,099 fire emergencies were handled in 2017 compared to 1,356 in 2016 giving a 19 per cent decrease.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/How-prepared-we-case-of-fire-outbreaks/688334-5119152-b2gh8t/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post17.png
14,Teachers insist on strike ahead of term - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Teachers under their umbrella association yesterday maintained their position to go on strike on Monday when schools officially open for the second term if government does not respond to their salary enhancement demands. Mr Filbert Baguma, Uganda National Teachers  Union (Unatu) general secretary told Daily Monitor that they have sought audience in all offices since they issued a notice to government in February but they have not received any response.  The industrial action is on. We have four days left. We had an agreement with government,  Mr Baguma said. The ultimatum expires on Monday when the school calendar opens for second term.Mr Patrick Muinda, the Ministry of Education spokesperson, said they had not received any information from the teachers on the industrial action. We have never received any ultimatum from teachers,  he said. On February 20, the teachers put government on a 90-day notice that they would lay down their tools unless they received positive response on salary increment.Earlier this month, they accused government of double standards. It is unfortunate teachers  issues have turned into a song on auto reply. Almost every financial year, teachers remind government about commitments earlier made. Do teachers really matter in this nation  Are commitments made by government mere boardroom gimmicks meant to silence teachers   Mr Baguma asked.He said the proposed salary increment for public servants will further deepen the salary inequality which will make supervision of teachers difficult and undermine delivery of quality education.While presenting the ministry s achievements in the past three years at the Prime Minister s office on Monday, Education minister Janet Museveni acknowledged that salaries for primary school teachers had not been increased for three consecutive years. There has been no salary enhancement for primary school teachers in the last three years because increment prior to Financial Year 2016/17 put them above the pay targets in the pay policy approved by Cabinet,  Ms Museveni said. She said the monthly salary for Grade III teachers had increased from Shs280,000 to Shs469,355. Resolution The teachers  leadership countrywide has today (yesterday) resolved to enter into an industrial action effective May 20 if there is no satisfactory feedback on issues pertaining to teachers  salary increment for 2019/2020. Notification was given to government in February expressing our intention to go on industrial action. Regrettably, no response has been received from government to date,  Unatu.Background The teachers negotiated their salary increment in 2011 following a sit-down strike that paralysed all public schools. The government team headed by the then prime minister, Mr Amama Mbabazi, promised a phased increment in three consecutive financial years. However, to date, the teachers are still asking government to fulfil this promise.

15,Government to borrow Shs1.7 trillion for oil roads - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The government has presented to Parliament a loan request of $456.37m (Shs1.7 trillion) to fund the upgrade and construction of national oil roads.The request presented Thursday by the Minister of State for Planning, Mr David Bahati, is to be obtained from China Exim Bank.Once approved, the money will see the construction of roads under package 1, 2 and 3, covering a total stretch of 363 kilometres.The total contract sum for the three packages is $536.92m (Shs2.02 trillion).The deputy Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Oulanyah, referred the matter to the House Committee on National Economy for scrutiny and recommendations.The committee is expected to report back within a period of 45 days.In the proposal, the government premises its request on the projection of having its first commercial oil available by 2020. In order to achieve this target, key enabling infrastructure, such as road network, must be in place,  reads in part the letter addressed to the Speaker.The total projection for oil roads is 700 kms.In March, government signed a contract with China Railway Seventh Group to design and construct a 97 km road connecting Masindi-Biso, Kabaale-Kizirafumdi and Hohwa-Nyairongo-Kyarushesha-Butole.Mr Mark Sali, the head of public and corporate affairs at the Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra), said:  The benefit of the loan is that Unra will be able to finance the construction of these roads quickly and get them ready to facilitate oil production.  If Parliament approves the loan, government will only be left with three packages; 4, 5 and 6, which cover a total of 301 kms.Beneficiary roadsPackage (1) includes the  design and construction of Masindi (Kisanja)-Park Junction and Tangi (Pakwach) junction-Paraa-Buliisa and Wanseko-Bugungu roads upgrading projects, measuring about 159 kms.

17,South Sudan sacks 40 overseas diplomats for going AWOL - Daily Monitor,"South Sudan said Thursday it had sacked 40 overseas diplomats for not showing up for work, some of them for years.The foreign ministry in Juba said it had tried in vain ""to engage with these diplomats who went Absent Without Appointed Leave (AWOL) over the past few months and years"", including some posted to embassies in the United States and United Kingdom.None had replied or returned home after finishing their postings -- prompting their mass firing in a terse memo issued by the foreign ministry.""Unfortunately the ministry was left with no choice but to let these diplomats go, following fruitless attempts to convince these diplomats to return to work in Juba,"" the ministry said in a statement Wednesday.Foreign ministry spokesman Mawien Makol told AFP Thursday that the whereabouts of the absconding emissaries -- whose full names were printed in a table entitled ""Dismissed/Terminated Diplomat"" -- remained unclear.Those listed have been removed from the payroll and formally discharged of duty effective immediately, and instructed to return their diplomatic passports and those of their family members to the nearest South Sudan mission.Some had been posted to embassies in Uganda and Kenya, said Makol.The statement cited South Sudan's Diplomatic and Consular Act of 2011: ""Absence from work for consecutive forty-five (45) days without permission, shall be considered a resignation.""Makol dismissed suggestions the firings were a cost-saving exercise for South Sudan's cash-strapped government.Juba had closed a number of missions abroad in recent years, and staff in some embassies have complained of pay cheques being delayed.""It is just a normal procedure and it has nothing to do with economic challenges,"" Makol said.South Sudan, the world's youngest country, plunged into conflict in 2013, only two years after achieving independence.The war has left 380,000 people dead and forced more than four million South Sudanese -- almost a third of the population -- to flee their homes.A peace deal signed in September 2018 has largely stopped fighting, but implementation has run aground and the planned formation of a unity government on May 12 was postponed for six months.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/South-Sudan-sacks-40-overseas-diplomats-going-AWOL/688340-5119196-nswglgz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post21.png
18,Two families claiming part of Namboole land - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Two families are claiming part of the Mandela National Stadium, Namboole, land that government acquired in 1989 under statutory instrument 23 of 1989. The family of the late Thomas Bazitya and Celestino Kitakka yesterday told the Commission of Inquiry into Land Matters that they were not compensated.Mr Makayi Bazitya, one of the claimants, showed the probe a special title acquired in 2017 while Ms Norah Nabagesera, the 80-year-old widow of Kitakka, presented a copy of her 16-acre title registered in 1982. The disputed land is located next to Bweyogerere Police Station and Bweyogerere market. However, Justice Catherine Bamugemereire, the head of the probe team, dismissed the claim by the late Bazitya s family, saying their special title had been acquired on government land.  I wonder why a government official or [the one who] surveyed this land gave the Bazitya family a special title without telling them that it was government land,  she said.Justice Bamugemereire promised to investigate the claims by both families, but added that where the commission finds acts of criminality, the law would take its course. Justice Bamugemereire was touring the stadium to assess the level of encroachment on the land by several individuals and companies. During the tour, Mr Charles Ekolong, the former principal government valuer, said Ms Nabagesera had been compensated for her land on Block 234 Plot 263 that the family claimed was outside stadium land while the Bazitya family handed over their title to government. On Wednesday, Mandela National Stadium Limited petitioned the land probe to help them get a title on their 120-acre piece of land and also help them get rid of encroachers. Mr Jamil Ssewanyana, the managing director of the company, showed Justice Bamugemereire structures that individuals and companies have built on the land. Some of the encroachers include Bweyogerere Market, Bweyogerere Police Station, part of Sports View Hotel and Kirekka Veterans. Justice Bamugemereire advised the Mayor Kiira Town Council to build a market for sports equipment to match with the stadium.The stadium management has only utilised half of the 120 acres of the land.Mr Ssewanyana said some encroachers were threatening the future of sports development in the country.  My Lord, anytime I might receive a special title with someone claiming the pitch,  he said.  We have a security team to monitor our land and ensure no new encroachers. We have broken some houses, sometimes when we report to police, we are not helped. The last time we arrested some people, they were released,  he added.Mr Ssewanyana wants to build an Olympic size swimming pool and a gymnasium to promote other sports. He also said the stadium is expecting a team from China who want to build the two facilities. Government bought 103 plots on Kyadondo Block 232 and Block 234 to build a stadium in 1989. Several people were compensated but some claim they were not paid.

19,We will meet 2021 roads target - Works minister - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Government has said its on course to meet its plan of constructing more than 2,000 kilometres of roads by 2021. During the presentation of the manifesto implementation progress report at the Office of Prime Minister yesterday, the Minister of Works and Transport, Ms Monica Azuba Ntege, said in the last three years, 632.1 kms of roads were completed, with additional 382 kms under construction, expected to be completed by the end of this year. 382km of paved network will be completed; when added to the 632.1km, it will result into 1.014km. This will represent 46 per cent of the manifesto target of 2,295 kms,  Ms Azuba said.She also said the contracts for another 308 kms of road works have been signed and works have started.Government budgetFigures from the Ministry of Works and Transport indicate that government had budgeted a total of Shs37 trillion for the ministry for five years. This, according to the ministry, would cater for road, air, railway and inland water transport.Road sector took the lion s share of Shs19.3 trillion, followed by the railway at about Shs12 trillion, followed by air transport at Shs5 trillion and inland water transport trailing at Shs727 billion. Officials from the ministry say only Shs22.6 trillion is available to rollout the construction works, leaving a funding gap of Shs14.4 billion, which the government is struggling to get.The ministry says the design of 25 roads have been completed while another 20 are being designed. Ms Azuba said:  Under the rehabilitation of the old roads, a total of 428.5 kms have been completed, while 341kms are under repairs. Thus, a total of 769 kms of the national road network will be rehabilitated in the first four years of the manifesto period against the target of 700km.  Regarding the air transport sector, the minister was grateful with the revival of Uganda airlines. Already two planes are in the country and another two are expected in July and September.With this, Ms Azuba said Uganda is on the course to make Entebbe Airport a regional hub and make Uganda a cheaper travel destination.She said the upgrades at Entebbe airport are expected to accommodate the increasing air traffic. Ms Azuba expects the construction works to be completed by 2020/2021.The minister also said Kabale airport construction work is progressing, with 35 per cent of physical work already complete. She said this and other regional airfields will offer more efficient and cheaper air transport.However, Minister Azuba said while her ministry has performed well over a period of time, inadequate funding by the government is delaying several projects, with some including Bukasa port, Tororo-Gulu railway line and a number of national roads.Government s PlanConstruction. Under the road sector, government had planned to tarmac a total of 2,205 kms of roads, rehabilitate 700 kms of old paved roads, construct expressways within the greater Kampala metropolitan area and construct 112 bridges across the country. It also planned to procure 1,152 road maintenance equipment, maintain 2,500 kms of paved roads and 10,000 kms of unpaved roads.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/We-will-meet-2021-roads-target-Works-minister/688334-5119068-11vw7ojz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post23.png

The proprietor of Fang Fang Hotel in Kampala has asked court to order Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group Limited, a phosphate firm in Tororo District, to pay her $25m (Shs94.2b) as compensation for loss of her business interest.Ms Fang Min accuses her former partner, Mr LV Weidong, the proprietor of Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group, of alleged fraudulent acquisition of a multi-million dollar minerals deposit at Osukuru Hills in Tororo.He is jointly sued with Mr Mao Jie and Mr Yang Junjia over alleged fraudulent and unlawful expropriation of 26 square-kilometre mineral site. Other parties accused include Uganda Hui Neng Mining Limited. In her submissions before the Commercial Division of the High Court yesterday, Ms Min asked for general damages and exemplary damages to cater for her shares in the assets of Uganda Hui Neng Mining, which were illegally transferred to Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group Limited.SubmissionMr Ebert Byenkya, the plaintiff s lawyer, said the claim is the valuation of his client as per the 2018 expert valuation report that shows that the value of her shares increased. The meeting that made the resolution for the transfer of the assets and mineral exploration licences at Osukuru was illegal. The asset was substantial but no approval was granted and Mr LV Weidong owns and controls 100 per cent of the entire business as per evidence,  Mr Byenkya said.He also invited the court to assess Mr LV Weidong s conduct in the transaction which involved filing forged documents presented as well as making Mr Jie and Mr Junjia to sign as directors yet they are not subscribers nor paid up directors as required by law.Mr Byenkya said the resolution that formed the basis for transfer of the shares was made without the knowledge and consent of Ms Min, who owned 35 per cent shares in the initial company.Presiding judge David Wangutusi extended the hearing of the case to May 21.ProbedLast month, Mr LV Weidong was quizzed over fraudulent conduct in the acquisition of a multimillion dollar minerals deposit at Osukulu Hills.

Two businessmen have been remanded to Luzira prison for allegedly impersonating as investigators attached to State House Anti-Corruption Unit.Mubaraka Bulo of Iganga District and Kasim Lasibu, a mobile money agent in Jinja, were yesterday arraigned before the Anti-Corruption Court at Kololo over charges of corruption.They denied charges of obtaining money by false pretence and impersonation before Grade One Magistrate Sarah Namusobya. She remanded the suspects because the sureties they presented did not meet the required standard. The sureties presented have not demonstrated the ability to meet the high recognisance. Bail is therefore denied,  Ms Namusobya ruled before advising the duo to find the right people to stand for them.ComplaintThe State House Anti-Corruption Unit headed by Lt Col Edith Nakalema arrested Lasibu and Bulo last week following reports by several public officials accusing them of demanding money from them. Prosecution alleges that on May 9 at Victoria Nile Primary School in Jinja Municipality, Lasibu and Bulo falsely presented themselves as CID investigators attached to the State House Anti-Corruption Unit in Kampala and assumed to carry out an investigation involving the head teacher, Ms Harriet Gandi.The State contends that the duo, with intent to defraud, obtained Shs1.39m from Ms Gandi pretending that they were investigating a case in which she was involved in whereas not. Meanwhile, a State attorney, who was arrested for allegedly soliciting a Shs6 million bribe, will be arraigned before the same court today.

22,"Parliament passes Roads Bill, rejects reserve expansion - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Parliament Thursday passed the Roads Bill 2018 but rejected the proposal by government to expand a road reserve from the current 30 metres to 80 metres. In the Bill, the government had proposed to extend the current road reserve of 15 metres on either side of middle of road to 40 metres. The government also sought to give the Minister of Works and Transport powers for compulsory acquisition of people s land to create a road reserve without prior compensation.However, Parliament rejected the proposals and amended Clause 14(1) of the Bill which provided that government shall only declare a person s land a road reserve after due compensation has been paid in accordance with Article 26 of the Constitution.The Roads Bill 2018 was introduced to repeal and replace the Roads Act Cap 358 and the Access to Roads Act Cap 350 of 1959 to improve management of roads in the country.During the debate on the Bill on Tuesday, government proposed introduction of a new schedule to specify the width of road reserve depending on different classes of roads.However, when the Bill was called to the floor of Parliament yesterday, there was no government official to present the proposal to introduce the schedule. In the end, the Deputy Speaker, Mr Jacob Oulanyah, ruled that the Bill be passed without the introduction of the schedule specifying the proposed different widths of road reserves. A new schedule was proposed by the Chair (of the Committee) immediately after schedule two. If there is nobody to propose it, then there is no new schedule,  Mr Oulanyah ruled. This means government lost out on the plan to extend the road reserve. This was one of the contentious parts of the Bill because some of the members during the debate had feared that if the road reserve width on both sides of middle of road take a total of 80 metres, the people have developments along the existing roads would be affected. The movers of the minority report Works Minister Monica Azuba Ntege, Mr Robert Kafeero Ssekitoleko (Nakifuma County), the committee chair, Mr Jonathan Odur (Erute South) and Mr Richard Othieno Okoth (West Budama North), and Shadow Works minister William Nzoghu surfaced about 10 minutes after the House had passed the Bill.Mr Ssekitoleko told Daily Monitor after the plenary session that at the time the Bill was passed, they were finalising harmonisation of the specification for the road reserve width as ordered by Mr Oulanyah on Tuesday. The minister, myself, the engineer in chief (Mr Samson Bagonza) and four other members, we were in a harmonisation meeting in my office and we had made proposals of win-win to reduce but the Speaker did not give us time. But we have no problem,  he said.ImpactMr Ssekitoleko said government is now free to construct smaller roads passing through urban centres, rocky and mountainous places where it cannot manage to acquire enough land for a road reserve since the law has maintained the original measurements of 15 metres from centre of the road to either side.Mr Odur welcomed the new Act, saying the Ugandans are the winners because their land remains safe from forceful takeover by government through declaration of road reserve by the minister before full acquisition. It is a score on our side because our proposal in Clause 14(1) was to give government powers to declare a road reserve on a piece of land it has fully acquired not the other way round where the minister was supposed to be given powers to do so prior to acquisition,  he said.Mr Nzoghu said the two sides had also failed to agree on the 30 metres that government side had come up with to reduce from the proposed 40 metres. For our side, we insisted on at least 20 metres for highways, which are national roads and 15 metres for local government roads. But we were bringing these proposals to the House,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Parliament-passes-Roads-Bill-rejects-reserve-expansion/688334-5119156-rnhucl/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post26.png
23,Stigma to blame for high HIV/Aids deaths - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The continued stigma against people living with HIV/aids is responsible for high numbers of the scourge-related deaths despite the introduction of antiretroviral therapy drugs that enable patients to live longer and normally, a senior specialists has said.Dr Nelson Musooba, the director general of Uganda Aids Commission, the national organisation which oversees the strategy to combat HIV/Aids in the country, said as a result, many people seek treatment late when their immunity has already weakened. Sometimes you have TB and cancers because there are very many cancers and the opportunistic infections that come with HIV. So it starts with stigma, they [patients] don t seek treatment on time, sometime they are taking half of the treatment or not on time,  Dr Musooba said.  We have about 25,000 related deaths every year as of 2018 but there has been massive reduction for both new infections and Aids related deaths. We have seen a 50 per cent reduction between 2010 and now. In 2010, we had more than 100,000 new infections but now, you can see the reduction at 50,000,  he said.An updateHe was speaking yesterday at Uganda Media Centre in Kampala during a press conference to give an update on the status of HIV/Aids in the country ahead of the 36th International Candlelight Memorial Day on May 19. The day, which falls every third Sunday of May, is marked to remember friends and family who have been lost to HIV/Aids as well as raise awareness. This year s theme is  Intensifying the Fight for Health and Rights .Dr Musooba also stated that Uganda is on the right track to achieving the 90-90-90 UNAIDS goals to have 90 per cent people in the country know their status, the same percentage of people started on treatment and another 90 per cent having their viral load suppressed by 2020.With only seven months to the deadline, Dr Musooba assured that the country has currently achieved 89-89-90 of the goals respectively, stating that they hope to have hit all the targets.The Minister Without Portfolio, Hajj Abdul Nadduli, rallied especially young people to choose a lifestyle that does not expose them to the risk of HIV infection by avoiding misguided peer pressure until they are ready to enter into sexual relationships.  For adults, you have the power to protect yourself, your spouse, your children and others around you, take an HIV test so you know your status,  Hajj Nadduli cautioned.  Uganda currently has 1.3 million people living with HIV/Aids and has lost an estimated two million people to HIV over the last three decades.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Stigma-to-blame-high-HIV-Aids-deaths/688334-5119124-e2blrr/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post27.png
24,Uganda to fix security radars on border lakes - Daily Monitor,"Masindi. The government plans to set up electronic security systems on all Ugandan lakes shared with other countries, President Museveni has said.While addressing the media at Masindi State Lodge on Wednesday evening, the President said he had learnt about the attacks on Ugandan fishermen by suspected Congolese militia groups. We have a plan to put modern security on that lake. We shall put there surface radars to monitor the entire lake. We shall also register all boats and install in them electronic monitors,  the President said.Mr Museveni said this while responding to a question from the media about steps Uganda is taking to curb constant attacks by suspected Congolese militia groups on Ugandan fishermen, which have left several dead, injured and their fishing gear robbed. It is possible to electronically manage that lake to curb crime. We shall do the same on all lakes that are on the border with other countries,  Mr Museveni said.He said criminal gangs had caused insecurity in Kampala but the vices significantly reduced when CCTV cameras were installed in the city.The issue of territory has been the main cause of misunderstandings on Lake Albert since the lake is shared by the two countries [Uganda and DRC].The President also disclosed that he had initiated funds that will support different specialisations that give Ugandans a livelihood.The funds will, among others, benefit farmers, Saccos, organised groups and a new fund for import substitution and export promotion.Mr Museveni said government is currently supporting commercial agriculture, ICT, industrialisation and the service sectors that are giving a livelihood to majority of Ugandans. Government records indicate that the ICT sector is employing 1.2 million Ugandans; the service sector is employing more than 1.3 million, while 4,900 factories are employing more than 700,000 Ugandans,  he said.The President underscored the importance of environmental conservation and advised Ugandans to avoid encroaching on forests and wetlands. Lake conflicts Ugandan fishermen face constant attacks from suspected Congolese armed groups who have left several dead. In May 2013, three Ugandan fisheries enforcement officials and two police officers were abducted by a group of armed Congolese operatives on Lake Albert.On November 10, 2012, there was a heavy exchange of gunfire on the Lake Albert waters between a Ugandan security team and an armed group believed to be from DR Congo.

25,Mayuge gets Shs14b to fight bilharzia - Daily Monitor,"Mayuge. The government of South Korea has, through World Vision, an evangelical Christian humanitarian aid, development, and advocacy organisation, given $3.8b (Shs14.3b) to Mayuge District to eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).The two-year project, which is funded through Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), is aimed at raising awareness about NTDs such as bilharzia and other parasitic worm diseases.Speaking at the project launch at Mayuge District headquarters on Wednesday, the World Vision eastern region project manager, Mr Fred Opoka, said Mayuge was selected because it has one of the highest prevalence rates of bilharzia and soil transmitted helminths. Scientifically known as schistosomiasis, bilharzia is contracted when blood flukes enter the body by way of contact with infested surface water.The project, that is going to directly benefit 400,000 people, will cover 14 Sub-counties, 512 villages, 446 schools (178,659 school children) and involve 1,074 village health teams (VHTs) across 42 health centres, Mr Opoka said.In 2003, more than 75 per cent of the children on island primary schools in Mayuge District carried germs that cause bilharzia, a health survey conducted by then district director of health services, Mr Peter Naireka, revealed.The survey was conducted on several island schools, including Gori, Jagusi, Selinyabi, Bumba, Kaza, Sagitu and Maslya, where it was discovered that 75 per cent of the pupils had bilharzia. The prevalence of bilharzia and other parasitic worm diseases in Mayuge District stands at 98 per cent and 68 per cent respectively, and it is on that basis that a proposal was developed and funding secured for the project,  Mr Opoka said.The South Korean ambassador to Uganda, Mr Ha Byung-Kyoo, said over the recent years, his government has implemented various projects to enhance health outcomes.Area of focusSome of the projects, he said, include maternal new-born and child health project in Butaleja District, strengthening maternal health throughout the country and improving water and sanitation conditions in Karamoja Sub-region.Over the next three years, the project hopes to have provided quality education and training to health workers, adequate supply of medicine, built public washrooms for sanitation and water storage facilities and clean water pipes.Dr Charles Nabangi, the district health officer, said they have little diagnostic capacity for bilharzia (few facilities to check for the organisms), few health centre IIIs and lack of sensitisation, with a lot of myths and misconceptions from the community who associate bilharzia with witchcraft.The Resident District Commissioner, Mr James Shilaku, however, said two health centre IIs at Busawa and Jaguzi Sub-counties are being elevated to health centre III, and once upgraded, healthcare in the communities will be improved. The project is timely for a  very vulnerable  district like Mayuge whose handwashing and pit-latrine coverage rates stand at 33. 2 per cent and 67.4 per cent respectively,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Mayuge-gets-Shs14b-fight-bilharzia/688334-5118786-k46s4jz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post29.png

27,"Minister Kitutu okays sand mining, rice growing in Lwera - Daily Monitor","KALUNGU. State Minister for Environment Goretti Kitutu has supported the ongoing sand mining and expansion of rice fields in Lwera wetland in Kalungu District, saying the projects are developmental for as long as they were approved by the National Environment Management Authority (Nema). Using wetlands is permitted under the law although many people don t know it. If Lwera is used for sand mining and rice growing, it has no harm if the activities are approved by Nema,  Ms Kitutu said during a telephone interview on Tuesday.Last month, environmentalists under the National Association of Professional Environmentalists, accused individuals and Chinese companies of degrading Lwera wetland while carrying out massive excavation of sand and rice growing. Ms Kitutu said:  I want to allay fears of those who think that what is going on will cause a catastrophe. That is not true. However, a recent visit to Lwera revealed that some sand miners, after carrying out excavations, leave huge open pits behind which are dangerous to the environment while others have turned them into fish ponds. Dr Tom Okurut, the executive director of Nema, said they cleared most of the activities in Lwera, however, they are yet to establish whether the investors are following the guidelines issued.Mr Vincent Ssempijja, the minister of Agriculture, said he was sure Zhong Industries Ltd, which grows rice in Lwera, follows the guidelines government issued.However, civil society activists under Citizens Concern Africa, a non- governmental organisation, says Lwera is not a gazetted industrial park and they are soliciting signatures to petition Parliament over the matter.Mr Peter Li Gan, the managing director, Lukaya Natural Rice Farm, said their rice fields are not in a wetland. Our rice fields are away from the wetland. We are not acquiring new land, we are using the same land we acquired at the start,  he said.Lwera wetlandLwera swamp stretches about 20kms on the Kampala Masaka highway. It is a major water catchment area that connects several rivers and wetlands in Gomba, Mpigi and Kalungu districts and drains directly to Lake Victoria.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Minister-Kitutu-okays-sand-mining-rice-growing-Lwera/688334-5118824-12y9y24/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post31.png
28,Kwania hires services of 2 districts to recruit staff - Daily Monitor,"Kwania. At least two district service commissions have been approved to conduct recruitment of staff in Kwania District.A council meeting held at Kwania District headquarters on Monday unanimously resolved to hire the services of Amolatar and Alebtong district service commissions.The two district service commissions are expected to carry out regularisation of appointment of staff, confirmation and giving acting appointments to staff in a bid to enhance service delivery.Mr Geoffrey Eling Owera, the Kwania District vice chairperson confirmed the development.He said the Ministry of Local Government and Public Service had advised that recruitment of staff should be given priority and be done before May 15.The ministry warned that if that was not done, funds allocated to Kwania to cater for the wage payment would be returned to the Treasury.Kwania District chief administrative officer, Ms Albina Awor, said it was a shame to lead a local government, which had no staff since all staff were brought from the mother district, Apac, to open the newly created administrative unit.Kwania was carved out of Apac and became operational on July 1, 2018.Ms Awor said one district service commission would handle recruitment while the other would carry out regularisation of staff appointment, confirmation and giving acting appointments to staff. We want the two district service commissions because they will perform different duties in order for us to catch up with the financial year, which is just at the corner,  she told Daily Monitor on Tuesday. The recruitmentThe interim district chairperson Basil Okello Onach said the district received Shs2.2 billion from the central government for payment of staff wages.In January, Kwania advertised for 55 positions and more than 2,000 applicants have so far shown interest in those positions.In a council meeting held on March 25, the District Council, however, suspended their recruitment exercise after failing to approve the proposed name of the district service commission to conduct the activity. This came after some councillors protested the proposal presented by the executive saying it was null and void.ReasonKwania District chief administrative officer, Ms Albina Awor, said it was a shame to lead a local government, which had no staff since all staff were brought from the mother district, Apac, to open the newly created administrative unit.Kwania was carved out of Apac and became operational on July 1, 2018.Ms Awor said one district service commission would handle recruitment while the other would carry out regularisation of staff appointment, confirmation and giving acting appointments to staff.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kwania-hires-services-2-districts-recruit-staff/688334-5118840-om2yroz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post32.png
29,Red Cross warns underfunding could hamstring DRC Ebola response - Daily Monitor,"The Red Cross warned Thursday that critical underfunding could force it to cut vital work to rein in the deadly Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo at a time when case numbers are soaring.Without more funds, it would need to begin ""dramatically"" scaling back its operations within two weeks, Emanuele Capobianco, health director of the International Federation of the Red Cross told reporters in Geneva.The organisation leads efforts to safely bury victims of the disease, which spreads through contact with blood and other bodily fluids.""The situation is serious,"" said Capobianco. More than 1,100 people have died since the central African country last August declared a 10th outbreak of Ebola in 40 years.A fifth of about 1,700 known and suspected Ebola infections were reported in the past three weeks alone, said Capobianco -- an ""alarming"" rise.Yet the Red Cross and Red Crescent organisations have received less than half of the 31.5 million Swiss francs ($31.2 million, 28 million euros) they had requested to fund the Ebola response in DRC and preparedness efforts in neighbouring Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.  ""The scale and quality of activities that will be performed by Red Cross volunteers will dramatically diminish within the next two weeks unless funding is provided,"" Capobianco said.The Ebola fightback is also hampered by fighting in the affected regions and attacks on medical teams, as well as locals viewing the international effort at prevention, including burials, with suspicion.'Tipping point'The outbreak is the second deadliest outbreak on record after an epidemic in West Africa in 2014-2016 that infected nearly 29,000 people and killed more than 11,300.A study conducted after that outbreak found that efforts to safely bury highly contagious bodies of those who die from Ebola may have prevented 10,500 cases and decreased the scale of the outbreak by more than third. Capobianco said more than 5,000 burials have been conducted since August, about 20 per day on average, adding ""the containment of the epidemic depends on this.""But the process is complex and costly.Each burial costs about $500, covering the participation of a 12-person team, protective suits for them and grieving family members, as well as body bags and coffins.For now, the outbreak has been contained to North Kivu and Ituri provinces, but ""we are at tipping point"", warned Capobianco, with growing fears it would spread to other regions or neighbouring countries.

30,Burundi court seizes assets of opposition figures - Daily Monitor,"Burundi's chief justice has ordered the seizure of property belonging to jailed army officers and exiled opposition activists accused of supporting a supposed coup plot against President Pierre Nkurunziza.The order, signed late Tuesday, targets dozens of government critics accused of spearheading a failed challenge against Nkurunziza in May 2015, when he announced he would run for a controversial third term.The property and assets belonging to 32 opposition leaders and journalists in exile, and nine jailed military officers, should be ""exploited by the state"", said the order co-signed by the Supreme Court chief justice and attorney general.Government critics said the ruling made a mockery of Burundi's judiciary and underscored the ongoing persecution meted out against the beleaguered political opposition.""Pierre Nkurunziza and his henchmen continue the persecution of opponents of the 3rd mandate by seizing their property... a decision which once again ridicules the Burundian justice system,"" Vital Nshimirimana, one of the exiled opposition figures targeted in the order, wrote on Twitter.Burundi exploded into violence when Nkurunziza announced his candidacy in April 2015. He was re-elected in July of that year.The chaos that followed left at least 1,200 people dead, according to estimates by the International Criminal Court which has opened an investigation.More than 400,000 people fled the country, including journalists critical of the government and civil society activists.In May 2016, the Supreme Court sentenced 21 army officers allegedly involved in the failed coup against Nkurunziza to life in prison. A few months earlier, 17 other officers were jailed for five to 30 years over their role in the alleged plot.The main opposition party says dozens of its activists have been arrested this year alone in ""manhunt"" that has seen their meetings shutdown and leaders harassed.Burundi's independent media were among the most flourishing in the region until the 2015 crisis, when several radio and television stations were destroyed and about 100 journalists forced into exile.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Burundi-court-seizes-assets-opposition-figures/688340-5119200-14civ20z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post34.png
31,Sudan protesters vow to press on after talks suspended - Daily Monitor,"Sudanese protesters voiced regret Thursday at an army decision to suspend crucial talks on installing civilian rule but vowed to press on with a sit-in despite being targeted in fresh violence.Army generals and protest leaders had been expected to come to an agreement on Wednesday over the make-up of a new body to govern Sudan for three years.The issue is the thorniest to have come up in ongoing talks on reinstating civilian rule after the generals took over following the ouster of longtime autocratic president Omar al-Bashir last month.But in the early hours of Thursday, the chief of Sudan's ruling military council, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, announced the talks had been suspended for 72 hours as security in Khartoum had deteriorated.He demanded that protesters dismantle roadblocks in Khartoum, open bridges and railway lines connecting the capital and ""stop provoking security forces"".The Alliance for Freedom and Change, the group that is leading the protest movement and negotiating the transfer of power with the army rulers, called the move ""regrettable"".""It ignores the developments achieved in negotiations so far... and the fact that Wednesday's meeting was to finalise the agreement, which would have stopped the escalations such as roadblocks.""The protest movement vowed to press on with the ""sit-in outside the army headquarters and across the country"".- Several roadblocks removed -Protesters said the army aimed to provoke demonstrators.""They want to provoke the people by delaying the negotiations ... but the negotiations will resume now that the roadblocks have been removed,"" said Moatassim Sayid, a protester at the sit-in.On Thursday morning, several roadblocks in downtown Khartoum had been taken down, an AFP correspondent reported, adding that troops from the paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF) were deployed in some areas.Roadblocks on key thoroughfares in the capital are being used by demonstrators to pressure the generals to transfer power to a civilian administration.The talks began on Monday and achieved significant breakthroughs, but have also been marred by violence that left five protesters and an army major dead and many wounded from gunshots.Protesters allege that members of RSF were behind the violence.But Burhan said there were ""armed elements among demonstrators who were shooting at security forces.""He defended the paramilitary group, saying ""it had taken the side of the people"" during the uprising that toppled Bashir on April 11.The British ambassador to Khartoum said Sudanese security forces had fired at protesters on Wednesday when eight were reported wounded near the sit-in, where thousands remain camped demanding the generals step down.""Extremely concerned by use of live ammunition by Sudanese security forces against protesters in Khartoum today, with reports of civilian casualties,"" Irfan Siddiq wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.""Military council must act to stop this now. No more excuses."" US blames generals Washington blamed the military council for the bloodshed that left six dead on Monday.""The tragic attacks on protesters ... were clearly the result of the Transitional Military Council trying to impose its will on the protesters by attempting to remove roadblocks,"" the US embassy said in a statement.The protest movement said the generals wanted the demonstrators to restrict themselves to the sit-in area.Protesters are demanding a civilian-led transition, which the generals have steadfastly resisted since bowing to their demands and toppling Bashir.During the first two days of talks the two sides had agreed on an overall civilian structure, including a three-year transitional period for the full transfer of power to a civilian administration.They had also agreed that parliament be composed of 300 members for the transition, with around two-thirds from the alliance and the rest drawn from other political groups.The make-up of the new sovereign council has been the toughest part of the negotiations, with the two sides so far proposing different compositions of the body which is expected to take all key decisions concerning national issues.The generals want it to be military-led, while the protesters insist on a majority civilian body.General Yasser al-Atta, one of the members of the current ruling military council, had vowed earlier this week to reach a deal by Thursday that ""meets the people's aspirations"".The new council is expected to form a transitional civilian government, which would then prepare for the first post-Bashir election after the three-year changeover period ends.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Sudan-protesters-vow-to-press-after-talks-suspended/688334-5118460-pp4htl/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post35.png

The country's Vice President, Samia Suluhu, through the Government Communications Unit said authorities in TZ had resolved to ban plastic bags with effect from June 1. The Government of Tanzania wishes to make an official note to travellers planning to travel to Tanzania that from 1st June 2019 all plastic carrier bags, regardless of their thickness will be prohibited from being imported, exported, manufactured, sold, stored, supplied and used in Mainland Tanzania,  the statement reads in part. Visitors to Tanzania are advised to avoid carrying plastic carrier bags or packing plastic carrier bags or items in plastic carrier bags in the suitcase or hand luggage before embarking on visit to Tanzania.

Uganda had introduced a similar policy under former Finance Minister Saida Bbumba but didn t work. In Uganda the failed ban sought to protect environment from the dangers of plastic bags locally known as Kaveera.The Government statement also indicated that plastics carrier items known as  Ziploc bags  that are specifically designed to carry toiletries will be permitted as they are expected to remain in the permanent possession of visitors and are not expected to be disposed of in the county.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Tanzania-bans-plastic-bags-warns-travellers/688340-5118414-g9fbnb/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post36.png
33,Ocaya to bring his car dream to life - Daily Monitor,"Born to Silverno Orinyo from Zombo, Matthias Ocaya, 25, is one of the innovators in the vocational field, thanks to his persistence. An old student of Otoroga Boys Primary School in Zombo, Ocaya started dreaming about joining vocational education then, but his father would not hear any of it.  After Primary Seven, I told my father that I wanted to enroll in a vocational institute although he wanted me to continue to secondary school. So, I joined St Aloysius Secondary School in Zombo District and while there, my knowledge on innovation developed,  Ocaya recalls. He got career guidance and learned that he could actually go enroll in a vocational school after O-Level.  Whenever we got holidays, I would go to different people in my village for apprenticeship in plumbing work, building and wiring. I did that from Senior One holidays to Senior Four. In Senior Four vacation, I built myself a house and since I wanted to make a door for it, I went to a certain carpenter in my village to ask him for his equipment,  he says. But the carpenter instead asked him to come and help him at his workshop since he had no one to work with. Ocaya started work the following day.  I made my door but also learnt more skills, so, next, I made myself a bed but before I could take it home, a buyer asked for it. I told him I could make him one and he paid me Shs200,000. This was the first money I earned and through him, I got many more customers,  he narrates. Although Ocaya did carpentry work, being a mechanic was his ultimate dream. After Senior Four vacation, he still expressed interest in vocational education but his father still did not want him to go.  I joined A-Level at Paidha Senior Secondary School but class things had gotten a bit slow for me. I looked for a garage in the area where I would work at the weekend and during the holiday. It was then that I thought about making a prototype of a car from timber,  he says. Realising his dreamWith six points after A-Level, he joined vocational school. Ocaya joined Lugogo Vocational Institute in Kampala in 2016.  Two weeks into the course, I went to my lecturer and told him I wanted to build a car. He asked me how I was going to do it and told me to write a proposal with all the details and to also draw what I wanted to make. He also asked me whether I would be able to pull it off,  Ocaya explains. In first year, when real life projects were introduced and they were asked to make stoves, Ocaya had bigger fish to fry in mind.  In second year when they told us to build something, I just wanted to build a car. I already had my proposal and I told the teacher that I wanted to make a car, but he said that could not work. I went and talked to the head of department, who gave me a go ahead,  he recalls.Financial constraitsOcaya had no money. So during holidays, he went to the village and found work.  I earned Shs150,000 which I used to buy some things such as a motor, magnetar and other things for my prototype.  Ocaya spent two and a half months building the car in addition to building and designing things such as DC stoves, water pumps and a car heater for friends in order to get money for his prototype. After completing his prototype, he took it to the teacher and showed off his dream. The prototype was a solar driven car with an external steering wheel which he could use to control its movements.  But because I had a tuition debt, I went back to the village to look for money. From there, I was called by the principal for a vocational exhibition at Parliament in November 2017. I was also allowed to do my examinations. But when I went back to the village with my Shs400,000 that I had got from people who saw my innovation at the exhibition, I decided to build a big car which I am currently working on but won t give a lot of details about it for now,  Ocaya asserts.  I was also recently invited to an exhibition at UBTEB, where I exhibited my car before the Education minister Janet Museveni. But as I work on my big project, I also work in a garage in my village because I still have a debt at school,  he says. Ocaya needs about Shs95m to build his first big prototype of a solar driven car. Other student innovationsTogether with his robotics team, the International University of East Africa students built a car surveillance system. Andrew Bakashaba said, this is a smart home surveillance system that will have multiple functions. It will be able to; pick up sound, take videos, see what is at a distance, will be able to detect obstacles and able to control the lighting system in a home using a timer. It will also be able to pick feedback, move for example in a compound or house and do all those functions. I specifically did the parking coding that detects obstacles.

34,Want to boost your career  Read - Daily Monitor,"Gives me confidenceMy job is to sell knowledge, history and tell a story the clients have no idea about. This has taught me to read constantly. Everyday I read something in relation to travel. Before taking any person to the site, I visit it first, make research and buy any written literature about it. I read any travel literature I come across naturally. I even read about the different Christian historical sites. I may not necessarily buy a book, but I carry out research and read online. This has opened my mind and widened my knowledge about different cultures. When I am talking to people; I speak with confidence because I am sure about what I am telling them. Mary Josephina Nanyonga, tours and travel dealerMotivated my career choiceMy reading journey started while in primary school. I enjoyed reading fictional stories such as Mr Hare tales because I found them entertaining. While in secondary school I would visit the school library to read novels during my free time. I read a book titled To Be the Best by Barbara Taylor which motivated me to aim higher and opened me up to more of her work such as A woman of Substance, which inspired me to pursue a career in finance. Currently, I read mathematics-related articles and mainly motivational books. My current read is Nice Girls Don t Get the Corner Office which talks about unconscious mistakes women make that sabotage their careers.Ann Kyakuwaire, auditorReading makes me practicalKyamanywa handles civil law cases to do with property, family issues that entail divorce, annulment, child custody. Because of his choice of work, he says his reading is not about to end. To manage handling the different cases I realised I need to have an inquisitive mind, excellent analytical skills and the ability to think.  At times clients expect an immediate answer. With this I came to a conclusion that lawyers need to be good readers. I read books such as Civil rights and Liberties in the 21 century, In Our Defense. The Civil Rights book gives an analysis of the Supreme Court s landmark rulings on civil rights and liberties. Reading has made me resourceful to my clients, taught me new court presentations and has helped me improve on my vocabulary. However, it calls for commitment. Currently, I am reading My Life in Court by Louise Nizer. Edward Cooper Kyamanywa, lawyerBroadened my thinkingMy reading culture started at the age of 10. In those early years I read a lot of adventure books. I would literally feel as if I was on the same adventure journey as the characters in the book. As a teen, I began reading literature from authors such as Jeffrey Archer, Wilbur Smith and Danielle Steele, which helped me understand new concepts about life and my vocabulary. While in high school he was introduced to African authors such as Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and others whose works gave him a new understanding of the continent. Today, I read different genres of literature, popular psychology, faith-based books, biographies, African books on history and economics, leadership and management books, motivational books. Reading has broadened my mind. I am able to know and understand a variety of topics. Currently, I am reading Purple Cow by Seth Godin, which is about avoiding being average. If you want to develop a reading culture, start slowly with one book at a time, those that you will enjoy, as well as joining a book club.Stirling Gapara, leadership and management consultantEnlightened meAmos Wekesa s reading culture did not develop until 2001 when he committed to reading for two hours a day. Reading different literature such as Transformation of Singapore from third world to second world, Problems of Africa, he says his reading kept improving. When reading, I spare 45 minute to read about a topic I am involved in. This has given me leverage over many people who come to me for information. I was influenced into reading by my wife. My wife is a good reader and so are my children. I realised if I did not read I would remain the idiot of the family. Writing has also given me an opportunity to read. The more you write, the more you read.Amos Wekesa, tourism entrepreneurKeeps my brain activeMy father used to read a lot. When I was a child, he would read to me story books written in Rutooro. Slowly, I began to broaden my reading scope. When I joined Nyakasura School, I started a newspaper called The Student. But today, I read medicine-related material, I read about the latest advances, news about medicine and I do a lot of research.  I keep tickling my brain by reading all the necessary literature within my profession and others I find relevant. Vincent Karuhanga, doctorLeaders are readers Leaders are readers. If you want to be a leader then you must be a reader. If you want to excel in any field such as being a politician or fashion designer you have to be a long-life learner and reader.  In life there has to be continuous improvement in all that we do. And the way you can improve is to continuously read.   If the last time you read a book was the time you graduated from university, yet you have been working for the last five years, it means you are stunted. As an educationist, I read constantly. I believe, the more you read, the better you become. Through reading I have been mentored by different people I admire but can never have conversations with. My recent great read has been by Michelle Obama s, Becoming. But currently I am reading The 15 Rules of Growth by John Maxwell. He says growth is intentional, not accidental. To inspire my children to read, each time any of them reads a book I put Shs10,000 in their piggy bank.

35,"Digital libraries, game-changer in rural schools - Daily Monitor","In October last year, Nyombi Thembo, the director Rural Communications Development Fund at the Uganda Communications Commission, announced government would introduce video conferencing lessons aimed at connecting rural schools to their urban counterparts. According to Thembo, the move is aimed at providing rural and urban students the same learning opportunities. We want a situation where a good Mathematics teacher in St Mary s College, Kisubi is giving a lesson, and some 100 rural schools in Karamoja following this lesson,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries. To support the move, National Social Security Fund (NSSF) has injected more than Shs450m to provide tablets to mainly underpriviledged secondary schools so as to compete favourably with priviledged schools.While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation, owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries.

While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent, especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.So far, the Fund has donated at least 440 digital learning tablets to 11 schools with each school receiving 40 tablets. The project is expected to benefit more than 3,500 students in Senior Four and Senior Six in the next one year and more than 5,200 students in the next two years. Aggrey Kibenge, the Under Secretary in the Ministry of Education and Sports, says the initiative will help students in underpriviledged schools to rise up to the occasion and compete favourably with their counterparts in priviledged schools.  Students in schools that do not have access to modern learning facilities will get exposure to and access modern learning resources and tools. I look forward to a time when all secondary schools will benefit from this type of digital technology to transform teaching and learning,  he said.Infrastructure issuesSanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher of Mpummudde Seed Secondary School, said he is supportive of the project and hopes it will help in reducing the workload for teachers and expose students to a wide range of learning materials as well as the digital world.However, he expressed worry that due to limited space in some government-aided schools for instance, as a result of the surging numbers in student population, buildings to house digital libraries must be put up.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space for this digital library. My teachers do not have where to sit because the staffroom is now occupied with the tablets,  he lamented. James Asili, the head of department for secondary schools and coordinator of the Digital Library project at NCDC, is optimistic that the tablet will prepare students for a digital curriculum with multiple content. The tablet costs Shs600,000 but Asili is hopeful that the cost will reduce with time. How the tablet works Ivan Mukasa, the software engineer in charge of the digital library project, says the digital tablets have been tailored to the school curriculum inclusive of all subjects for both O and A levels.  The tablet has been fitted with virtual learn software that incorporates the curriculum for both O and A levels. Each subject follows topics as designed in the curriculum. We shall keep modifying it to suit the students  needs,  he reveals.He further explains,  At the end of each topic, a student can do a self-assessment basing on the three levels of assessment. If the student fails the assessment, they are advised to retake and complete it. All the students  work and assessments are stored on the cloud for review by teachers as well as NCDC officials for analysis on how students are progressing in different subjects, for instance by analysing the difficult and easy topics.    It is also designed with an e-book readers  icon which enables students to buy online text books and read on their own. The virtual learn also permits performance tracking by schools and parents that can be accessed on Android mobile phones,  Mukasa adds.The tablet can be used both online and offline. Even better, a solar backpack has been provided in cases of power blackout or shortages.  At first the goal was to develop a virtual lab for sciences but then later we agreed to incorporate both arts and sciences. Students can even tap into the syllabus and read ahead of the teacher and do assessments.  Students react Hendrick Oboth, a Senior Six student, says he is enthusiastic about the digital library and hopes it will improve his learning.  I have realised there are things teachers fail to explain well in class but which you can read and understand on the tablets on your own. Similarly, Doreen Mugala, a Senior Four student, says it will ease her studies and help her get more details through research.  I will also be able to acquire skills in ICT which I may require in future,  she hopefully says.Knowing how many rural school grapple with poorly stocked libraries or nonexistent libraries at all, digital libraries could be the timely intervention to bridge the gap between rural underprivildged schools and priviledged ones.Other edu-tabsKaino Africa, a smart school management tech company last year launched their flagship product, the Kaino Tablet crafted for the Ugandan primary pupil. This Education Technology (EdTech) tablet comes with curriculum aligned teacher guides that show the teacher lesson plans; how they are supposed to proceed with the class, what examples to give as well as time the lesson is supposed to start and end. It comes with well-prepared notes from Ugandan content providers, not to mention, it has offline and online past papers, exams and instant assessments at the end of the tests. All this comes in addition to digitalised text books that are cheap (between USD1 to USD10) (about Shs38,000).BeneficiariesThe beneficiary schools include: Mpummudde Secondary School in Jinja, Nabumali High School Mbale, Atutur Seed Secondary School in Soroti, Sir Tito Winyi Secondary School in Hoima, Kagamba Secondary School in Mbarara, Kyenjojo Secondary School in Fort Portal and St. Charles Lwanga SS, Kasasa in Masaka.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Digital-libraries-game-changer-rural-schools/688336-5101196-e93vek/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post39.png
36,Essay challenge brings students  knowledge on biotechnology to life - Daily Monitor,"In a bid to familiarise students with modern biotechnology, National Crop Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) organised the Biotechnology Essay Writing Contest among secondary and university students.Resty Nansubuga, the 17-year-old science student at St Joseph s Girls Senior Secondary School, who scooped the best essay award in the secondary school category, says she only learnt about plant breeding using modern biotechnology in a bid to develop Genetically Modified Organisms crops from her teacher recently.Her essay focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food under the theme;  Modern Biosciences for more nutritious food . She explained the use of breeding crops using advanced technology to develop improved varieties which have better nutrition and are high yielding hence capable of feeding the world s growing population.Organised by the Uganda Biosciences Information centre, the competition attracted several students who, like Nansubuga, had scanty knowledge about crop breeding. Widespread issueBut this lack of knowledge is also true in majority of Ugandans who are ignorant about plant breeding using modern biotechnology and mistake improved plant varieties such as hybrids with GMOs.Thus scientists at NaCRRI have put in efforts to sensitise school children right from primary to university level by organising essay competitions where the students are required to search for information about application of modern biotechnology in plant breeding. The 6th edition of the essay competition awardees were given certificates, plaques, laptops and a one-week internship training at NaCRRI.This was the first time most of the competing students were visiting the research institute and its laboratory where tissue culture cassava breeding is being done by breeding them in tests tubes. The students were also amazed to see tissue culture cassava growing from test tubes to a full plant in the field.Enlightened Nasubuga was excited to receive her award and promised to sensitise fellow students at her school and other communities on the importance of scientists using emerging technologies to breed crops. I do not see any difference between improved cassava, maize and rice varieties with the traditional varieties being tested at the institute. I have heard that many Ugandans are opposed to improved crop varieties but it seems people lack knowledge about what the scientists are doing,  she asserted. Students submitted essays under the topic modern Biosciences to produce better nutritious food while Nsubuga focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food citing orange sweet potato and cassava which is bred conventionally and pro vitamin A treangenic banana which contains Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.She is optimistic that she will encourage fellow students to read scientific books to get knowledge especially in Biosciences be it in crop breeding of applied science to developing vaccines and drugs in the health sector.For Marvin Steven Nsubuga, the overall winner in the tertiary and university category, this is his third time participating in the awards. He submitted his first essay in 2015 when he was a Senior Five student and won an accolade, a certificate and a one-week internship at the institute.Nsubuga, a first year Administrative Science student at Kyambogo University, researched on using applied modern biotechnology to breed crops which can be used as a raw material in order to boost the industrial sector. He focused on crops such cassava which farmers will be able to grow and get high yields which can be supplied to brewing industries.  The starch can also be used to process glue and highly processed cassava flour used by industries processing confectionary products. I am currently disseminating this information for government to make good policy,  he noted.On his third time competing, Nsubuga scooped a certificate, plaque, a laptop and a one week internship at the institute. More student researchHe is encouraging university students to be in search of scientific information, especially in agricultural science where scientists are breeding crops to address challenges of climate change and devising ways of feeding the growing population in the world.National Agricultural Research Organisation board chairman, Prof Joseph Obua, urged students to pursue science subjects because science is a driver and engine of economic growth of all nations. I am urging teachers to use the best methods when teaching science subjects; make it simple and practical. This is because children tend to shy away from science subjects because teachers are using complex words which scare them. It is important to simplify the words for students to appreciate science, technology and innovations,  he noted.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Essay-challenge-brings-students-knowledge-biotechnology-life-/688336-5101200-d2t4y2z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post40.png
37,Startup tips crucial to vocational students - Daily Monitor,"One of the major challenges vocational graduates face is lack of start-up capital despite being trained to be job creators not seekers. This sometimes forces them to end up in the job seekers pool which their training was trying to avoid.For a long time, Sophie Joyce Laker, a Fashion and Design student at Kitgum Technical Institute, would worry about starting a business citing lack of money. What Laker did not know though, was that mindset is the first capital and for as long as one s brain is functional, they can do anything they set out to do. She also came to learn that an entrepreneur must not keep complaining about challenges such as rent and delays in supplies but rather always devise solutions. The Fashion and Design student has since started a business; Rwot-Twero Workshop in Kitgum Town. But it was not until the Skills for Life programme recently that Laker realised all this and more about mentorship in business.Thirty youthful entrepreneurs from Kitgum Technical Institute and Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute in Gulu, received training in business start-ups and expansion skills from Enterprise Uganda experts, to ensure their dreams are realised. Subsequent follow-up visits to measure their progress coupled with mentorship have been ongoing since. Funded by Uganda Breweries (UBL), this expert training and mentoring under the Skills for Life programme aims at avoiding this. Launched in 2001, the programme has so far seen more than 114 scholarships awarded to academically deserving yet economically disadvantaged students with the aim of curbing youth unemployment and high school dropouts.The problemUganda s small and medium scale businesses are estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000; employing 2.5 million people (about 90 per cent of private sector jobs) and contributing about 20 per cent to the country s Gross Domestic Product, while producing 80 per cent of manufactured output. In fact, studies have ranked Uganda as one of the most entrepreneurial nations in the world. However, the business failure rate is equally high   standing at more than 50 per cent. This is due to various challenges, including lack of financial support and vital skills including entrepreneurial, management, marketing and financial planning. Other challenges include lack of business records, low corporate governance, poor banking and borrowing history, a culture that disrespects business contracts, fierce local and international competition and limited access to business development services.In fact Anjijuka Narasi Kambaho, the senior information and communication officer at Uganda Business and Technical Examinations Board, says starting personal businesses is not always easy for vocational trained graduates. There are expenses involved including purchasing the necessary equipment, paying rent and the required licenses needed for operation. Sometimes people want to first get formal jobs in order save and accumulate money for starting their own businesses later,  he says.Registered successAt Enterprise Uganda, a public-private institution aimed at promoting SMEs as the main vehicle for expanding production, providing sustainable jobs and enhancing economic growth, the Acholi youth are likely to avoid falling on the wayside like many similar businesses countrywide.  The mindset and entrepreneurship training model is an effective standard in transforming the behaviour of participants and triggering the desired action to start a business. This is corroborated by the statistic where 26 out of the 30 students actually started business after the December 2018 training, representing a 87 per cent success rate,  says Rosemary Mutyabule, the lead trainer. One such students is Nelson Mandela, of Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute who believes his poultry business can help him contribute to his family and community. Located in Custom-Corner Village, Layibi Division in Gulu municipality, Mandela s farm has 235 22-days old broiler chicks, fully vaccinated in line with the requirements from the trainers. During a visit to assess his business last month, it was discovered that Mandela, who mainly sells to roadside chicken roasters in Gulu Town feels his enterprise is delivering tangible benefits. He has earned Shs1.9m in chicken sales from his first stock giving him a profit of Shs300,000.  This poultry business is giving me a sense of purpose in life. I even sell the chicken droppings and earn at least Shs5,000 every 100kg sack,  Mandela says. Paul Otim, a Gulu-based business counsellor and mentor, who assessed Mandela s farm, believes, that though new, the enterprise has great potential to grow given the market opportunities available and the determination of the young entrepreneur.  A planned farm exposure visit will undoubtedly reinforce his potential to develop the business, especially on technical methods of handling the poultry, cost saving using local resources plus proper records management,  says Otim. Follow-upBroadly, the Skills for Life programme does not stop at the training or skilling phase, but the beneficiaries undergo various follow-up visits by the implementers who ensure the trainees  learning and development is in fulfillment of the programme s objectives.The latest additions to this initiative are 20 students of Kabale s African College of Commerce and Technology and another 20 from Datamine Institute in Kampala for whom UBL has provided up to about Shs115m to cover tuition for their second year of study, entrepreneurship training as well as seed capital for those that would have excelled in the programme.And for Sunday Auma Okee, an Electrical Systems and Maintenance student at Kitgum Technical Institute, the scholarship, aside from helping him stay in school, has helped him learn to start a business with what he has and in fact his dream of opening an electrical workshop seems closer. Interventions Edward Asiimwe, the principal at Uganda Rural Development and Training institute, says policy makers, the government in particular needs to support vocational training at all levels.  Just like in other education sectors, increased funding and investment is also mandatory in vocational institutions.  In addition, Asiimwe believes that students need to be continuously given the proper career guidance to enable them make better informed academic choices.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Startup-tips-crucial-vocational-students/688336-5101216-aaicob/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post41.png
38,"Influx of private schools, what s the catch  - Daily Monitor","Joseph Byaruhanga, earns Shs300,000 per month as a security guard. He has a family of three children to cater for, as well as paying other bills. His first two children attend a nearby private primary school in Namasuba, Zanna where he pays fees of Shs170,000 for each child totaling to Shs340,000 a term. Apart from tuition, he has to buy scholastic materials and other fees as directed by the school. Byaruhanga is not your rich parent but he sure is among the growing list of parents who year by year join the private schools trend as the best way to educate their children.  The problem with universal primary education schools is that the population in class is too high. It is possible to find more than 200 pupils in one class. Private schools have a small teacher to pupil ratio. You will find 50 pupils in a class which is manageable. A child in a class of many pupils will not learn anything and might take long to understand,  Byaruhanga says. In 1997, government introduced Universal Primary Education. Under this arrangement, four children in every family were to study free of charge in all government-aided primary schools. Almost 10 years after UPE, the government introduced Universal Secondary Education becoming the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education. But despite this, parents are increasingly parting with huge sums of money to educate their children in private schools. As such numbers of private schools increase each year.According to the Uganda Schools Guide website, as of today there are more than 13,000 private schools in 127 districts in Uganda. Among the private schools are the high end ones that offer foreign curriculums and target wealthy parents and the ones that target middle income earners. The endless challenges plaguing most public schools have increasingly eroded public confidence. They have been labelled as for the  poor  forcing some parents to take children to private schools where they hope to find better education for their children.The increase in enrollment of students has not only accelerated a rise in private schools across the country; but also the cost of education. Overwhelming numbersIn January 2018, Alex Kakooza, the permanent secretary of Ministry of Education and Sports while at the Senior One selection exercise at Uganda Manufacturers Association grounds announced that government had scrapped Universal Secondary Education in private schools under the Public Private Partnership (PPP). At the peak was a challenge of funding and an increasing number of ghost students. This did not go down well with parents who had fear of transferring their children to public schools for the USE programme dreading the appalling conditions of overcrowding. For instance, at Masindi Secondary School, a government funded school, students study in shifts; some in the morning to noon while others from 2pm to evening. According to Byaruhanga,  Some parents take their children to UPE schools because the tuition is relatively lower there. Personally I do not have much money but I want my children to at least have a good education. I would rather pay in installments to make sure that my children study in a private school. But the move to scrap USE from private schools was intended to raise money and ensure that every sub county has a public school. According to Kakooza, more than 615 government sub-counties had no secondary schools. At the time, government would pay Shs47,000 for each student per term in a private school under the USE programme. Mpumudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District is one of the new schools established by government to create equity in providing education across the country. However, since its establishment, the school is still housed in Mpumudde Primary School buildings with a few new classroom blocks. Sanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher, recently expressed worry over a surging student population with no facilities while at the launch of a digital library at the school.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space where to put this digital library. My teachers have nowhere to sit because the staffroom is now full of digital tablets,  he said.  We want extra building materials and land for expansion and creation of access roads and a laboratory with chemicals and equipment,  he added.Aggrey Kibenge, the undersecretary at the Ministry of Education and Sports who was the chief guest at the event gave a one worded response.  We shall look into the matter at the ministry.  High price to pay With appalling conditions in both public primary and secondary schools, private schools have been increasing over time to attend to the needs of frustrated parents but at a much higher cost.According to the ministry of Education, the Private Schools and Institutions department was inaugurated in 2008, consequent to the restructuring of the ministry to cater for the ever expanding private investment in education. Since the government decision to liberalise the education sector in 1993, thousands of schools and institutions have been set up by private investors. In the secondary sub-sector, the number of private schools, at about 4,000, is more than double the number of government-funded schools. Light Academy on Entebbe road is one such private school that specifically cater for the middle class who can afford the fees. Mahad Budda, a student at Light Academy (former Turkish), says the school charges between Shs1.8m and Shs2m per term and the fees increase termly. However, he says, the services are worth the money because the teacher-student ratio is low with each class stream having between 28 and 32 students. He adds that the sickbay is good with fulltime nurses as well as better accommodation.Other private schools around Kampala and Wakiso districts charge between Shs500,000 and Shs2m as tuition fees for either day or boarding section. Scraped fundingAt the start of 2018, the ministry of Education scrapped funding to 792 private secondary schools which had been implementing the Universal Secondary Education programme. The ministry officials argued that the government has built capacity over the years in areas where they did not have any government-aided schools and are now ready to absorb those students in these institutions, adding that this, however, will be done in phases. The move left an estimated number of students who were expected to benefit from the Public Private Partnership in Senior One stranded.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/private-schools-children-UPE-a-laboratory-parents/688336-5112742-11d5ivi/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-17/post42.png
39,The right time to get a master s degree - Daily Monitor,"There is an increase in the number of universities in the country, making it easy for one to acquire qualifications. And as such many young people are going for graduate studies soon after their undergraduate qualifications, and as with many issues, this, too, has its advantages and disadvantages. Before Rosta Asiimwe completed her undergraduate degree in Human Nutrition, she had applied for a Masters in Public Health Nutrition.  I worked on-and-off for five months with research organisations. That little experience motivated me to take my master s degree seriously. Previously, I was just going through the motions but then I became interested in research. Besides, the pay is good in research work. The advantage of rushing into a postgraduate programme early is that you are still young and have the time to concentrate. On the downside, you tend to continue in the same course you began at undergraduate level. Gaining work experience opens the mind to a variety of career choices. The merits of growing your career first Spending a few years in the work arena can help a person focus their career goals. Grace Kenganzi, who has a Bachelor s degree in Mass Communication, undertook a postgraduate in Media and Communications after working for more than three years in a media house.  By that time, I was sure of the experience I wanted to attain   the kind that I could not get from my workplace. I had majored in public relations in my undergraduate course and since I worked for a media organisation, I had learnt on the job. I was more deliberate as I looked for a postgraduate course; I did not want just any media course because in the future, I want to branch into communication,  said Kenganzi.Samuel Bakutana, the chief executive officer Inspired Leaders International, says by concentrating on growing a career, a person comes to terms with the real demands of the job world, instead of making up their mind based on what they are told in the lecture room.  The working experience gives you a more mature perspective. By the time I went for my Master s in Leadership, I was already aware of the glaring gaps, the available opportunities and the needs of my future work. I approached the studies with a more mature, sober and committed attitude,  he says, adding:  A working background enables you relate with the programme content at a more real, practical and personal level because you have gone through the scenarios (or have examples to draw from) being presented in the course materials as you progressively apply the new or renewed learning. The financial questionWhen you are younger, chances of getting a scholarship are higher than if you are above 35 years. However, all is not bleak.  There are specialised programmes, for example The Chevening Scholarship Programme, that only gives scholarships to people who have careers,  Kenganzi says, adding,  You can only know about them when you are working. If I studied my postgraduate much earlier, I would not have thought of studying abroad or applying for a scholarship. Generally, because a master s degree can be expensive and students may be uncertain about what they want to do with their lives, students should gain some real-world experience before beginning a master s degree programme.Fitting into the labour marketEmployers are comfortable employing someone who already has job experience because, from a purely financial perspective, training of new staff is expensive and may not pay off immediately. Kenganzi believes her work experience and her master s degree gives her an edge.  I know what I want and I will ask for it. I cannot just accept anything thrown my way.  Asiimwe is not so confident.  Getting a job will be quite tricky. In the Ugandan (labour) market, (work) experience is the password and I know those who have it have an advantage over me.
