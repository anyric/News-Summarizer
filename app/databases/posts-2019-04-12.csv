0,Government defends self on MTN boss deportation - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. Government yesterday defended its decision to deport MTN former Uganda Chief Executive Officer (CEO).The Senior State Attorney, Mr Wanyama Kodoli, told court that the former CEO, Mr Wim Joris Vanhelleputte s application seeking a review of Internal Affairs Minister Jeje Odongo s deportation order was misconceived. He said the minister did not need any permission to deport Mr Vanhelleputte. The Immigration Act of Parliament gives the minister full powers to deport someone and whoever is aggrieved with his decision there is another option of appealing,  Mr Wanyama told court. Mr Vanhelleputte s lawyer, Mr Wycliffe Birungi, told court that the deportation order issued against him by Gen Odongo was inappropriate. The process used by the Minister of Internal Affairs to declare the applicant (Mr Vanhelleputte) was undesirable and his subsequent deportation was high-handed and or arbitrary and contrary to the law as the applicant was never accorded any fair or just treatment before, during and after making of the deportation order,  Mr Birungi submitted. ResolutionJustice Henrietta Wolayo set May 10 for Mr Vanhelleputte to make written submissions while the respondent, the Attorney General, will make a rejoinder on June 17. In the suit, Mr Vanhelleputte, a Belgian national married to a Ugandan, explains why he continued communicating with the earlier deported MTN-Uganda staff, which he says was the reason for his deportation on February 14 this year. He says he continued with communication to seek answers why they had not yet handed over office at the time of their deportation.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-defends-self-MTN-boss-deportation-/688334-5067808-9nmanb/index.html,/static/img/post0.png
1,Court orders government pay to JSC members full salary - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. Court has ordered government to pay remunerations enhanced for the members of Judicial Service Commission as they are entitled to in their terms of appointment.The court ordered the secretary to Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Public Service to pay the members  emoluments effective July 1, 2018. Documents submitted show that each of the eight JSC members is entitled to a retainer allowance of Shs19.2m every month.Entitled to full emolumentsHigh Court Judge Andrew Bashaija declared that part time members of the JSC are in law members of the full commission within the law and are entitled to full emoluments and all other benefits as set out in the wage enhancement package approved by Parliament in the Appropriations Act 2018.The court order resulted from a case in which two JSC members Christine Hellen Aporu Amongin and Rosemary Nyakikongoro sued the Attorney General and the JSC Secretary seeking a declaration that part time members of the Commission are entitled to full salary, emoluments and all other benefits as set out in the wage enhancement package approved by Parliament.Appointed in 2016 on a four-year tenure, the complainants argued that in May 2017, President Museveni approved a request to enhance their emoluments which were also approved by Parliament in January 2018.Through their lawyers, the JSC members accused the Ministry of Public Service PS and JSC secretary of deliberately refusing to pay the revised emoluments. Justice Bashaija ruled that it was improper, irrational and illegal for the secretary to the JSC not to act in accordance with the opinion of the Attorney General (AG) who is by law the principal legal adviser of government.The court also faulted the JSC secretary for employing a private lawyer instead of seeking services of the AG who is mandated to represent all government officers. While in the instant application, the AG unequivocally admits to the claim of the applicants, the second respondent (secretary JSC) who should have sought the advice of the AG in the first place instead contradicts the opinion of the AG based on the advice of a private lawyer. This is highly irregular and legally untenable,  the judge ruled and ordered government to pay costs of the petition.The court ruled that the argument presented by the respondents that a cabinet decision amended the Appropriations Act and the emoluments had no merit. An Act of Parliament supersedes cabinet decisions, resolutions or circulars. A cabinet resolution has no force of law. It cannot amend any provision of law enacted by Parliament which has the sole constitutional mandate and power to make laws,  Justice Bashaija ruled.He ruled that the neglect and or refusal by the JSC Secretary to pay the members in accordance with their terms of appointment was erroneous, irrational and improper. Fulltime benefits. The amount of money each JSC member is entitled to per month.

2,MP accused of aiding the escape of murder suspect - Daily Monitor,"Bufumbira North County Member of Parliament, Mr John Nizeyimana Kamara, is on the spot for allegedly aiding a murder suspect to escape from police detention.Mr Kamara is accused of aiding a suspect who had been detained at Kisoro Police Station in connection with the death of a 59-year-old man.Nizeyimana was allegedly last seen with the suspect, at Cyril Maniriho s bar in Suma Trading Centre.The next day, Nizeyimana s torso was found, leading to the arrest of Sebagyenzi as a prime suspect, according to Mr Merida Manihiro, a resident of the area.He was detained at Nyabwishenya Police post.On Wednesday evening, the MP who was in the company of four army escorts, stormed the police post and ordered police officers who were on duty, to release the suspect.He later drove away with the suspect.Mr Elly Maate, the Kigezi Region Police spokesperson says that the hunt for Mr Kamara and and the suspect is on-going.He said the case is registered at Kisoro Police Station.Mr Kamara declined to comment about the matter.This reporter understands that the suspect  is Mr Kamara's campaigning manager in Nyabwishenya Sub-county",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/MP-Kamara-murder-suspect-Kisoro-Maate-police-/688334-5068040-4j30l5z/index.html,/static/img/post2.png
3,"Keep money out of politics, government told - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Demands for the government and other political actors to end the monetisation of politics dominated debate yesterday during the National Symposium on election financing at Speke Resort, Munyonyo in Kampala.The symposium, organised by ActionAid Uganda, Alliance for Financial Monitoring (ACFIM) and The Alternative, which are civil society organisations (CSOs), was held under the theme;  Commercialised Electoral Processes as Barrier to Democratic Dispensation in Africa .The CSOs stated that about Shs2.4 trillion was spent by the different political parties and independent candidates in the campaigns for the 2016 elections, something they say influences the choices the voters make.Ms Donah Ankunda from Rwampara County in Mbarara District revealed that in 2016, she voted against a candidate who had facilitated her journey from Kampala to the village polling station and went for one she thought had ideas. I was given money to travel from Kampala to vote someone but I decided to vote for Kyamadidi [former Rwampara MP] because I thought he had ideas but many people voted in favour of those who provided money,  she said.Mr Jonathan Tundulu, the Kyambogo University guild president, said political parties have been funding their candidates in university elections, urging students to defeat this by sticking to the cause of finding a good leader. The guest speaker, Prof PLO Lumumba, the head of Kenya School of Law, said political offices in Uganda have been turned into money making places but argued that voters need to be sensitised to demand for services instead of campaign money.  Getting elected into political office is now a guarantee that things will come because in Africa, a politician is a gatekeeper, a tax collector and so on. Parliament should not be a place of thieves because it is a holy place,  Prof Lumumba said.He urged the electorate to abandon their  appetite for things they have not worked for , arguing that when a politician spends more than the expected salary for the entire term of office on campaigns, he or she strives to reap whatever they injected in campaigns. However, renowned pan Africanist Kaihura Nkuba argued that campaign financing is the only way poor citizens have their needs catered for. We should not have a crisis in politics because of money. Our people need wealth so that they get dignity but the governments have given up on them. If leaders increase taxes to have money for their big salaries, why would people not demand for money to elect them   said Dr Nkuba.Kasese Woman MP Winfred Kiiza asked the Electoral Commission to always publicise campaign expenditures of political parties, the source of the money and the audited books of accounts.Democratic Party president general Norbert Mao said there is a need to empower the citizens to demand what they want by voting for the right candidates despite receiving money from their rivals.One of the founders of the Alliance for National Transformation, Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu, urged the voters to replicate the vigilance exercised in the parliamentary by-elections in Bugiri, Arua and Jinja municipalities and vote for values despite the money poured in the areas by the ruling NRM.NRM electoral commission chairperson Tanga Odoi said the ruling party should not be blamed for using money in politics, saying campaign financing is used by individuals and parties to compete.  If you don t have money, don t join politics; don t start a political party that will compete with those that have money. The excess of it is what should be curtailed,  he said.EC legal officer Jennifer Angeyo said they tried to educate the masses against the use of money in politics but the population has treated  bribery as a norm .[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Keep-money-out-of-politics-government-told/688334-5067656-7n6ik1/index.html,/static/img/post3.png
4,"I was raised to love our home, says woman who led Sudan protest - Daily Monitor","Khartoum. The young woman in a photo that has come to symbolise the protest movement in Sudan has been identified as Alaa Salah, a 22-year-old architecture student in Khartoum.Salah told the Guardian she was happy that the image, taken on Monday evening at a demonstration in the Sudanese capital, had been viewed so widely. I m very glad that my photo let people around the world know about the revolution in Sudan   Since the beginning of the uprising I have been going out every day and participating in the demonstrations because my parents raised me to love our home,  Salah said.The wave of protests against the 30-year rule of Omar al-Bashir started in December but intensified at the weekend when huge crowds gathered at a crossroads in front of a heavily guarded military complex in the centre of Khartoum.Salah said she does not come from a political background, and took to the streets to fight for a better Sudan.  Our country is above any political parties and any sectarian divisions,  she said. The day they took the photo, I went to 10 different gatherings and read a revolutionary poem. It makes people very enthusiastic. In the beginning I found a group of about six women and I started singing, and they started singing with me, then the gathering became really big.   I have practiced presenting at the university; I don t have an issue with speaking in front of people and at big gatherings. A line in the poem she read -  The bullet doesn t kill. What kills is the silence of people    is popular with protesters, and was chanted by demonstrators in January 2018 and during unrest in September 2013.Salah s mother is a fashion designer working with the traditional Sudanese toub   the dress she was wearing in the photographs   and her father owns a construction company.The garment has become a symbol of the female protesters, and Salah said she had narrowly escaped arrest when she wore the toub at an earlier demonstration.  The toub has a kind of power and it reminds us of the Kandakas,  Salah said.Kandakas were queens of the Nubian kingdom of Kush, which ruled much of what is now modern-day Sudan more than 3,000 years ago.Some commentators have raised concerns that the reference represents only one of Sudan s many ethnic and tribal communities and that while the history of the Nubians is particularly popular with the Sudanese diaspora it excludes many of the country s communities.Salah said she now has to rest her voice as her throat has become sore from all the chanting this week. BY GUARDIANWomen key in Sudan protestsA Sudanese woman propelled to internet fame earlier this week after leading powerful protest chants in the capital told AFP Wednesday that women are key to the uprising against President Omar al-Bashir s iron-fisted rule.  Sudanese women have always participated in revolutions in this country,  Alaa Salah said after footage went viral of her standing on a car, singing and conducting crowds outside the army headquarters in Khartoum.  If you see Sudan s history, all our queens have led the state. It s part of our heritage. In the clips and photos, the elegant Salah stands atop a car wearing a long white headscarf and skirt as she sings and works the crowd, her golden full-moon earrings reflecting light from the fading sunset and a sea of camera phones surrounding her. I m very proud to take part in this revolution and I hope our revolution will achieve its goal,  added the engineering and architecture student at Sudan International University.Dubbed online as  Kandaka  or Nubian queen, she has become a symbol of the protests which she says have traditionally had a female backbone in Sudan.Her new-found fame pushed her to set up her own Twitter account in which she thanked everyone  from the bottom of my heart. The struggle for a democratic and prosperous Sudan continues .Sudan is for allIn another tweet on Wednesday she says she  wanted to get on the car and speak to the people... speak against racism and tribalism in all its forms, which affects everyone across all walks of life. I wanted to speak on behalf of the youth. I wanted to come out and say that Sudan is for all. Supporters celebrated the young protest leader across social media networks, calling her a  hero  and an  icon .  This image from Sudan will be in the history books,  wrote one user. But late on Wednesday she tweeted that she had been receiving  death threats  after her footage went viral. I will not bow down. My voice can not be suppressed,  Salah wrote.Demonstrators have been camped outside the military complex for days asking the army to back them in demands that Bashir step down.Women have made up a large part of the demonstrators that since Saturday have thronged outside the sprawling army complex.Braving regular volleys of tear gas, the crowds have been the biggest yet to rally against Bashir s rule since unrest broke out in late December.

6,Cheptegei gets hero s welcome - Daily Monitor,"Kapchorwa. Hundreds of residents in Sebei Sub-region on Wednesday welcomed Mr Joshua Cheptegei, who won a gold medal at the 2019 World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, on March 30.Mr Cheptegei become the first Ugandan to win gold in the men s senior category at the Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Cross Country Championship. When his convoy arrived in Kapchorwa Town at 11am, business came to a standstill for hours as excited residents flooded the streets to give him a heroic welcome. Mr Cheptegei was accompanied by Mr Moses Ndiema Kipsiro, a former double Commonwealth champion, Mr Jacob Kiplimo, who took silver at the IAAF race and Oscar Chelimo, who won bronze in the Junior Men s race.Residents climbed buildings as boda bodas hooted in unison to welcome the athlete.Others sang and danced for hours as the athlete set foot in his home village in Chepchabai, Kwoti Sub-county. I am grateful and humbled that I made my country proud,  Mr Cheptegei told the residents.He expressed disappointment for failure by government to support the growth and development of talent, especially athletics.Mr Cheptegei urged government to speed up the construction of Teryet High Altitude Training Centre.Bishop Paul Masaba of Sebei Diocese said although the region is blessed with enormous talent, it remains unexploited due to lack of facilities. Government should ensure that the high altitude centre is completed so that we can nurture talent,  he said.Bishop Masaba also asked government to tarmac Teryet Road, saying it is an international road, with huge economic potential.  I also ask government to renovate Kwoti Primary School where Cheptegei studied so that people can see his humble beginnings,  he said.Ms Phyllis Chemutai, the former Kapchorwa Woman MP, said government should learn to tap talent at grass roots if it wants sustainability in getting medals.  We need sports officers at every primary school so that they can help in search and growth of children with different talents,  she said.

7,South Africa honours Ugandan for fight against apartheid - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. South Africa has honoured its Ugandan-born citizen, Mr Amii Omara-Otunnu, for spearheading the fight against apartheid.Mr Otunnu, who was recognised for his active engagement in South African affairs dating back to his student days at Harvard University, is among the few outstanding South African citizens and foreign nationals set to be bestowed with the National Orders on April 25.The National Orders are the highest awards that South Africa bestows on its citizens and members of the international community who have contributed meaningfully towards making the country a free, democratic and successful nation.Dr Cassius Lubisi, the chancellor of the National Orders, made the announcement. The six national orders are the Order of Mendi, Order of the Baobab, Order of Ikhamanga, Order Mapungubwe, Order of Luthuli and Order of the Companions of OR Tambo, which President Cyril Ramaphosa will bestow on recipients at a ceremony in Pretoria.Mr Otunnu will be bestowed in the silver category jointly with Klaas de Jonge of the Netherlands, Khotso Makhulu (United Kingdom), Paulette Pierson-Mathy (Belgium), and Lucia Raadschelders (posthumous - The Netherlands).Dr Lubisi unveiled the recipients  who have contributed to the struggle for democracy, nation-building and building democracy and human rights .Other notable recipients are Environmental Affairs minister Edna Molewa, artiste Yvonne Chaka Chaka and veteran journalist Mathatha Tsedu. In an interview, Mr Otunnu said the award is an indication that the leadership in South Africa is conscious of the fact that Pan African solidarity contributed substantially to the success of the struggle against apartheid and progressive developments in post-apartheid South Africa.In the late 1970s, as a student representative on Harvard s Shareholders Responsibility Committee, Mr Otunnu spearheaded a successful campaign for the university to divest from apartheid South Africa. As a graduate student leader both at the London School of Economics and Oxford University in the 1980s, he led campaigns for the release of Nelson Mandela from prison back home in South Africa.  At the LSE, I nominated Nelson Mandela to be appointed chancellor of London University. This was a strategy to bring attention to Mandela s unjust imprisonment and to the human rights violation in apartheid South Africa,  Mr Otunnu said.After the election of Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Mr Otunnu established a partnership between the African National Congress (ANC) and the University of Connecticut. The partnership offered more than 15 scholarships to South African students and carried out a oral history project to document the struggle against apartheid.

8,Government starts degazetting two forest reserves in Busoga - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Government has directed degazetting parts of Bukaleba Forest and South Busoga reserve, a move it says is aimed at settling hundreds of  landless Ugandans,  Daily Monitor has learnt.The National Environment Management Authority [Nema], is taking the lead alongside the National Forestry Authority and the Lands ministry ----all acting on the orders of President Museveni, in fulfilment of his presidential pledge during the 2011 presidential campaigns, to give landless residents of Mayuge District land. Lands surveyors were here last week and we agreed that surveying and demarcation of the forests starts immediately. This is a presidential directive and we are going to hold sensitisation meetings in the 48 villages,  Mr James Shilaku, the Mayuge District Resident District Commissioner, said on Wednesday. We have to end the conflict between communities and NFA for good,  he added. Communities and NFA have for long fought over ownership of the said forests.Locals say the colonial government took over their land and relocated them to other parts of the country after the area was infested with tsetse flies in the 1950s. After the government successfully killed the flies that cause sleeping sickness, some people started returning although NFA disputes this account and argues that Bukaleba was first gazetted in 1932 as a natural forest measuring about 1,000 hectares. On Wednesday, Dr Tom Okurut, the Nema executive director, led his team and local leaders to different sites where the Authority is undertaking a physical boundary demarcation exercise of Lake Victoria, which borders South Busoga central reserve. The presidential pledge still stands [to degazate part of the forests] and our work is to guide the process. It is important that the buffer zone [of Lake Victoria] is protected and it is not only good for the lake but for the district [in terms of tourism and fishing activities],  Dr Okurut said while addressing residents at Mayuge District council.Degazetting the said forests will be a big blow to conservation efforts in a country whose forest cover is dwindling rapidly according to environmentalists. A 2017 Joint Water and Environment Sector Review Report indicates that the country s forest cover now stands at just 9 per cent. This represents a 3 per cent drop in a period of two years.Dr Mary Goretti Kitutu, the State minister for Environment, says there is a direct correlation between forest cover and the amount of rainfall received in an area. She says 40 per cent of rainfall received in Uganda is due to forests, wetlands and other natural features.However, Ms Zariata Namaganda, a Mayuge District councillor, says resettling citizens should be a priority and it is aimed at correcting the colonial injustices. There was sleeping sickness here and colonialists relocated people and planted a forest. Now the owners are claiming ownership of the land,  Ms Namaganda said.Hadambi Twalimbu, a resident said:  I have been here for15 years, it feels good that we are finally getting land. We could not plan for our families because we did not have ownership of land. Ms Sarah Naigaga, the Nema lawyer, said they are following the law and it is Parliament that will finally degazette the forests.Section 8 of the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act 2003 requires any degazettement to have the blessing of Parliament.ResettlementIt is estimated that 30,000 people will be resettled in Bukaleba forest, which currently measures 8,000 hectares and other Ugandans will be settled in the South Busoga forest, which measures 16,382 hectares.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-starts-degazetting-two-forest-reserves-Busoga/688334-5067930-nmsdcoz/index.html,/static/img/post8.png
9,Pope hopes for South Sudan peace as leaders end Vatican retreat - Daily Monitor,"Pope Francis called Thursday for warring South Sudanese factions to respect the latest armistice after a two-day Vatican retreat aimed at shoring up the fragile peace.""I express my heartfelt hope that hostilities will finally cease, that the armistice will be respected,"" the pope told President Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar at the Vatican. The pontiff said he hoped ""that political and ethnic divisions will be surmounted, and that there will be a lasting peace for the common good of all those citizens who dream of beginning to build the nation"".The arch-rivals last saw each other in October last year, shortly after the signing of a power-sharing deal, when Machar made a brief return to Juba for the first time since fleeing on foot in a hail of gunfire in July 2016.Machar was Kiir's vice president until a falling out in 2013 which kickstarted a civil war just two years after independence from Sudan.Battles between those from Machar's Nuer community and Kiir's Dinka people were characterised by brutal violence, rape and UN warnings about ""ethnic cleansing"".The meeting between the two men had been billed as ""an occasion for encounter and reconciliation, in a spirit of respect and trust,"" the Vatican said, describing it as ""both ecumenical and diplomatic at the same time"".After the retreat, the pope kissed the South Sudanese leaders' feet, saying: ""Your people is awaiting your return to your country, the reconciliation of all its members, and a new era of peace and prosperity for all.""""People are wearied, exhausted by past conflicts: remember that with war, all is lost! Your people today are yearning for a better future, which can only come about through reconciliation and peace.""In 2015 a peace deal was signed that saw Machar return as vice president in 2016, but the deal collapsed within months, with fierce battles in the capital. The fresh conflict engulfed even more of the country.Machar fled on foot to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and went into exile in South Africa and later Sudan which played a key role in the latest peace deal.The power-sharing agreement will again reinstate Machar as vice-president, and the unity government is meant to be in place in May, however, observers warn implementation of the deal has stalled.Crucially, the two men have yet to negotiate security control of the capital, moves to establish a national army, and other sticking points. Several ceasefire agreements and peace pacts have failed to end the fighting, which has led to the death of an estimated 380,000 people, uprooted a third of the population, forced nearly two-and-a-half million into exile, and triggered bouts of deadly famine.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Pope-hopes-for-South-Sudan-peace-leaders-end-Vatican-retreat/688334-5067790-8nwemtz/index.html,/static/img/post9.png
10,Sudan joy turns to anger for 'hoodwinked' protesters - Daily Monitor,"Jubilation in Khartoum that Sudan's era of iron-fisted rule by Omar al-Bashir was ending Thursday quickly soured when protesters realised the old regime had no plans to go.""Change will not happen with Bashir's entire regime hoodwinking Sudanese civilians through a military coup,"" tweeted Alaa Salah, who has become an icon of the protest movement after a video of her leading demonstrators' chants went viral.Excitement and jubilation began to turn to anger and defiance only hours after Defence Minister Awad Ibnouf announced that Bashir had been ousted by the army and a military council was being put in his place for two years.Thousands of people had flooded the centre of the capital Khartoum from early morning, cheering, waving flags and even kissing and hugging soldiers as they danced on armoured vehicles.But after the army's announcement the celebrations evaporated, and the tone hardened.""We are not leaving, we are not leaving. Just fall and that's all,"" some protesters in front of the army headquarters began chanting.Demonstrators began re-erecting make-shift checkpoints set up on several streets leading to the sprawling complex, which earlier in the day had been dismantled after an unprecedented five-night sit-in.The army has also slapped a night-time curfew on the country, due to start around 10:00 pm. But as night began to fall, it remained uncertain whether the crowds would disperse as ordered.While some people had dejectedly already left the site, after standing for hours in the searing Sudanese sun hoping to witness the dawn of a new future, others began to arrive to take their place.- 'Two sides of one coin' -""This is a farce. The regime did not fall. This is a reproduction of the same regime,"" one demonstrator told AFP, gesturing emphatically.""This man (Bashir) is a bloodthirsty leader and he is wanted, he brings us another regime. This is completely unacceptable,"" added another.As activists began telling protesters not to leave the site despite the curfew, one woman in a bright red headscarf also dismissed Thursday's events.""Ibnouf and Bashir are two sides of the same coin,"" she told AFP. ""As youth and citizens we see what's happening, the government is manipulating us.""Many people were still waving the Sudanese flag, in similar scenes seen in Algeria recently where long-time president Abdelaziz Bouteflika bowed to weeks of popular protests and resigned on April 2.Gone however were the joyful songs from earlier in the day.Abdel Wahid Nour, head of the rebel Sudan Liberation Army-Abdel Wahid (SLA-AW) group fighting government forces in Darfur, denounced what he called a ""palace coup"".""What has been issued in the statement is recycling of the regime with new faces,"" he said in a statement.It seemed many in the crowd were determined to stand their ground. And it was unclear how the army, which has so far not intervened in the protests, would react.""We will not let the blood of our brothers be lost for nothing. This is a new duplicate copy of the existing regime,"" one protester vowed.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Sudan-joy-turns-anger--hoodwinked--protesters/688334-5067760-13vvyf7z/index.html,/static/img/post10.png

12,"Help local communities benefit from tourism, experts tell government - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government should find innovative ways of helping communities around protected areas earn from tourism if they are to appreciate and protect the parks, experts have suggested.Dr Dilys Roe, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), a London-based think-tank, said if communities feel that parks do not benefit them, they resort to poaching.She made the remarks while giving a keynote address into the threats to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and some innovative ideas for new community-based solutions in Kampala last week. The lecture was organised by Aga Khan Development Network. Citing their nearly two years  experience in helping communities around Bwindi tap into tourism, Dr Roe said many people can benefit from gorilla tracking indirectly through selling items to tourists. Gorillas are key attraction in Uganda. They are particularly important because there aren t many countries in the world where you can find gorillas. So the tourism market is here or in Rwanda,  she said.  That really sounds positive, but the other side of the story is where that money goes. Dr Roe said local communities can earn from tourism if they are trained to work as professional guides, sell food or offer authentic cultural experiences and not necessarily wait for the 10 per cent park revenue ploughed back by government. TrainingShe said IIED has already trained some residents to offer the services.Gorilla-tracking in Bwindi generates revenue for conservation, but local benefits from tourism are limited and the illegal use of the park s resources continues.Tourism is a top foreign exchange earner and Uganda last year raked in $1.4b (Shs5 trillion) from the sector, according to government statistics.Mr Amin Mawji, the Aga Khan Development Network representative in Uganda, said the lectures are aimed at creating  a space for conversation... a space for illumination where leaders and opinion formers can come together to reflect on the big issues of our time, to explore new ideas and fresh perspectives, and to promote new solutions to the problems that face us and our children. The lecture examined some of the challenges facing the tourism sector. Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, the Tourism minister, lauded the Aga Khan Development Network for organising the lecture and contributing to the development of Uganda.He said government is committed to conserving the environment but sometimes they are let down by rampant poverty among Ugandans, bad attitude and the growing population of people and animals that compete for space.The lecture was attended by Mr Daudi Migereko, the chairman of Uganda Tourist Board, several ambassadors and senior leadership of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Help-local-communities-benefit-from-tourism-experts-tell-govt/688334-5063750-gaoykg/index.html,/static/img/post12.png
13,Government defends self on MTN boss deportation - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. Government yesterday defended its decision to deport MTN former Uganda Chief Executive Officer (CEO).The Senior State Attorney, Mr Wanyama Kodoli, told court that the former CEO, Mr Wim Joris Vanhelleputte s application seeking a review of Internal Affairs Minister Jeje Odongo s deportation order was misconceived. He said the minister did not need any permission to deport Mr Vanhelleputte. The Immigration Act of Parliament gives the minister full powers to deport someone and whoever is aggrieved with his decision there is another option of appealing,  Mr Wanyama told court. Mr Vanhelleputte s lawyer, Mr Wycliffe Birungi, told court that the deportation order issued against him by Gen Odongo was inappropriate. The process used by the Minister of Internal Affairs to declare the applicant (Mr Vanhelleputte) was undesirable and his subsequent deportation was high-handed and or arbitrary and contrary to the law as the applicant was never accorded any fair or just treatment before, during and after making of the deportation order,  Mr Birungi submitted. ResolutionJustice Henrietta Wolayo set May 10 for Mr Vanhelleputte to make written submissions while the respondent, the Attorney General, will make a rejoinder on June 17. In the suit, Mr Vanhelleputte, a Belgian national married to a Ugandan, explains why he continued communicating with the earlier deported MTN-Uganda staff, which he says was the reason for his deportation on February 14 this year. He says he continued with communication to seek answers why they had not yet handed over office at the time of their deportation.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-defends-self-MTN-boss-deportation-/688334-5067808-9nmanb/index.html,/static/img/post13.png
14,Court orders government pay to JSC members full salary - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. Court has ordered government to pay remunerations enhanced for the members of Judicial Service Commission as they are entitled to in their terms of appointment.The court ordered the secretary to Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Public Service to pay the members  emoluments effective July 1, 2018. Documents submitted show that each of the eight JSC members is entitled to a retainer allowance of Shs19.2m every month.Entitled to full emolumentsHigh Court Judge Andrew Bashaija declared that part time members of the JSC are in law members of the full commission within the law and are entitled to full emoluments and all other benefits as set out in the wage enhancement package approved by Parliament in the Appropriations Act 2018.The court order resulted from a case in which two JSC members Christine Hellen Aporu Amongin and Rosemary Nyakikongoro sued the Attorney General and the JSC Secretary seeking a declaration that part time members of the Commission are entitled to full salary, emoluments and all other benefits as set out in the wage enhancement package approved by Parliament.Appointed in 2016 on a four-year tenure, the complainants argued that in May 2017, President Museveni approved a request to enhance their emoluments which were also approved by Parliament in January 2018.Through their lawyers, the JSC members accused the Ministry of Public Service PS and JSC secretary of deliberately refusing to pay the revised emoluments. Justice Bashaija ruled that it was improper, irrational and illegal for the secretary to the JSC not to act in accordance with the opinion of the Attorney General (AG) who is by law the principal legal adviser of government.The court also faulted the JSC secretary for employing a private lawyer instead of seeking services of the AG who is mandated to represent all government officers. While in the instant application, the AG unequivocally admits to the claim of the applicants, the second respondent (secretary JSC) who should have sought the advice of the AG in the first place instead contradicts the opinion of the AG based on the advice of a private lawyer. This is highly irregular and legally untenable,  the judge ruled and ordered government to pay costs of the petition.The court ruled that the argument presented by the respondents that a cabinet decision amended the Appropriations Act and the emoluments had no merit. An Act of Parliament supersedes cabinet decisions, resolutions or circulars. A cabinet resolution has no force of law. It cannot amend any provision of law enacted by Parliament which has the sole constitutional mandate and power to make laws,  Justice Bashaija ruled.He ruled that the neglect and or refusal by the JSC Secretary to pay the members in accordance with their terms of appointment was erroneous, irrational and improper. Fulltime benefits. The amount of money each JSC member is entitled to per month.

15,MP accused of aiding the escape of murder suspect - Daily Monitor,"Bufumbira North County Member of Parliament, Mr John Nizeyimana Kamara, is on the spot for allegedly aiding a murder suspect to escape from police detention.Mr Kamara is accused of aiding a suspect who had been detained at Kisoro Police Station in connection with the death of a 59-year-old man.Nizeyimana was allegedly last seen with the suspect, at Cyril Maniriho s bar in Suma Trading Centre.The next day, Nizeyimana s torso was found, leading to the arrest of Sebagyenzi as a prime suspect, according to Mr Merida Manihiro, a resident of the area.He was detained at Nyabwishenya Police post.On Wednesday evening, the MP who was in the company of four army escorts, stormed the police post and ordered police officers who were on duty, to release the suspect.He later drove away with the suspect.Mr Elly Maate, the Kigezi Region Police spokesperson says that the hunt for Mr Kamara and and the suspect is on-going.He said the case is registered at Kisoro Police Station.Mr Kamara declined to comment about the matter.This reporter understands that the suspect  is Mr Kamara's campaigning manager in Nyabwishenya Sub-county",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/MP-Kamara-murder-suspect-Kisoro-Maate-police-/688334-5068040-4j30l5z/index.html,/static/img/post15.png
16,"Keep money out of politics, government told - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Demands for the government and other political actors to end the monetisation of politics dominated debate yesterday during the National Symposium on election financing at Speke Resort, Munyonyo in Kampala.The symposium, organised by ActionAid Uganda, Alliance for Financial Monitoring (ACFIM) and The Alternative, which are civil society organisations (CSOs), was held under the theme;  Commercialised Electoral Processes as Barrier to Democratic Dispensation in Africa .The CSOs stated that about Shs2.4 trillion was spent by the different political parties and independent candidates in the campaigns for the 2016 elections, something they say influences the choices the voters make.Ms Donah Ankunda from Rwampara County in Mbarara District revealed that in 2016, she voted against a candidate who had facilitated her journey from Kampala to the village polling station and went for one she thought had ideas. I was given money to travel from Kampala to vote someone but I decided to vote for Kyamadidi [former Rwampara MP] because I thought he had ideas but many people voted in favour of those who provided money,  she said.Mr Jonathan Tundulu, the Kyambogo University guild president, said political parties have been funding their candidates in university elections, urging students to defeat this by sticking to the cause of finding a good leader. The guest speaker, Prof PLO Lumumba, the head of Kenya School of Law, said political offices in Uganda have been turned into money making places but argued that voters need to be sensitised to demand for services instead of campaign money.  Getting elected into political office is now a guarantee that things will come because in Africa, a politician is a gatekeeper, a tax collector and so on. Parliament should not be a place of thieves because it is a holy place,  Prof Lumumba said.He urged the electorate to abandon their  appetite for things they have not worked for , arguing that when a politician spends more than the expected salary for the entire term of office on campaigns, he or she strives to reap whatever they injected in campaigns. However, renowned pan Africanist Kaihura Nkuba argued that campaign financing is the only way poor citizens have their needs catered for. We should not have a crisis in politics because of money. Our people need wealth so that they get dignity but the governments have given up on them. If leaders increase taxes to have money for their big salaries, why would people not demand for money to elect them   said Dr Nkuba.Kasese Woman MP Winfred Kiiza asked the Electoral Commission to always publicise campaign expenditures of political parties, the source of the money and the audited books of accounts.Democratic Party president general Norbert Mao said there is a need to empower the citizens to demand what they want by voting for the right candidates despite receiving money from their rivals.One of the founders of the Alliance for National Transformation, Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu, urged the voters to replicate the vigilance exercised in the parliamentary by-elections in Bugiri, Arua and Jinja municipalities and vote for values despite the money poured in the areas by the ruling NRM.NRM electoral commission chairperson Tanga Odoi said the ruling party should not be blamed for using money in politics, saying campaign financing is used by individuals and parties to compete.  If you don t have money, don t join politics; don t start a political party that will compete with those that have money. The excess of it is what should be curtailed,  he said.EC legal officer Jennifer Angeyo said they tried to educate the masses against the use of money in politics but the population has treated  bribery as a norm .[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Keep-money-out-of-politics-government-told/688334-5067656-7n6ik1/index.html,/static/img/post16.png
17,Museveni directs on stalled Luweero district office block - Daily Monitor,"Luwero. President Museveni has directed the Minister for Local Government to schedule the stalled construction of Luweero District administration block, Daily Monitor has established.In a letter dated March 25 signed by the Principal Private Secretary to the President, Ms Molly Kamukama, the minister for Local Government was directed to scrutinise a letter written by the Luweero District chairperson, Mr Ronald Ndawula, complaining about a delayed presidential pledge in constructing the district offices that had not been fulfilled for more than two decades. This is to inform you that his Excellency the President directed that you bring the matter of the Luweero District headquarters  building to Cabinet for discussion. The purpose of this letter is to therefore communicate the directive for your management,  Ms Kamukama s letter to the minister reads in part.Official records at Luweero District offices indicate the district administration block construction pledge is among the unfulfilled pledges made by the President to the people of Luweero 27 years ago. For the district headquarter block, it was not only a pledge, but a compensation which I believe Luweero deserved,  Mr Ndawula said in an interview on Tuesday.While touring government projects in Luweero District in 1991, President Museveni pledged to have Luweero District compensated through construction of a modern office block to house the district administration headquarters. The pledge was in response to concerns raised by the district leaders about the buildings that were taken over by the army.Efforts by Luweero leaders to make a follow-up on the district headquarter building pledge have never yielded fruit despite the repeated reminders.Mr Ndawula said Luweero has become a laughing stock with many Opposition politicians castigating the NRM ruling government for neglecting the area.Luweero was the epicentre of the five-year guerrilla war that ushered Mr Museveni s government to power in 1986 and the area has largely been loyal to Mr Museveni through contributing to his vote pool and electing ruling party representatives at various levels. We have no direct answers to give to our opponents when they use the unfulfilled pledges as a political capital to undermine the efforts by President Museveni to transform Uganda and the people of Luweero. We are happy that for the first time, the President is making a direct intervention to have this matter put to rest,  Mr Ndawula said.In 2008, the then district chairperson, Mr Abdul Nadduli, currently serving as Minister without Portfolio, said government through the Office of the Prime Minister had requested Luweero District to come up with a detailed plan and documentation on the presidential pledge for the office block so that government comes up with a formal plan. By the time Mr Nadduli left office in 2015, government had not yet responded.Last year, the district authorities mobilised for construction materials from well-wishers and friends of Luweero to embark on the construction of Shs4.5b office block. More than Shs200m was raised to have the foundation of the office block. However, construction works have stalled for more than 9 months with the district leaders complaining over lack of funds to continue with the project.A 2015 report by the parliamentary Committee on Government Assurances indicated that the President had not delivered on 817 pledges since coming to power in 1986.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Museveni-directs-stalled-Luweero-district-office-block/688334-5067820-m28oh7z/index.html,/static/img/post17.png
18,Njeru vendors resort to buckets to answer nature s call - Daily Monitor,"Buikwe. Vendors and taxi operators at Nile Market and Nile Taxi Park in Njeru Municipality, Buikwe District, have resorted to using buckets to ease themselves due to the poor state of the lavatory facilities.They claim the existing toilet, which serves more than 1000 people is in a sorry state and any attempts to use it exposes them to diseases.Mr Shaban Kalulu, an attendant, who has worked at the toilet for more than 10 years, says the number of vendors and taxi operators using the facility has drastically reduced due to its poor state.He said the flushing system is no longer functioning and it requires a lot of water to keep the toilet clean. The toilet is also near a garbage collection point which creates a pungent smell in the area. What most people are doing now, especially vendors, is that they put a bucket inside their stalls, into which they urinate. They later mix the faecal matter with water to disguise it and then pour it out in the garbage pits every evening,  he said on Wednesday.Mr Kalulu said it was high time the municipal authorities constructed a new public toilet in the area to avoid an outbreak of diseases. We need a new toilet facility because the population of Njeru has grown over time,  Mr Kalulu said.InfectionMs Zainah Mutesi, a vendor at Nile Market, said she repeatedly suffered complications and only got a relief when she stopped using the toilet. I got some infection which persisted for many months and that is when I realised the toilet is dangerous. It is very difficult to use it without getting dirty, I request the municipality officials to at least renovate it if they cannot build a new one,  Ms Mutesi said.Mr Steven Oboi, the chairperson of Nile Market, admitted the market lacks toilets and that is why the use the only available one belonging to the taxi park. We have more than 400 registered vendors in the market, but the truth is we have no toilet,  he said.Njeru Municipality health inspector, Andrew Wandira Kaitaita said they are in the process of constructing a new public toilet that will serve all people in both the market and taxi park.  It is true the toilet is old because it was constructed when Njeru was still a town council. We request residents to remain calm because this coming financial year, we have a plan to erect a modern toilet,  he said.Njeru Municipality has public toilets at every market in three divisions of Nyenga, Wakiso and Njeru that make up the municipality. However, all of them are in a sorry state.The town was elevated to a municipality in the 2016/2017 Financial Year, but operated without a substantive leadership until July last year when new leaders were elected.Availability of clean lavatory facilities is still a challenge in many urban centres. Usually, attendants charge between Shs200 and Shs500 to use toilets. If one is to ease oneself five times a day, it would require between Shs1,000 and Shs2,500 to use a toilet each day which many town dwellers can hardly afford.Recent reportAccording to Water Aid Uganda recent findings, around 26,000 children die every year from diarrhoea which is caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation in Uganda. A world Bank Water Sanitation Programme report, 2012, indicates that poor sanitation is costing the country at least Shs389 billion annually. The money lost in three years can meet the cost of building the pit-latrines the country needs, which stands at Shs1.3 trillion. Depending on depth and usage, each pit- latrine takes not less than five years to fill, experts from Water Aid say.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Njeru-vendors-resort-to-buckets-to-answer-nature-s-call/688334-5067850-hvb5q6/index.html,/static/img/post18.png
19,What is Opposition s game plan for Busoga ahead of 2021 polls  - Daily Monitor,"Jinja. Opposition leaders are drawing strategies on how best they can garner support from Busoga sub-region ahead of the 2021 national elections.For the past two months, the Opposition has attempted to make inroads in the sub-region only for their efforts to hit a police brick wall.In all instances, they have failed to address urban residents and instead had their convoys diverted to the peripheries or in some instances, back to Kampala.The former Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) president, Dr Kizza Besigye, has reportedly held several covert meetings in the area since December last year. Are you for example aware that early this year, he (Besigye) travelled to Busia District, spent two days there and nobody noticed   said a source that did not want to be named because he is not the party spokesperson.The Democratic Party (DP) was on February 20 stopped from holding their highly anticipated reunion at Jinja Rugby Grounds.The DP president general, Mr Norbert Mao, who reportedly left Kampala for Jinja at 6am, was immediately upon arrival, placed into a waiting salon car and whisked to Jinja Central Police Station until 3pm when he was escorted out of Jinja.On March 16, police in Jinja fired teargas and live bullets to disperse supporters of Dr Besigye who had just been hosted on a radio talk show.Dr Besigye, who had during the talk show, urged Ugandans to oust President Museveni from power before the 2021 general elections, was promptly led to Budondo, on the outskirts of Jinja Town, from where he addressed his supporters.On March 28, police in Kaliro District blocked Dr Besigye, the FDC party president, Mr Patrick Oboi Amuriat, and other party officials from addressing rallies at Bulumba Trading Centre, Kaliro Town Council, and Lugonyola Landing Site, before dousing them with teargas.So, why is the Opposition trying, albeit with limited success, to attract Busoga s attention Mr Kenneth Kakande, the DP spokesperson, says their game plan is to sit with other Opposition parties and front a single person against NRM. Prof Oweyegha-Afunaduula, who has since retired to farming in Nawaka Village, Ikumbya Sub-county in Luuka District, says Busoga has been a vote basket for President Museveni since 1996. He says the strategy Mr Museveni has adopted towards Busoga is multi-pronged; ignorance, poverty and containment of the Opposition by using the military and police to exclude their activities from the area.By doing so, Prof Afunaduula says, the President s illusionary popularity in Busoga is sustained. The police could be clearing the Opposition to hold their rallies but knowing fully well that they can never be allowed to carry out their political activities in Busoga. Doing so could burst the myth of a popular Museveni in Busoga,  he adds. Prof Moses Khisa, an assistant professor of political science in the School of Public and International Affairs at North Carolina State University, does not think the Opposition has a viable game plan for Busoga or for the whole country. They are consumed in petty and infantile squabbles, thus it is difficult to see their compelling and overarching strategy. The FDC cannot promise a showdown when they have a divided house and are spending a lot of time directing their fury and fire at Bobi Wine,  Prof Khisa says. On what basis is the promised showdown  As for [Maj Gen Mugisha] Muntu working with Mao and Bobi [Wine] again, on what basis and with what modus operandi  Muntu has not shown that he has built any credible and strong political infrastructure on the basis of which he can cooperate or coalesce with other actors,  he adds.BattlegroundOn Busoga as a battleground, Prof Khisa says it has always been NRM s strategy to keep a stronghold on the sub-region.A source in FDC, who is familiar with this political jigsaw, says:  Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu wants to ally with Bobi Wine (Kyaddondo East MP) and Mao but for us we are planning for a showdown this year. However, Dr Frank Nabwiso, the former Member of Parliament for Kagoma County in Jinja District, says Busoga sub-region has always been taken for granted that they cannot demand for anything. FDC is fronting a new Busoga comprising people who are a bit militant. Apparently, it is that language that NRM leaders will accept,  Dr Nabwiso says. Nandala (Mafabi) has said many things using a militant voice on Bugisu Cooperative Union and government has bowed. FDC has had Mr Abdu Katuntu [Bugweri County MP] and Mr Paul Mwiru (Jinja East MP). However, Mr Katuntu has announced that he will not contest in 2021 while Mr Mwiru s political future is in the balance because he is leaning more onto former FDC party president, Gen Mugisha Muntu, than FDC,  he adds.Dr Nabwiso adds that Busoga has a big population of about four million people and about 38 MPs, including Speaker Rebecca Kadaga, and important government officials such as Hajj Kirunda Kivejjinja. In that regard, NRM can claim to be strong with the presence of those individuals in such positions,  he says.Dr Nabwiso regrets that the sub-region seems to lean on individuals and not a united front, wondering why  none  of the 38 MPs and 10 district chairpersons can meet President Museveni and tell what Busoga wants. I don t know what they (MPs and district chairmen) are afraid of. The biggest economic activity in Busoga is sugarcane farming. Lorries carry sugarcanes not food. Instead, the farmers use the money got from sugarcanes to buy food,  he says.The NRM s top most organ, the Central Executive Committee, during a retreat at Chobe Safari Lodge in the Murchison Falls National Park, Nwoya District, in February, set into motion President Museveni s re-election in 2021.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/What-is-Opposition-s-game-plan-Busoga-ahead-of-2021-polls/688334-5067878-105b0uv/index.html,/static/img/post19.png
20,High Court halts eviction of Kabale market traders - Daily Monitor,"KABALE. The High Court in Kabale has issued an interim order restraining Kabale Municipal Council and its agents from evicting, registering vendors, relocating traders and demolishing Kabale Central Market to pave way for its reconstruction until the main suit is heard and determined.The Kabale High Court assistant registrar, Mr Didas Muhumuza, on Wednesday issued the order following application for the same by traders under Kabale Central Market Traders Association (KCTA) in December last year. The traders argued that the registration exercise was not being done in a proper way.Hearing of the main suit has been set for June 11. In the suit, the traders say the registration was not done in a transparent manner because Kabale Municipal Council authorities conducted the exercise without establishing a joint team that was supposed to have their elected representatives.The market will be reconstructed at a cost of Shs25 billion under Markets and Agricultural Trade Improvement Programme (MATIP) funded by African Development Bank.Background The Kabale town clerk, Mr Joseph Monday, on April 1 issued a notice to all vendors and traders reminding them to vacate their business premises by May 1 to pave way for the reconstruction of the market.Mr Muhumuza in the ruling said the Kabale Municipal Council has not disclosed a relocation site on which all the traders and vendors shall be operating from during the period of reconstruction of the central market as required by the MATIP guidelines.  An interim order of injunction doth issue restraining the respondents (Kabale Municipal Council) or its agents employees, or workmen to halt the operations at Kabale Central Market or evicting the applicants (trader and vendors) there from and or closing off the Kabale central market premises and or relocating the said market vendors until the hearing and the disposal of the main application for a temporary injunction is fixed for hearing on June 11 or until further orders of this court,  Mr Muhumuza said.He added:  For avoidance of doubt and or in alternative, this interim order shall stay in force until the concerns raised by the applicants in the main application are addressed by the respondents. The other issue is signing a memorandum of understanding with the applicant to assure the members of allocation of lock up shops in the re-developed market after the project completion.Mr Timothy Twikirize represented the traders while Mr Grace Ndibarema represented Kabale Municipal Council.Traders responseThe traders expressed joy after the court ruling saying justice had been delivered.  We want our market to be reconstructed but also our rights must be respected. We thank court for delivering justice on this matter. Appointing strangers to conduct the registration of traders and failure by the Kabale Municipal Council to avail us with a relocation plan has been our worry,  Mr Simon Mashemererwa, the chairman of the traders said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/High-Court-halts-eviction-Kabale-market-traders/688334-5067896-c6li60/index.html,/static/img/post20.png
21,UWA to reward ex-poachers with domestic animals - Daily Monitor,"Kasese. In a bid to end rampart poaching, which reduced wild life in many conservation and game parks, Uganda wildlife Authority (UWA) has resorted to rewarding ex-poachers with domestic animals as an alternative for economic empowerment.More than 60 people, who denounced poaching from Mt Rwenzori National Park in 2017 and formed two groups; Kinyangeya and Mapata Anti  poachers associations, were on Wednesday rewarded with 10 piglets.Mr James Okware, the senior warden at Rwenzori Mountains National Park, said the 10 piglets will be shared by the two groups using the revolving system.Mr Okware said UWA has done all it can to protect wild life but poaching remains a big challenge. We at UWA have done a lot of community awareness about wildlife conservation, used different interventions but wildlife in the country has continued to dwindle the reason why we have now opted to rewarding the ex-poachers as an alternative means of survival,  he said.He added that the programme is aimed at spreading the message to all poachers that government has an alternative for them.Recovered We have given out 10 piglets to two groups as a way of gauging whether they can manage the project and once they look after them well, UWA shall add them more,  Mr Okware said.He revealed that so far three guns have been recovered and the number of poachers being arrested has increased due to community involvement and awareness. It is difficult now to tell whether poaching has reduced at this point but what I want to say is that poaching cases have increased due to vigilance since many incidents would go unnoticed but we shall be able to measure the success may be after five years and see the progress,  he said.UWA says the programme will be rolled out to other parts of the country once it registers success. The Kasese Resident District Commissioner, Lt Joe Walusimbi, cautioned the ex-poachers to surrender all the guns saying once they are caught they will be penalised. I want you to bring all our guns for you to be safe but if you don t and we get you, we shall not forgive you because you are an ex-poacher,  Lt Walusimbi warned.Mr Emanuel Kule, the secretary for Nyangonge  Mapata ex-hunters, said:  Ever since we denounced poaching few years ago, our children have suffered from malnutrition due to poor feeding, no money and herbal medicines among other benefits we have been getting from the park.  He added:  As we hand over our weapons to UWA today, we need you to give us alternatives otherwise it may not be easy for us to stay without meat. Mr Kule said they need to get clearance in order to get access to resources in the park as one way of improving working relationship between the communities and the park.SurrenderedLast week another group denounced poaching and handed over their weapons to UWA authorities at Ndugutu Secondary School, Bugoye Sub-county in Kasese.Ms Joy Biira, 45, said they decided to abandon illegal activities in the park after the four men who were leading them into the park lost their lives.Ms Peresi Kabugho said apart from getting the piglets the group is also engaged in bee keeping for economic empowerment.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UWA-to-reward-ex-poachers-with-domestic-animals/688334-5067920-uny9pg/index.html,/static/img/post21.png
22,Concern as refugees destroy forests - Daily Monitor,"YUMBE. The refugee settlements in Bidibidi has been rendered bare following destruction of trees for firewood, charcoal and building materials.Previously, Bidibidi was covered by natural trees and harboured a number of animal and tree species. The place in the early 1990s was also used as a hideout for the defunct rebels of Uganda National Rescue Front II of the late Ali Bamuze. Since the giveaway of the land by landlords and the local government, the trees have been cut down. On Wednesday, the State minister for Relief and Disaster Preparedness, Mr Musa Ecweru, expressed shock considering the high level of degradation. He said in the last two years, the areas have suffered about 58 per cent environmental destruction.  This is in a period of two years and if the refugees are going to be around for more 10 years, the area would become a complete desert then. We want to see partners acting by planting a lot of trees to replace the destroyed environment,  he said.The occasion The minister made the remarks while touring Bidibidi refugee settlement with a team of Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) steering group. Bidibidi settlement hosts about 224,000 South Sudanese refugees. Mr Ecweru said the partners must work with the Ministry of Energy and look at the possibilities of exploiting solar energy in order to reduce the cutting of trees. A water project initiated by Catholic Relief Services (CRS), one of the development partners in the settlement at Obomori Village in Zone 5, Odravu Sub-county, where water is pumped using solar power, excited the minister who said it is the way to go.  This has been a job well done by the partners but we want to emphasise that the local government of Yumbe should take up and own this project and sustain it when the refugees have returned to their country,  he added. The minister also encouraged the development partners and the community to promote the use of energy- saving stoves and briquettes so that the environment is saved. Mr Richard Matua, the commissioner for Ministry of Water and Environment, said:  This system of pumping water using the energy trapped from the sun is the only appropriate technology we can use to supply water to our communities in this area and this technology has been used elsewhere in other parts of the country and it is very affordable.  Mr Mohamed Dahir, the head of office for CRS in Yumbe, said:  This is a project with highest yielding borehole that we have developed into a hybrid water system and it is in two phases. The first phase cost $350,000 and we want to develop this into a second phase where we shall have more transmission lines and elevated tanks so that we reach more villages.  Ms Viola Kawaja, a refugee in Bidibidi Refugee Settlement, said the pressure on the environment is too much because of high dependence.   The trees are getting depleted and we want the project of planting of trees to start very soon because there is rain now. In case peace returns in South Sudan, we want to leave the place as green as we found it by planting more trees,  she said.Report Fuel consumption. In a report done by United Nations  Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2017, it is estimated that fuel consumption on average per day per household in Yumbe District is 20kg and this translates into 3.5kg of fuel consumption per day per person. Accordingly, in a year, 223,000 refugees are expected to consume 347,408 tonnes of wood fuel and this is yet without inclusion of the host community. Concerning the population density, per square kilometre, there are 209 nationals but for refugees, per square kilometre, there are 3,000 refugees.

23,MPs urged to promote improved health conditions in their constituencies - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. Members of Parliament have been urged to support the poor health care system back in their respective constituencies if they are to contribute to achieving access to quality and affordable maternal health in the country.Dr Olive Sentumbwe, an official from World Health Organisation, lauded MPs who have been able to positively contribute to the health care system by buying an ambulance, among others, for their voters to supplement on what the health ministry provides to them. We want to make sure that parliamentarians check on their voters on a regular basis at least after every three months to talk to them. They should talk to them about their health team at the district level and conduct a meeting to review the health system there plus finding out what their challenges are,  Dr Sentumbwe urged the MPs.This was during a dialogue in Kampala held in commemoration of the International Day of Maternal Health and Rights earlier today.Adding:  I am very grateful to those MPs who for instance have provided transport and communication to their constituencies. It is a very good positive move to support what the ministry of health is doing because if left alone, they cannot provide all the needed health care services to our people because the population of 40 million people is too huge, The commemoration of the International Day of Maternal Health and Rights, was organized by Center for Health, Human Rights and Development, a civil society organization.It was held under the theme:  Access to Quality and Affordable Maternal Health Care for All Women. However, in response to the Dr Sentumbwe s call, Mitooma District Woman MP Jovia Kamateeka, who is a maternal health champion, held a different opinion. She said the allowances that they get from Parliament is little money that just enables them check on their voters but not to buy for them ambulances, a role she said is for government. As to Dr Sentumbwe s proposal calling upon many MPs to buy ambulances for their voters, I say no. This is because the allowances we get are to enable us move in our constituencies and check on our people and check on the programs,  MP Kamateeka explained. Our duty is to ensure that government prioritises to buy these ambulances because once you buy this ambulance as an individual, you have to pay the driver and maintain it. So we should not look at MPs as a government,  she addedA number of legislators have since bought ambulances for their respective constituencies to help in rushing patients to referral hospitals in cases of emergency.Most of these ambulances bare the portrait of the MP who purchased it to act as a moving bill board.During the dialogue, several women activists were seen carrying pla cards urging government to better the maternal health sector.They carried pla cards with words inscribed on them like; government needs to fulfil, respect and protect maternal health rights, a well-paid and motivated health worker equals to improved maternal health, no other should die while giving birth.Although Uganda registered a reduction in its maternal mortality ration, it is still on a higher side. This is particularly in comparison to the Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 that sets a target for the reduction of maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that globally, 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and child birth and 99 percent of these deaths occurring in developing countries like Uganda.There are a number of interventions Uganda has made to address preventable maternal mortality as evidenced by improving indicators like; a reduction of maternal mortality and the number of pregnant women attending four or more antenatal care visits from 48 percent in 2011 to 60 percent in 2016 while the number of births in health facilities increased from 57 percent in 2011 to 73 percent in 2016.Despite these improvements, Uganda still has a long way to achieve the set Global targets on maternal mortality[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/MPs-urged-promoting-improved-health-conditions-their/688334-5067958-pkkj2l/index.html,/static/img/post23.png
24,"Fun, fundraising and dance at Bweranyangi reunion - Daily Monitor","It s funny how the passage of time can erode memories, yet strengthen friendships. For Bweranyangi Old Girls, the passage of time kindled fond memories of their life in school and an ageless friendship when they held a dinner and dance at Silver Springs Hotel Bugolobi, last weekend. An air of excitement was the first thing that struck you when you stepped into Mbuya Hall, the place the dinner was held. The noise was something to reckon with. The tables were labelled with years, from the 1960s to 2017 in chronological order. Each table held a decade so the alumni from the same years sat together.Everyone in the room was lost in conversation, like they were in school again; some stood in groups, others sat at their round tables with their voices competing to be heard. Every so often, one would recognise another s face, and shout with joy, screaming their full names at the top of their lungs and warmly hug them. It was obvious that it had been long since they last met. Every now and again, an OG would pull a chair to a different table where the conversation was sweeter and faces more familiar. One particular corner towards the back of the hall would remind you of back benchers in school, totally oblivious of what else was going on in the room, but their conversation. In the background, old African music was playing like it did in the 60s, with a few people swinging to it. Dr Miria Matembe (former ethics minister), was already in a dancing mood and as she made her way to the food point in the next room dancing to the music, when it was time to serve, the whole room cheered her on with an uproar. Prominent faces presentAfter dinner, the room was called to order and it was then that you started recognising the prominent faces. The government Chief Whip, Hon Ruth Nankabirwa was the guest of honor in the big shoes of Minister of Education, Janet Museveni who is an old girl. Mary Karooro Okurut (Cabinet Minister in charge of General Duties in OPM) who was also installed as the Patron of the Old Girls Association, BWOGA graced the event. Mitooma Woman MP, Jova Kamateka; Director of the Directorate of Education Standards in the ministry of Education, Dr Kedress Turyagyenda; and the current Bweranyangi Girl s head teacher Juliet Atuhairwe Muzoora were some of those among other dignitaries. A walk down memory laneThe most hilarious part of the dinner that got the full house laughing away was then the old girls talked about their escapades when still in school. Amidst tales of how the girls used to raid each other s gardens at night and almost got caught, Matembe shared how all the ladies she had gone to school in the same years with (1964-69) were naughty,  But among all of them, I was the naughtiest,  she confessed. She recalled a time when she trespassed on the school compound because a school guard had refused them to go to the other side to check out old clothes that were being sold by a vendor. After pleading with the security person to no avail, she told him,  Let me step there and see what you will do to me. And I stepped there. The man went and reported me (to a teacher) who told me to apologise but I refused. He took me to the headmistress,  Matembe narrated.She also knew that if she was taken to the headmistress, she would be dismissed from the school because she had a lot of naughty cases piled up. You see, we were all saved, singing in the chapel and dancing for the Lord, so when I went in, the head teacher said,  Koburunga, we gave you a last warning, this was your last chance. I told you I would take you back to your mother.  All of a sudden, I don t know whether it was the Holy Spirit or what but a word that Paul says came to me that,  What I want to do, is not what I do and then I do what I don t want to do and when I do it, it is not me, but the devil in me.  And the headmistress, took it seriously and she said,  Oh dear!  She prayed for me, beat the Satan out of me and let me go. But can you imagine, when I walked out, people were waiting for me around the corner to hear my predicament. I said she forgave me. So, we went and found that guard and said,  Shame on you   and when I think about that, I just say, God is good,  she said to the amusement and raucous laughter of her fellow OGs. Ms Museveni in her message, noted that  I have no doubt that we all cherish the memories of the time we spent in the Bweranyangi chapel during the Scripture Union fellowships and the Sunday services. Some of the hymns that we sung with innocent passion have now become our source of encouragement during real life trials. I therefore support this venture and believe that together we can make this project a reality.  The group had last got together formally, during preparation of the centenary celebrations, in 2012 which partly explains why this dinner was important. On top of catching up, a new patron of the association was installed, a strategic work plan of 2019-2022 launched, and a fundraiser for construction of a school chapel held. Spearheading the fundraiser was Hon Nankabirwa who opened up by delivering the first family s Shs50million contribution (Shs20million from the First Lady, and Shs30million from the President). There was also auctioning of two pictures of the proposed chapel. One was bought at Shs8million for the First Lady and the other at Shs10million for the President. The audience also took pledge cards.The day was them crowned by a dance which opened with a Lingala song and it goes without saying that this made the crowd get out of control on the dance floor. In an instant, the hall had turned into a dance club. When asked how the evening had gone, Dr Turyagyenda said,  It was wonderful! It is not every day when you get the whole horizon of Old Girls from the 60s to 2015; that is more than 50 years. I really had to strive and come. She said she was also proud of the core values that one picks just passing through Bweranyangi.  Hard work, integrity, the fear of God, committed to work, ability to produce results  and that is very exciting,  she proudly noted.

25,Health workers lay down tools over lack of water at Health Centre - Daily Monitor,"Moroto. Medical personnelattached to Kakingol Health Centre III in Katikekile Sub County, Moroto District on Monday laid down their tools protesting lack of clean water at the facility, leaving patients helpless.Ms Grace Angolere, one of the health workers said for the last two years, they have been sharing water with animals, putting their lives in danger. There is no water at the health facility, sometimes we send patients to go and fetch water from the river which is two kilometres from here, to be able to clean the health centre,  she said.Ms Angolere added that sometimes in the maternity ward, mothers after delivering, they just cover blood with sand because of lack of water to clean the ward.Ms Betty Aketch, another nurse said they will only return to work when water is connected to the health facility.  Life at Kakingol health centre is difficult, we survive on dirty water that we share with animals and even getting that water it s very difficult because of the long distance,  she said.Mr Timothy Okiror, the health in charge at Kakingol said they were using rain water but because of the prolonged draught, all water tanks have dried up. Patients and more especially expectant mothers come with water from their homes, but it s still not enough,  he said.Mr Michael Akol, the area LCIII chairperson said:  Despite our efforts to report the matter to relevant authorities, no action has been taken. The Moroto District Health Officer, Mr Andrew Ilukol, said the staff have the right to access clean water and they were right to lay down tools to save their lives. We have talked about this issue and its now beyond us. Much as we (the medical people) are trying our best to treat people, we can t do much without clean water,  he said.In September last, after a public outcry about the same issue, a team from the ministry of water led by the Assistant Commissioner Internal Audit, Mr Charles Oryema visited Kakingol Health Centre III and promised to provide clean within three months, but not action has ever taken place.READ:Patients now use sand to  clean  maternity ward",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Health-workers-lay-down-tools-lack-watera-Health-Centre/688334-5067264-10tphwfz/index.html,/static/img/post25.png
26,Kabale market traders demand extension of eviction deadline - Daily Monitor,"Kabale. A section of traders operating in Kabale Central Market have asked the authorities to give them three more months to vacate the market ahead of its reconstruction.Kabale Municipality leaders have given the traders up to May 1 to vacate the market ahead of its redevelopment at a cost of Shs25 billion under the Markets and Agricultural Trade Improvement Programme (MATIP), which is funded by African Development Bank.However, the traders under their umbrella body, Kabale Central Market Traders Association, on Monday said they need the three months to conduct fresh registration of people operating in the market.During a meeting convened by the town clerk, Mr Joseph Monday, and addressed by the mayor, Mr Sentaro Byamugisha, and the MATIP facilitator, Mr Emmanuel Mwebaze, the traders said the first registration exercise was not transparent as it was conducted by intruders. We want our market reconstructed but our rights as traders holding occupation permits must be observed. We also need the municipal council to issue written documents, confirming that all lock up owners and venders shall retain ownership of their lockups and operation spaces they have been occupying after reconstruction,  said Mr Simon Mashemererwa, the traders  chairperson. We need also municipal council to avail us a relocation plan and sites where we shall be operating as the reconstruction process goes on,  he added. Mr Mashemererwa and the secretary for defence, Mr George Kabagambe, also accused the municipal council of imposing on the traders another chairperson in the names of Mr Benson MfitumukizaMr Monday, however, said registration will not be repeated. The list of the registered vendors is available at the Kabale Central Market notice boards for viewing and anyone with a complaint can register it with the complaint handling desk in the market. Soon my office will advise and guide you on the relocation sites,  he said.The deputy RDC, Mr Gad Rugaju, asked the traders to end their conflicts with the council authorities to allow reconstruction to start.  Government goes with the majority. If the majority have agreed to vacate their business premises, the minority still opposing should follow suit. Endure the pain for the cause of development in your area,  he said.About the marketBackground: In December last year, Kabale Central Market Traders Association petitioned Kabale High Court, asking it to stop registration of vendors by the municipal council, claiming the exercise was not being done in a proper way. They also asked court to issue an interim order but the applications have never been handled. During the Monday meeting, some traders also declined to sign the memorandum of understanding with government on the market reconstruction, saying they need to first study it and be sure their rights and interests are protected.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kabale-market-traders-demand-extension-eviction-deadline/688334-5065878-m8hi9/index.html,/static/img/post26.png
27,"Government, aid agency to resume receiving South Sudan refugees - Daily Monitor","Yumbe. Humanitarian aid agency United Nation High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) are negotiating plans to resume receiving more South Sudanese refugees at Bidi Bidi refugee settlement camp in Yumbe District, Daily Monitor has learnt.OPM had earlier stopped receiving the refugees in December 2016 after the population at the centre was estimated to be 270,000.However biometric verification conducted jointly by OPM and UNHCR last year indicated that there were 224,000 South Sudanese refugees at Bidi Bidi settlement.Mr Juliao Acacio Jafar, the UNHCR head of sub office in Yumbe District, told Daily Monitor at the weekend that the current population of refugees at the settlement camp means they are able to offer space and services to more refugees. After the Biometric verification, we came with a population of 224,000. This means the services established to carter for 260,000 refugees can still accommodate more,  he said.Mr Jafar said they are currently in discussions with OPM to reconsider accommodating more refugees in the settlement camp.Bidi Bidi refugee settlement sits on a 240Sq Km piece of land.The Relief and Disaster Preparedness State Minister, Mr Musa Ecweru, told Daily Monitor in an interview recently that OPM is heading to Bidi Bidi refugee settlement camp for discussions before undertaking any further steps on receiving refugees.Survey The OPM, UNHCR teams are heading to Bidi Bidi refugee settlement on Wednesday (yesterday), we want to acquaint ourselves with the situation at the settlement. After touring the facilities and the area, we shall come out with our position,  Mr Ecweru said.The Yumbe District chairperson, Mr Taban Yasin, said the district has no problem with OPM and UNHCR decisions to add more refugees arguing that the land given is big enough to host up to 300,000 refugees.He said two more sub-counties of Drajini and Lodonga offered land to host the refugeess We have no problem with it. It s the discretion of UNHCR and OPM to add or stop receiving refugees, the land we gave them is enough to host more refugees,  Mr Yasin said.Renewed violenceLast week, 50 South Sudanese refugees camped at Kitgum Police Station in Kitgum District after fleeing from renewed threats of violence from the neighbouring Imatong state in South Sudan. The refugees included 45 children and five adults.

28,Leaders suspend fishing on Lake Kyoga for 2 months - Daily Monitor,"Nakasongola. Leaders in districts sharing Lake Kyoga have suspended fishing activities for two months to allow the Fisheries Protection Unit (FPU) coordinate the registration of fishermen and their boats.The measure is aimed at regulating illegal fishing activities and conserving water bodies.In a meeting also attended by FPU, at Amolatar District headquarters on Tuesday, the leaders endorsed several resolutions, including using only the recommended 28-inch boats. We have announced amnesty for everybody with illegal fishing gear to hand it over for destruction,  Mr Sam Kigula, the chairperson of Lake Kyoga Integrated Management Organisation (Lakimo), said on Tuesday. The districts under Lakimo include Nakasongola, Pallisa, Amolatar, Kamuli, Apac, Dokolo, Buyende, Kaliro, Soroti, Kaberamaido, Serere, Katakwi, Ngora, Dokolo and Kumi.The move comes after the Ministry of Agriculture said boat owners must have the recommended size of boats and fishing gear, Tax Identification Numbers and National Identity cards. Boat owners who are not fishermen are required to first secure fishing licences for their fishermen at Shs25,000 to be registered.Mr Dan Muganga, the Nakasongola Resident District Commissioner, said Lakimo member districts together with FPU also resolved to evict residents settling on suds (floating Islands).The settlers, mainly fishermen, have reportedly defied attempts by authorities to force them back to the main land. The district security committees have detailed reports regarding the criminal acts orchestrated by those people. They are lawless and irresponsible. Our resolve to have them back to the main land is to ensure that we do not have people who live a life full of criminality simply because they are not within the easy reach of the law enforcers,  Mr Muganga said. Ms Margaret Komuhangi, the Nakasongola District Woman MP, said the residents dispose of the wastes directly into the lake because they lack lavatory facilities and garbage pits. We had failed because all the sensitisation activities undertaken fell on deaf ears. We should now rally behind the UPDF to save the lake,  Ms Komuhangi saidLt Col James Nuwagaba, the FPU commander, commended the leaders for their cooperation to save the lake. There have been complaints by politicians, including the fishing community who claim their motorcycles and vehicles are illegally confiscated during our operations. So, with their support now, our work will be easy,  he said.Mr James Oloka, a fisherman from Namasale Landing Site in Amolatar, welcomed the suspension. We engaged in bad fishing methods and we are now regretting. The fish stock has drastically reduced and our families have to look for an alternative source of livelihood. We are only worried that we might not afford the 28-inch boats recommended on the lake. The boats are very expensive for an ordinary fisherman because they use engines,  Mr Oloka said.A recommended boat costs about Shs6m and above.TrendSuspension of fishing on Lake Kyoga comes three months after local leaders from Pallisa and Ngora districts also resolved to suspend all fishing activities on Lake Nyaguo to allow communities have standard fishing gear. A similar exercise kicked off on Lake Victoria last year where boat owners are already registering their boats.Illegal fishing on Ugandan lakes has reduced fish stocks, especially in species such as tilapia, Nile perch and silver fish-something that has drastically affected the country s export earnings from fish.

29,Youth demand RDC resignation - Daily Monitor,"JINJA. A group of youth yesterday stormed the Jinja District Council meeting that had been called to approve the budget for the financial year 2019/2020, demanding the resignation of the Jinja Resident District Commissioner (RDC), Mr Eric Sakwa.The Jinja District Council speaker, Mr Michael Musana Nyende, was forced to adjourn the meeting.The youth, who carried placards written on:  Sakwa, it is now the time for you to leave Jinja ,  President save us by taking away Sakwa , accused him of abusing their leaders.The council later restarted amid deployment at every entrance of the chambers to prevent the youth from disrupting the meeting.The Council approved a Shs45b budget estimate with an appeal by the speaker to always petition his office in case of any grievances, other than using violent means.Mr Nyenda said he forwarded their concerns to the Executive so that they come up with a recommendation about the behaviours of Mr Sakwa before they take action.Mr Sakwa was absent from the Council meeting.Leaders want respectJinja District chairperson Titus Kisambira urged Mr Sakwa to desist from calling fellow leaders lucky fools, illiterate and thieves. The law mandates him as RDC that if he feels discontented in any area, he is free to write to Inspectorate of Government or any other institution to investigate the leaders instead of insulting us through the media,   Mr Kisambira said. He added that they will not take his behaviour lightly.Mr Kisambira said as an executive after their findings, they will request for a special Council meeting to come up with a recommendation on the behaviours of Mr Sakwa.However, when contacted, Mr Sakwa said he would continue fighting leaders who engage in corruption and land grabbing. Although they plan to chase me out of Jinja, it will not work out because the law allows them only to recommend to the President and he decides the next step,   he said.This comes at a time when the municipality speaker, Mr Moses Bizitu, condemned Mr Sakwa during a Council meeting of calling them useless yet they are all leaders.Mr Bizitu said although he [Sakwa] has the mandate from the President, who appointed him, they also have a mandate from the people who elected them.On Thursday last week, Mr Sakwa was allegedly involved in a squabble with his deputy, Mr Abel Bakunda, during a security meeting at the district headquarters.According to sources, the altercation followed a heated argument which was triggered by a prolonged contest over stamps by Mafubira and Namulesa villages.The National Resistance Movement (NRM) chairpersons from both villages had reportedly surrendered their stamps to the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) while those from the Opposition Forum for Democratic Party (FDC) had not.Mr Sakwa had allegedly issued an order of retrieving the stamps from FDC chairpersons; however, chaos ensued when Mr Bakunda overruled him on grounds that majority of the chairpersons had decided that court resolves the issue.Mr Sakwa reportedly said he is the RDC, and wondered why Mr Bakunda opposes him yet he is also the head of security.This was then followed by a prolonged exchange of words which degenerated into a physical confrontation before the CAO, Mr William Kanyesigye, and the District Security Officer, Mr Jude Kyobulungi, intervened.Mr Sakwa also accused Mr Bakunda of mobilising residents, councillors, the media, and mafias to fight him, citing an incident at Spire Road Primary School when residents stopped him from addressing them during a meeting aimed at resolving grabbing of the school s land.On December 5, 2018, Mr Sakwa survived being beaten by the councillor representing Jinja Central Division, Mr Meddie Mbentyo, after he allegedly referred to councillors as  thieves  during a district council meeting.About SakwaMr Sakwa was once deputy RDC for Jinja but was transferred to Kumi District in 2016 after questioning the alleged money collected from factories in Jinja by some leaders to fund the National Independence Day celebrations held in Luuka District in 2016 yet government had released the money.While still serving as the Jinja deputy RDC, Mr Sakwa was known for arresting medical workers involved in extortion of money from patients and also steal government drugs.Mr Sakwa, who was once a diehard of Uganda Peoples Congress Party before crossing to the NRM, returned to Jinja in 2018 after being appointed by the President as a full RDC deputised by Mr Bakunda.However, after the last week s scuffle, Mr Bakunda was transferred to Kalangala District and replaced by Ms Hanifa Kaladi.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Youth-demand-RDC-resignation/688334-5065956-n2ewa7/index.html,/static/img/post29.png
30,"Protect children rights amid cultural norms, says activist - Daily Monitor","Buyende/Kamuli. The  marriage  of two minors in Buyende District has sparked uproar and a call to protect children s rights.Last week, a nine-year-old boy and six-year-old girl, both allegedly born with two teeth - got  married  at a ceremony in Nakapyata, drawing mixed reactions from the public.Mr Robert Wafula, the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) project coordinator, said the children should enjoy their rights and protection despite cultural connotations.CEDAW is an international treaty adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly.Mr Wafula appreciated that the children are at school but regretted that their coverage, especially by television stations did not take into consideration protection policies. Their faces were not covered so once they grow up and abandon the culture and marriage, they will be haunted and traumatised,  he said. We call for communities, cultures and norms that promote children rights. It is wrong to call it a marriage or initiation and while we appreciate it in the context of culture, engaging them is wrong,  Mr Wafula added.READ:Boy aged nine marries six-year-old in BuyendeMr Henry Woira, the Isabalangira of Bugabula Chiefdom, which covers Buyende and Kamuli districts, said in Busoga Kingdom,  spirits  choose a wife who should be kept clean and virgin until she is above 18. King Mswati III of Swailand carries out an annual marriage (Reed Dance) where he is mandated to choose a virgin, often young. Aware that culture grows, Busoga blends the traditional and modern positive values and has partnered with both government and NGOs to fight child marriages, domestic violence and western invasion,  he said.Mr Woira denied reports that the children are married or sleep together in coital relationship but only carry traditional visits to their respective families, get introduced to their spirits and are encouraged to complete school.  Traditionally arranged marriages monitor virginity, keep closer relations and later bring her home. Culturally, we cherish marriage readiness and purity. That is why we offer a goat to the Ssenga (aunt) when the girl s virginity is proved at marriage,  Mr Woira said.He said traditionally arranged marriages are often meant to check against genetically transferred illnesses such as sickle cells.Ms Mandwa Kagulu Nabiryo, the custodian of Bugabula Chiefdom spirits, said the ceremony was a cultural visit in which the two were introduced to the spirits at Iyingo shrine in Kagulu Sub-county. Cultural rituals were performed to strengthen them since they are both children of the spirits. The marriage was planned and is being monitored by spirits. [The girl] will continue living with her parents until she has made 18 years then they come together as husband and wife,  Ms Nabiryo said. She said in the past, parents would  book  daughters-in-law in advance and tie a red cloth around their wrists as a sign of engagement, with vows to keep them virgins.BACKGROUNDIn December 2013, a six-months-old girl  introduced  her three-year-old fianc  to her parents in Kamwokya-Namata Village, Buyengo Sub-county in Jinja District. A memorandum of understanding was reached with the boy s entourage accepting to pay the  dowry  of 48 cows, 48 goats, 48 chicken and 48 pots of malwa (local millet brew), among others, as instructed by Nambi s clan. The boy was allegedly born with two grown teeth in his lower jaw while holding a handful of two-root (herbs) grains in the right hand. When he was six months old, his clan oracle broke the news that his  wife-to-be , known as Nambi, was to be born three years later. In May 2013, the girl was reportedly born with two mature teeth in the lower jaw and  spoke  on delivery.Shocked, the parents went home and broke the news, much to the shock and awe of many.In consultation with the oracle, Kintu s parents located Mzeeyi Gamukibya s home for an interaction to narrate their ordeals and the kids  similarities.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Protect-children-rights-amid-cultural-norms-activist/688334-5064184-78cw1dz/index.html,/static/img/post30.png
31,Njeru Stock Farm land woes: Authorities ask for Shs1.3b - Daily Monitor,"BUIKWE. The controversy surrounding the land giveaway at Njeru Stock Farm in Buikwe District has taken a new twist, with Njeru Municipality authorities saying they are demanding Shs1.3b in unpaid nominal ground rent from government, Daily Monitor has established.According to a letter dated January 2, 2019, to the Ministry of Agriculture Permanent Secretary, signed by the Njeru Municipality Town Clerk, Mr Ambrose Ocen, Njeru Stock Farm has not been remitting ground rent fees for 19 years. This is to submit invoice number 631 dated January 2, 2019, in respect of Njeru Stock Farm for the last 19 years in line with the guidance from the Permanent Secretary/Secretary to Treasury in his Circular No.ISS255/432/01 dated March, 25 2015,  the letter reads, in part.When contacted on Monday, Mr Ocen, confirmed writing the letter, saying since 2000, Njeru Stock Farm management has not paid nominal ground rent equivalent to Shs100,000 per acre for 706 acres.  the terms of the sub-lease were that they [Njeru Stock Farm] would be paying Shs100,000 per acre of land per annum as nominal ground rent, unfortunately, government stopped paying that money in 2000, and the money has accumulated to Shs1.3b,  Mr Ocen said. Earlier controversiesThis comes on the heels of reports that some chunk of land housing the government demonstration farm has been parcelled out to different individuals, including Justice Minister, Kahinda Otafiire. Njeru Stock Farm, located at Bukaaya West Village, is one of the government farms under the National Animal Genetics Resources Centre & Data Bank ((NAGRC & DB). It hosts a dairy model farm.However, Dr Wilberforce Kifudde Wandera, the technical manager from the Genetics Resources Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, said the money being demanded by Njeru Municipal Council as ground rent had been inflated. It is true Njeru Municipal Council wrote to us, but it s not true that they demand all that money, they have inflated the figure to defraud government because they claim money of 1950s during the colonial time,  he said, adding  the remaining piece of land is even less because they [Njeru Municipal Council] also sub leased more land to private developers, who acquired it through fraudulent means,  he said.He also said Njeru Stock Farm has a land tittle and wondered where individuals who claim to possess titles got them from.Last year, the Justice Catherine Bamugemeire-led Commission of Inquiry into Land Matters started investigating how private individuals acquired land on the government stock farm.Ownership of the same land is currently being contested between Ham Mukasa s family and the family of the late Enock Sebowa.Ham Mukasa reportedly leased Njeru Stock Farm land measuring 1,099 acres to the colonial government for 99 years.Prior to 2000, government was paying nominal ground rent to Ham Mukasa s family through Njeru Town Council, which has since been elevated to a municipality.When contacted, Gen Kahinda Otafiire insisted that he lawfully acquired 50 acres on Plot 280 and another 50 acres on Plot 283 off the Njeru Stock Farm land. Last September, NAGRC & DB executive director, Dr Charles Lagu, told the Bamugemereire Commission that Njeru Stock Farm was on the brink of losing 504 acres to encroachers. He said the stock farm was only left with 562 acres.Investigations done by the Inspector General of Government (IGG) in 2014 revealed that although Njeru Town Council got a lease on the land in 1967, including plots 2,3,4 &5, the same town council, in 1969, sub-leased 306 acres to the Ministry of Agriculture [Njeru Stock Farm] out of Plot 2,3,4 & 5 for livestock purposes.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Njeru-Stock-Farm-land-woes-Authorities-ask-for-Shs1-3b/688334-5064220-7wbre2/index.html,/static/img/post31.png
32,Masaka residents protest new fees for grazing in forest reserves - Daily Monitor,"MASAKA. Masaka District residents have protested the revised charges levied on herders grazing their cattle in government forest reserves.The changes announced by the district forestry authorities require each cow grazed from forest reserves, including Mujuzi Forest Reserve, to pay Shs5,000, up from Shs1,000, which they have been paying monthly.However, the herdsmen have opposed the new fees, saying they are exorbitant.The most affected herdsmen are those in Diimo, Katikamu, Gayaza, Nabitaka and Byambale, among villages in Kyesiga Sub-county in Masaka District.During a crisis village meeting at Byambale Village in Kyesiiga Sub-county on Wednesday last week, the residents raised their concern over what they called exploitation by the forestry authorities.Herdsmen led by the village chairperson, Mr Baker Kalokola, claim that for long, they have been protecting the forest reserves from encroachers and land grabbers. Majority of the herdsmen here are still keeping local breeds because they don t have money to purchase and maintain hybrid heifers. So, I wonder how they will manage to pay Shs5,000 per month to feed their cattle,  he said.Also under the new arrangement, herdsmen will cease fetching firewood from the forest reserves as has been the practice.Ms Joan Namukasa, one of the affected livestock farmers, said local leaders and forestry authorities should address the problem of illegal logging in forest reserves instead of witch-hunting locals residing near forests.Livestock farmers in Bukoto Central constituency have asked their leaders, including the area legislator and Vice President Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi to intervene and ask the district forestry authorities to revise the new charges downwards.The area parish chairperson, Mr Moses Gabula, said it s unfair to charge herdsmen such money for simply grazing their cattle in forest reserves.Efforts to speak to the area forest supervisor, Mr Rogers Mwanje, were futile by press time. Grazing in forestsPermission: In the neighbouring Gomba District, National Forestry Authority permitted herders to graze in central forest reserves provided they report those who cut down trees. They are usually given a six-month grazing permit, which is renewable upon satisfactory monitoring which considers sustainable use of the reserves.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Masaka-residents-protest-new-fees-grazing-in-forest-reserves/688334-5064244-15u1qly/index.html,/static/img/post32.png
33,Security hunt poachers over  killing of nine Uganda Kobs - Daily Monitor,"NTOROKO. A combined force of Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) rangers and Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) are searching for suspected poachers believed to have killed nine kobs in Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve in Ntoroko District. The warden-in-charge of Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, Mr Benon Mugyerwa, on Monday evening confirmed the death of the Uganda Kobs.  Yes, we found nine heads of the kobs inside Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve last week on Wednesday. The poachers had already taken the meat but we have dispatched a combined force of our rangers from our reserve and other parks together with the UPDF to hunt and arrest these poachers,  Mr Mugyerwa said.Other poaching incidents Just mid last month, court in Ntoroko District sentenced four cattle keepers for illegally grazing more than 600 cows in Tooro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. Mr Deusdedit Twinomugisha, the assistant warden of Community Conservation at Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve, said the cattle keepers have killed all the lions in the reserve because they eat their cows.  Lions are the key attraction to tourists in the park. Tourists don t want to see domestic animals in the park and they pay a lot of money to see wild animals, birds and boat cruise events,  he said. Mr Twinomugisha said the reserve receives between 500 to 700 tourists each year.  Last year, Police in Katwe-Kabatoro in Kasese District held four suspects for allegedly killing lions in Queen Elizabeth National Park.The 11 lions included three females and eight cubs, which died after suspected poisoning, at Hamukungu Fishing Village in Queen Elizabeth National Park.The management of the reserve continues to suffer challenges that include poaching, illegal grazing, poor road network to the reserve, poor community attitude towards conservation, illegal trafficking of wildlife resources and a high demand of resources from the reserve such as poles, firewood, water and grass.The reserveTooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve covers part of Ntoroko, Bundibugyo and Kabarole districts and also borders with Lake Albert. According to UWA, some of the cattle keepers were allowed to graze in the reserve during the ADF war to alert government about the rebel positions but after the insurgency in 1990s, however, the habit of grazing in the reserve continued. As early as 1913, Tooro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve became significant for tsetse fly control programme and a lion hunting area.It was established as a Game Reserve in 1926 Under General Notice 546 aiming at the protection of the large population of wild animals of which kobs were dominant. Other games were reedbucks, waterbucks, hartebeests, lions, buffaloes, elephants, hippos and others.The reserve covers an area of 542sq, km. it is located in Western Uganda and is neighboured by 12 sub-counties.It is a habitat to a number of endangered species including the chimps in the central savanna and the River Line forest of Mugiri, Wasa, and Nyaburogo rivers. Tourists say the chimps here exhibit a number of unique features such as digging and drinking from holes even when water is available.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Security-hunt-poachers-over--killing-nine-Uganda-Kobs/688334-5064312-11ygt3f/index.html,/static/img/post33.png
34,"Quit if you are paid less, MP tells government teachers - Daily Monitor","NTUNGAMO. The Member of Parliament for Rushenyi County, who is also deputy Attorney General, Mr Mwesigwa Rukutana, has said teachers who are crippling the education sector over the excuse of meagre pay should quit and find other work to do.While addressing the school management committee, Parent-Teachers Association heads and teachers of Ruyonza Primary School on Monday, Mr Rukutana said he was disappointed to find out that the school has never scored good grades in Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE).He attributed the poor performance to the teachers  failure to perform their work with determination.He said government teachers should stop the tendency of complaining that they are poorly paid yet the teachers in private schools are being paid meagre salary but they are performing well. The net pay for the least paid primary school teacher in a government school is Shs420,000 per month. When I was at this school [Ruyonza Primary School] from 1967 to 1973, it was performing well but now it is a total mess,  Mr Rukutana said.Mr Rukutana is on a tour of government-aided primary and secondary schools in the constituency to assess their situation.Working togetherHe asked stakeholders to keep focused and work together to achieve better results.Ntungamo District Education Officer Arigye Odo said he would not hesitate to sack all teachers who fail to perform their duties diligently. Really we cannot tolerate this habit of continuing to perform poorly at the expense of public money, therefore, we will not hesitate to sack you if you keep doing this. Ruyonza is one of the schools that got many ungraded pupils in the district,  Mr Arigye said.The head teacher of Ruyonza Primary School, Mr Fredrick Katushabe, and other teachers pledged their commitment to work for good grades. The MP and education officials resolved to meet all parents of Ruyonza Primary School on Friday to discuss how to improve the school s performance.In the 2018 PLE, the school did not have any pupil in Division One.  There were two pupils in Division Two, 15 in Division Three, 15 in Division Four, 11 were ungraded and one was in X.

35,Sudan army to make an 'important statement soon' - Daily Monitor,"The Sudanese army was Thursday planning to make ""an important announcement"", state media said, after months of protests against longtime leader President Omar al-Bashir.Thousands of Khartoum residents chanted ""the regime has fallen"" as they flooded the area around army headquarters where protesters have held an unprecedented sit-in now in its sixth day.""The Sudanese army will issue an important statement soon. Wait for it,"" the state television anchor said, without giving further details.The protests, which erupted in December, have become the biggest challenge yet to Bashir's three decades of iron-fisted rule.""We are waiting for big news,"" one protester told AFP from the sit-in.""We won't leave from here until we know what it is. But we do know that Bashir has to go.""We had enough of this regime -- 30 years of repression, corruption, rights abuses, it's enough.""Crowds of demonstrators have spent five nights defiantly camped outside the sprawling headquarters complex, which also houses Bashir's official residence and the defence ministry.There has been an often festive mood at the sit-in with protesters singing dancing to the tunes of revolutionary songs.Several military vehicles carrying troops entered the compound in the early hours of Thursday, witnesses said.And witnesses said many army vehicles carrying troops were deploying in the centre of Khartoum early Thursday.The group spearheading the nationwide demonstrations urged residents of the capital to mass outside army headquarters.""We call on our people from across the Khartoum capital and the region around to immediately go to the sit-in area and not leave from there until our next statement is issued,"" the Sudanese Professionals Association said.Death toll mountsThe demonstrators have braved repeated volleys of tear gas from members of the powerful National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) since they began camping outside the complex on April 6, protest organisers say.But for the first time on Tuesday night they did not face any ""threat"" from security agents, said a protester who requested anonymity for security reasons.That came after 11 people, including six members of the security forces, were killed on Tuesday during demonstrations in the capital, government spokesman Hassan Ismail told the official SUNA news agency.Officials say 49 people have died in protest-related violence since demonstrations first erupted in December.""I hope our revolution will achieve its goal,"" said Alaa Salah, dubbed the protest movement's ""Nubian queen"", using the ancient name for Sudan, after a video clip went viral of her conducting chants with demonstrators outside the army headquarters.Earlier this week, the US, Britain and Norway for the first time threw their weight behind the protesters.""The time has come for the Sudanese authorities to respond to these popular demands in a serious"" way, the countries' Khartoum embassies said in a statement.""The Sudanese authorities must now respond and deliver a credible plan for this political transition.""Sudan, along with Iran, Syria and North Korea, is on Washington's blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism. Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide, came to power in a 1989 coup. He remains one of the longest serving presidents in Africa.On Tuesday, security agents had to abort attempts to disperse the crowds when soldiers countered their volleys of tear gas by firing in the air, witnesses said.NISS said it was ""monitoring the demonstrations and discharging its duty according to law"".Troops stationed Sudan's police has ordered its forces not to intervene against protesters.""We call on God to preserve the security and calm of our country... and to unite the Sudanese people... for an agreement which would support the peaceful transition of power,"" it said in a statement.On Wednesday, protesters were raising funds to ensure a regular supply of food and water for the crowd.""Many shop owners and businessmen have offered us free supplies,"" said one demonstrator.Protesters have set up five big screens at the complex to screen football matches, an onlooker said.Witnesses said troops stationed vehicles mounted with machine-guns at the gates of the complex.The SPA said ""several members and leaders"" of Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Force (RSF) had given indications they would join the movement.The RSF is made up of Arab militias that fought on the side of government forces against rebels in Sudan's western region of Darfur in the initial years of the conflict.Bashir's ruling National Congress Party said plans to hold a rally backing the president on Thursday had been postponed.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Sudan-army-state-media-Khartoum-Omar-alBashir/688340-5066186-13ivbglz/index.html,/static/img/post35.png
36,Battle for Tripoli escalates as UN meets over crisis - Daily Monitor,"The battle for Libya's capital intensified as the UN Security Council met Wednesday to discuss the crisis gripping the North African country, where armed rivals are locked in a deadly power struggle.The closed-door talks in New York come a day after the United Nations postponed a Libyan national conference aimed at drawing up an election roadmap because of fighting raging on Tripoli's doorstep.Libya has been riven by divisions since the NATO-backed overthrow of dictator Muammer Gadhafi in 2011, with various armed groups and two parallel governments vying for territory and oil wealth.Heavy clashes were heard Wednesday in the Ain Zara district on the southeastern outskirts of Tripoli as military strongman Khalifa Haftar's forces pressed an assault aimed at taking the capital from the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA).""The clashes have intensified. We're afraid to leave the house,"" a resident told AFP by telephone from the area, where roads were reported to have been blocked, hindering people's efforts to flee.The violence has already displaced thousands and left several dozen people dead.The Libyan Red Crescent said it had evacuated civilians on Wednesday morning but had so far only had access to combat zones controlled by the GNA.Led by Fayez al-Sarraj, the GNA's authority is not recognised by a parallel administration in the east of the country, which is allied with Haftar.Thirty families were evacuated from Ain Zara and Wadi Rabi, a district further south, to reception centres or to homes of relatives and friends, the Red Crescent said on its Facebook page.The UN Security Council began meeting behind closed doors to consider next steps, with diplomats saying Britain was discussing a possible draft resolution.""We agree with the secretary-general that there should be a ceasefire but at the moment we do not have a text,"" British Ambassador Karen Pierce told reporters ahead of the talks.Cat and mouseHaftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls swathes of the country's east, said it had seized a barracks in the Aziziya area around 50 kilometres (31 miles) south of Tripoli after ""ferocious clashes"".It said several fighters loyal to the UN-backed government had been detained and their weapons seized.""For the moment, it's still a game of cat and mouse,"" said a commander from a pro-GNA group.""We're still organising ourselves. The war hasn't truly started,"" he told AFP.The internationally recognised government carried out several air raids against LNA positions south of Tripoli, and also hit supply lines in central Libya, GNA spokesman Colonel Mohamed Gnounou said Tuesday.Haftar's forces appear to be advancing on two fronts, from the south and southeast of Tripoli, while coastal roads to the east and west of the city are defended by fighters loyal to the GNA.Children at risk Haftar has defied international calls to halt the surprise offensive launched on Thursday.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was ""deeply concerned by the situation in Libya.""""The current military operation and advance on Tripoli are increasing the suffering of the Libyan people and putting civilian lives at risk,"" he said in a statement.The UN children's agency (UNICEF) said ""nearly half a million children in Tripoli and tens of thousands more in the western areas are at a direct risk due to the intensification of fighting"".The GNA's health ministry on Monday put the death toll in the fighting at 35. Haftar's forces have said 14 of their fighters have died.The UN said the clashes have displaced some 3,400 people.Although casualties remain limited so far, the International Crisis Group warned further escalation ""could precipitate a humanitarian disaster"".""If unleashed, a full-fledged offensive could become a proxy war between regional powers and cause innumerable casualties as well as immense devastation,"" it said in a report Wednesday.Peace efforts stalled International efforts to end the Libyan conflict have repeatedly failed.Rival leaders agreed last year to hold elections before December 10, 2018 under a French plan, but that vote never materialised. The national conference, which had been scheduled for April 14-16 in the central city of Ghadames, aimed to fix dates for legislative and presidential elections, and work towards a new constitution.UN envoy Ghassan Salame, announcing its postponement, said: ""We cannot ask people to take part in the conference during gunfire and air strikes.""He expressed hope the meeting would take place ""as soon as possible"".Haftar, whose key allies are the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Russia, is a former Kadhafi military chief who has emerged as a major player in Libya's political struggle. His offensive threatens to plunge the country into a full-blown civil war and has thrown into sharp relief the divisions between world powers over how to end the chaos that has riven Libya since 2011.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/-Tripoli-UN-NATO-Muammer-Gadhafi-Wadi-Rabi-Egypt/688340-5066152-u75vqsz/index.html,/static/img/post36.png
37,Netanyahu on path for victory in Israeli election - Daily Monitor,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was on path for victory in Israel's elections on Wednesday after nearly complete results put him in position to form a right-wing coalition and further extend his long tenure in office.The results from Tuesday's vote came despite corruption allegations against the 69-year-old premier and put him on track to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister later this year.His Likud party looked set to finish with a similar number of seats in parliament to his main rival, ex-military chief Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White alliance, Israeli media reported.But with 97 percent of the vote counted, results showed the Likud and other right-wing parties allied to him with some 65 seats in the 120-seat parliament, the reports said.The result would seem to leave President Reuven Rivlin, whose task it is to ask one of the candidates to form a government, with little choice but to pick Netanyahu.Intensive coalition negotiations are likely to follow and could drag on for days or even weeks.Final results were expected by Thursday afternoon, with ballots for soldiers and other special categories of voters yet to be counted.The close race between the two main parties had led to uncertainty after polls closed on Tuesday night and exit surveys were released.- 'Magnificent victory' -Both Netanyahu and Gantz claimed victory after the initial exit surveys that gave Blue and White the most seats.But even then Netanyahu appeared best placed to form a coalition, with both parties in any case falling far short of an outright majority.Netanyahu spoke in the early hours of Wednesday at the Likud's post-election party in Tel Aviv and called it a ""magnificent victory.""As he walked onto the stage to chanting crowds, he planted a kiss on the lips of his wife Sara.""It will be a right-wing government, but I will be prime minister for all,"" he said.Earlier while addressing cheering supporters who waived Israeli flags at an event hall in Tel Aviv, Gantz called it a ""historic day.""""The president must give us the task of forming the next government since we are the biggest party,"" he said after initial exit polls.The vote had long been expected to be close and lead to frantic negotiations to form a coalition, even with Netanyahu facing potential corruption charges.Fighting for his political life, Netanyahu spent the weeks ahead of the vote campaigning furiously to energise his right-wing base.Things can changeGantz, a newcomer to politics, mounted a strong challenge to the veteran prime minister by brandishing his security credentials while pledging to undo damage he says Netanyahu has inflicted on the country with divisive politics.The election was in many ways a referendum on the premier who has built a reputation as guarantor of the country's security and economic growth, but whose populism and alleged corruption left many ready for change.He engaged in populist rhetoric that critics said amounted to the demonisation of Arab Israelis and others.Netanyahu faced further criticism on election day when members of his Likud party brought small cameras into polling stations in Arab areas.Arab politicians called it an attempt at intimidation, while Netanyahu said cameras would prevent fraud.True to form, Netanyahu issued a deeply controversial pledge only three days before the election, saying he planned to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should he win.Extending Israeli sovereignty on a large scale in the West Bank could be the death knell to already fading hopes for a two-state solution with the Palestinians.It is a move long championed by Israel's far right.King Bibi Netanyahu sought to portray himself as Israel's essential statesman in the run-up to the vote and highlighted his bond with US President Donald Trump.He spoke of Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and of Israel's claim of sovereignty over the annexed Golan Heights.He also used Trump-like tactics, calling the corruption investigations a ""witch hunt"" and denouncing journalists covering them.On Tuesday, he continually warned the Likud was at risk of losing as a result of what he said was low turnout among supporters, claims widely seen as a bid to motivate right-wing voters.Turnout was 67.9 percent compared to 71.8 percent in the last election in 2015.Gantz, a 59-year-old former paratrooper, invoked the corruption allegations against the premier to make his case that it is time for him to go.He called Netanyahu's annexation pledge an ""irresponsible"" bid for votes.Gantz said he favoured a ""globally backed peace agreement"" with Israel holding on to the large West Bank settlement blocs, adding that he opposed unilateral moves.He sought to overcome Netanyahu's experience by allying with two other former military chiefs and ex-finance minister Yair Lapid to form his alliance.Netanyahu has been premier for a total of more than 13 years.But ""King Bibi,"" as some have called him, now faces the prospect of becoming the first sitting prime minister to be indicted.The attorney general has announced he intends to indict Netanyahu for bribery, fraud and breach of trust pending an upcoming hearing.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Netanyahu-victory-Benny-Gantzs-Israeli-election-Israeli/688340-5064858-12ngqwx/index.html,/static/img/post37.png
38,Bouteflika ally named Algeria's first new president in 20 years - Daily Monitor,"Algerian lawmakers appointed a regime stalwart as the country's first new president in two decades Tuesday, dismaying protesters seeking sweeping change following the resignation of veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The election of upper house speaker Abdelkader Bensalah as interim president follows constitutional rules but goes against the demands of demonstrators, who have pushed for him and other top politicians to stand down.""I want to work towards fulfilling the interests of the people,"" Bensalah, a trusted ally of Bouteflika, told parliament on taking up the 90-day interim presidency.""It's a great responsibility that the constitution demands of me,"" the 77-year-old added.Opposition parties refused to back the appointment of the seasoned establishment insider and boycotted the session, as thousands of students protested against him in Algiers.""Resign Bensalah!"" they chanted, clutching hand-written placards and Algerian flags.For the first time in seven weeks police in the capital fired tear gas to try to disperse the protest by students, who were also hit with water cannon.On Friday -- in the first weekly mass protest since Bouteflika announced his departure after losing the military's support -- Algerians demanded regime insiders be excluded from the political transition.Ahead of the parliamentary session, an editorial in pro-government daily El Moudjahid on Tuesday suggested Bensalah should step aside from the presidential post.He is ""not tolerated by the citizen movement, which demands his immediate departure,"" or by the opposition and various political groups in both houses of parliament, the newspaper said.- 'Voice of the people' -Three men in particular have drawn demonstrators' ire: Bensalah, the head of the constitutional council Tayeb Belaiz and prime minister Noureddine Bedoui.The protest movement is calling for a new transitional framework that is committed to deep reforms and organising free elections.Ahead of Bensalah's appointment, calls continued for the speaker to step down.""He has to resign, it's the voice of the people and the people must be right,"" said 50-year-old Mourad, an entrepreneur who will protest Friday with his two young daughters.""They don't know that there's democracy... I want to teach them what freedom is,"" he added.Algerians of all ages have rallied since late February against Bouteflika, who resigned a week ago after efforts to appease demonstrators proved fruitless.Although the 82-year-old's resignation was celebrated by protesters, they have remained firm in pushing for a wider overhaul of the political system.Human Rights Watch said Bouteflika's departure is ""at most a first step in ending autocratic rule.""""During any transitional phase, authorities should fully respect the rights of Algerians to speak, assemble and associate with one another,"" the watchdog said in a statement.Demonstrators in huge numbers have defied a protest ban in Algiers, and HRW on Tuesday called on authorities to overhaul laws ""on association and assembly that stifle rights.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Bouteflika-ally-named-Algeria-s-first-new-president-20-years/688340-5063880-euwet5/index.html,/static/img/post38.png

40,Julian Assange: Transparency icon or enemy of the state  - Daily Monitor,"A heroic campaigner for openness, or an enemy of the US state trying to avoid justice: after a decade in the limelight, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange remains an evasive and polarising figure.The 47-year-old Australian is again in the headlines after Ecuadoran President Lenin Moreno said he had ""repeatedly violated"" the conditions of his asylum at the country's embassy in London.Assange, who won fame as the frontman of the whistleblowing website as it exposed government secrets worldwide, has lived in the embassy since seeking refuge there in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden.He was applauded by transparency and anti-war campaigners for revealing the death of civilians, torture and clandestine military operations with the release of 500,000 US documents on the Iraq and Afghan wars.But the United States and its allies accused him of risking lives by revealing information on sources, intelligence techniques and key infrastructure sites, with internal documents showing the US military considered him an ""enemy"".Human rights groups and newspapers that once worked with Assange to edit and publish the war logs were also horrified when WikiLeaks dumped the documents unredacted online, including the names of informants.He was arrested in Britain in December 2010 on allegations of sexual assault and rape in Sweden, claims he strongly denied, saying they were politically motivated.Before the claims were dropped in 2017, Assange expressed fears that any extradition to Sweden could see his eventual transfer to the United States to face trial for the leaks.He took political refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London in 2012, but his hosts have grown increasingly irritated by his interventions on foreign affairs.The Ecuadoran government eventually suspended his internet access last year, saying he had breached ""a written commitment... not to issue messages that might interfere with other states"".There are also questions about his relationship with Russia, with WikiLeaks identified in Robert Mueller's probe into interference in the 2016 US election.According to US Attorney General William Barr's summary of his report, Mueller found that Russian government actors hacked Hillary Clinton's campaign ""and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks"". Exposing 'truth' of warBorn in Townsville, Queensland, in 1971, Assange has described a nomadic childhood and claims to have attended 37 schools before settling in Melbourne.As a teenager he discovered a talent for computer hacking, and while has pled guilty to 25 such offences, he has only ever walked away with fines.He created WikiLeaks in 2006 with a group of like-minded activists and IT experts, to provide a secure way for whistleblowers to leak information.A confident speaker, he became its figurehead -- and a lightning rod for criticism.The most damaging leaks emerged in 2010, beginning with a video showing a US military Apache helicopter firing on and killing two journalists and several Iraqi civilians on a Baghdad street in 2007.It was followed by more than 90,000 classified US military files from the Afghan war, 400,000 from Iraq, and in November that year, around 250,000 US diplomatic cables covering almost every country in the world.Facing justice Although the sexual assault claims against him in Sweden were dropped, Assange still faces arrest by British police for having jumped bail, so has stayed in Ecuador's embassy near Harrods.He has described it as like living in a space station -- he exercises on a treadmill and uses a sun lamp to make up for the lack of natural light.In 2016 a UN panel declared that he had been detained arbitrarily, but critics have said his concerns of extradition to the US are unfounded. They say he is simply hiding from justice.""WikiLeaks was founded on exposing those who ignored the rule of law. Surely its editor-in-chief should recognise his duty to see it upheld,"" The Guardian newspaper, which once worked with him to publish the leaks, wrote in 2016.Assange did, however, find growing support among previous critics on the right wing and online supporters of Donald Trump. That happened when the US government institutions with which he has been locked in battle also began to investigate the US president.""He is well aware that I thought he was waging war on the United States,"" said Fox News anchor and Trump favourite Sean Hannity.

42,Dedicated to pupils with special needs - Daily Monitor,"Maria Nansubuga Galiwango was supposed to be a journalist. That is what she longed for as a child. She thought that each of her days would be filled with an adventure of travelling to new places.Instead, after completing Senior Four, her elder brother encouraged her to become a teacher because of her love for children. That was the turning point as Nansubuga joined Gaba Teachers College where she graduated with a certificate in primary school teaching. It was the beginning of the journey into the unknown. She got a job at a school that she never thought would change her life forever.Tough startIn 2012, Nansubuga joined Hill Preparatory School, Naguru, kickstarting her journey in teaching.  I was given an inclusion class but that was a big challenge,  the 32-year-old said.An inclusive class has learners with disabilities and special education learning alongside their non-disabled peers. I had no interest at first. I was even afraid but after prayer I realised that this was a special group of people God had allowed me to reach,  Nansubuga recalls.As we sat for the interview, the love from the children was evident. A couple of them played with her while some hugged her, interrupting the session at several stages.Getting into the grooveA multi-talented teacher, Nansubuga later completed her diploma at Uganda Martyrs University-Nkozi in 2015 courtesy of the school director Clare Wavamunno and head teacher Ambrose Kibuuka. She attended several school trainings at Lugogo in Kampala which were regularly organised by Special Olympics Uganda as well as Umoja Global Community Music Therapy. The British Council also offered her an opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom in 2014 during an exchange programme to improve her skills of teaching special needs children.  I picked interest in furthering my knowledge of special needs education because I found these children amazing. They are so loving and I started seeing Jesus in them,  she said.Another dimensionNansubuga who teaches English and Mathematics, currently conducts private lessons at the convenience of the parents  homes for the last one year.Although she left Hill last year, she still goes there to conduct swimming lessons on a private arrangement.Nansubuga said she is now married to teaching even though she opted to start her private classes which she says offered her greener pastures. There are some parents who are still not comfortable bringing their special needs children in public and I find that an opportunity to reach out to them and help them develop,  she said.Nansubuga said she chose that approach because it is exciting yet she has a passion for seeing children with special needs excel. For special needs children, there s something new everyday, she says. They are fun and can be a challenge sometimes especially children with intellectual disabilities but we get to know each other. Nansubuga believes a good special needs educator is someone who has a passion for what they teach, and who you teach.  Being flexible and passionate is something I take pride in as an educator. I constantly talk to them to be able to build self-esteem. She was forced into swimming to tame autistic children who are normally hyper, especially after lunch making it necessary to curb extra energy.The common intellectual disability cases she has handled include; autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Each of those cases are handled differently and that is the best lesson I have learned in life. Everyone is different from the other,  she notes, adding that loving such children is what makes us human.Moving onNansubuga agrees that she cannot get all the money she needs from teaching as such she handles different projects. After opting to leave Hill Preparatory School last year, she joined Kampala International Pre-School in Naguru before she settled at Bourneville International School. She supplements this by working in a network marketing company, Success, which deals in cryptocurrencies. I do personal work with Success online and I never have to worry about my teaching appointments,  she says about her balancing act.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Dedicated-pupils-with-special-needs/688336-5060824-glwrmwz/index.html,/static/img/post42.png
43,NTCs should offer computer courses - Daily Monitor,"Despite computer being one of the subjects taught in schools today, several National Teacher s College (NTCs) across the country do not conduct these courses for their students. As such several stakeholders in the education sector have called on the Education ministry to consider having in place computer courses to produce teachers who can impart computer education to the learners. Last year, National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), recommended that computer studies must be taught at both O and A-Level.In fact Denis Tabo, a former student of Gulu Central High School told Daily Monitor that limited access to computer labs, and lack of computer books was the reason why students performed dismally in computer exams in the 2018-2019 national exams. We used to access computer lab twice a week for only 80 minutes a day which is not enough for a student to practice,   he said. He also cited lack of computer books that has made most of the students fail the theory part of the computer exams due to limited books in various schools. But Michael Okidi, the head teacher Layibi High School, advised schools to take up computer lessons when they already have in place enough computers and well-trained computer teachers. Lack of professional teachers is forcing us to hire anybody with a Bachelors in Computer Science some of whom are not equipped with the right knowledge of teaching students,  he said. Charles Nyakito, the principal Unyama NTC, said computer studies are not yet in their curriculum.  We have been advocating for Kyambogo University to substitute Typewriting course with computer studies but we are not yet successful,  Nyakito said. Currently, only Business Education students at Unyama NTC are taught computer, which is a small group,  he adds.Decrying the status quo, Ronald Lukyamuzi, the vice chairman Information and Communication Technology Teachers Association of Uganda, said most of the members of the association are not professional teachers but university ICT and Computer Science graduates.  Government should also equip all the schools teaching computer studies with computers. Most schools have only about five computers which are shared by 60 students and no projector to support teachers in class,  he said. Computer studies were included in secondary school syllabus to encourage practical work and skills to allow students to accommodate the changing technologies in ICT.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/NTCs-should-offer-computer-courses/688336-5060874-jfktjhz/index.html,/static/img/post43.png
44,"I do not regret becoming a teacher, despite poor pay - Daily Monitor","Teachers complain about little pay and in fact this has discouraged a number of people from joining the profession. Not for Joviah Nyakwera. The teacher is proud of her choice of profession. Nyakwera describes her 12-year experience in teaching as an amazing journey, which she would love to end only on retirement. A number of teachers are in the profession but do not like their work. I am grateful for what I am. Through teaching I have been exposed to people from different walks of life and I have been able to influence their lives positively,  she says. Born to Yofesi Ndoleriire of Rubona Bunyangabu, Nyakwera says she was inspired to join the profession by her parents who were both teachers.She recalls being taught while at home something she attributes her love for teaching to.  I always spare time to revise with my children. This helps me discover their strengths but also weaknesses in learning,  she says.Nyakwera joined school in 1989 at Rubona Primary School and after completing Primary Seven, she joined Kahinju Secondary School in Fort Portal for O-Level.While at Kahinju, she was drawn further to teaching after seeing the commitment and selfless attitude that her teachers displayed. My teachers were a great inspiration. Some would even sacrifice their leisure time just to give us extra lessons on hard concepts which we would not have grasped during lessons,  she says adding that this selfless attitude is what has made some teachers influential people.In 2000, Nyakwera joined Progressive Secondary School, Wandegeya for A-Level with History, Economics, Geography and Divinity as her subject combination.She later enrolled for a Bachelors of Arts in Education at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. This was a dream come true considering she was enrolling for a course that she had longed to pursue.In 2004, after her graduation, Nyakwera started her teaching journey at Kaboyo Secondary School in Kabarole District. She was not employed on fulltime basis but it did not stop her from doing her job well.  I used to wake up early in the morning and be at school on time regardless of the little pay I was getting,  she recalls. In all this, her joy was seeing her students excel and move on to the next level. Diversifying She was at Kaboyo until 2010 when she was transferred to Kibiito Senior Secondary School to teach History and Divinity in Senior Four and Senior Six.She wanted to diversify. And so she applied to become an examiner for Senior Four History at Uneb in 2009. This is a decision Nyakwera does not regret. She says becoming an examiner has helped her learn many ideas thus helping her get more students to pass her subject.  I have learnt how they mark at Uneb and what they consider during marking,  she notes. In 2012, Nyakwera was transferred to Nyarukoma Secondary School in Kyenjonjo District as a teacher on government payroll. She was there for two years until the administration of Kibiito Secondary School asked for her services again. In 2014, she returned to Kibiito Secondary School but alongside teaching, she became the senior woman. This, she says, made her realise that students have several issues that teachers need to address so that they are nurtured and attain a holistic education. Students have so many issues that affect their daily lives. They range from physical, social to physiological. If not addressed, it becomes hard for the students to perform well. Important to note is that as teachers, we have a big role to play in these student s lives since we spend a lot of time with them, compared to their parents,  she explains.Growing careerNyakwera is now the deputy head teacher in charge of general duties at the school. Despite teaching the candidate classes, she spares time to interact with the students and through this, she finds out the major challenges that are affecting students and finds possible ways to solve them. To get expertise on this, Nyakwera has enrolled for a Masters in Counselling Psychology at Uganda Martyrs University, Nkozi. To her, a good teacher is supposed to provide counselling and guidance to the students.Asked about some of the challenges affecting the teaching profession, Nyakwera says the greatest is teachers who join the profession as the last option, as well as businessmen who open schools and have led to unhealthy competition among schools. These business people are not interested in the kind of students their school churns out. They are only interested in instant results so as to attract more numbers in their schools. This has led to high level of malpractices in schools,  she observes.Nyakwera says for a teacher to excel in teaching, they need to be selfless, patient, hardworking and committed. And athough the salary may not be that much, she say there is nothing as gratifying as a teacher seeing their students excelling in future.Voices Nyakwera is a teacher that is very determined to get results. She is good at engaging parents so as to make sure that her students get help both at home and at school. Gwendolyn Kanyomozi, teacher She is self-driven and patient with her students. She is also a good counsellor who always engages students to make sure they are on the right track. Moses Rubalema, lecturer, Mountains of the Moon University She is strict and does not tolerate laziness. But it is her being strict that has modelled me into what I am today. She does not want to see any of her students fail.

45,Ensure you enrol for a course you won t regret - Daily Monitor,"In 2016, Makerere University students protested the institution s decision to scrap 32 courses. The affected students complained that the decision would affect their chances at gainful employment in the competitive job market. Commenting on the institution s decision, Prof John Ddumba Ssentamu, the vice chancellor of Makerere University then, said some of the courses were merged, dropped totally or restructured to give holistic training to students. He added that students must understand that curriculums are always reviewed. And while Makerere was restructuring courses, in Mukono at Uganda Christian University, some new courses were being introduced. According to Ivan Naijuka, the university spokesperson at the time, the decision to review their curriculum to include new courses was because the institution aims at giving their graduates a competitive advantage in the job market.  The need to train professionals who are whole in the sense of knowledge, integrity as well as stewardship directed the institution s decision to include new courses,  he said. But with the various changes in courses of study at our institutions, what should inform one s choice  PassionSolomon Eriatu, a former student at Kampala International University, says he had always been passionate about journalism and when it was time for him to join university, he could not look any further than a course which would offer him the much desired training. And so Eriatu enrolled for Mass Communication.  I am an extrovert and sociable person and basing on those character traits and my passion for news reporting, I decided to join journalism class. My role models are all media people and I had been practising how to write stories since primary school.  Similarly, Judith Akwelele enrolled for a Bachelors in Child Development because of her love for children.  I could not have opted for any other course as my passion for children in unrivalled. And contrary to popular belief, I had high grades that are synonymous with those who enrol for courses such as Law. At least I felt happier than my colleagues doing Law because they were influenced by their parents,  she says. InspirationOften times, students envision a conducive and favourable working environment ready to embrace them after university through the eyes of their role models. Sean Rukundo, a graduate of Procurement and Logistics, currently a CIPS student at Uganda Management Institute, says he was inspired to study procurement and logistics because of his father s success.  Having seen my father move through the ranks in a government ministry s department of procurement, I was inspired to pursue the same course. I envisioned a job market in favour of procurement officers. Unfortunately, times are dynamic and I have not been able to find a stable,  narrates Rukundo. Money factorDespite her passion for Law, 43-year-old Mary Ouma, enrolled for Bachelor of Arts in Education because she was getting government sponsorship on the latter at Makerere University.  The high tuition fees for law school left me with no option but to venture into teaching. Fortunately, I have grown to love the profession. And luckily the job market is very favourable for my kind even with the changing times,  she says. GradesAlthough some are driven by passion, others are forced to choose certain courses by their scores in national examinations. For instance Martin Kaganzi s dream of joining journalism class still remains a dream.  I was given Public Administration at Kyambogo University as my 14 points at UACE could not allow for Journalism,  he shares. Some students opt for certain courses after getting intimidated out of the ones they have been admitted to. Most universities give students a window of two weeks to if they are to switch. Akwelele reveals that some of her peers joined Child Development course because they thought it would be easier for them to pass and be free from retaking papers. Similarly Sheila Alupot, a third year student of Nkumba University switched from Mass Communication to Bachelors of Social Work and Social Administration after feeling overwhelmed.  The multiple theories and numerous fieldwork assignments in the Journalism class scared me,  she says. According to Doreen Metta, a lecturer at St Lawrence University, students need to get career guidance.  Students who receive career guidance are well equipped with the knowledge of which courses to study.  Metta encourages both teachers and parents to be involved in providing the rightful career guidance to their children so that by the time they get to university, they are sure of what they want to pursue.  Parents should be involved in exposing their children to different materials and practices that will help them make their choices. Understand your child s interest in say; medicine, and allowing them to interface with medical persons as well as be exposed to hospital environments,  she advises.WHAT THE STUDENTS SAY I enrolled for a Journalism course because I had always admired being a presenter either on television or radio but because I encountered a lot of challenges getting into that field, I got demotivated and now I just write.  Kezia Koburungi, Mass Communication student KIU We live in a world of technology and innovations.

46,"Networking, easy way of growing career - Daily Monitor","For your career to take off, you will need the help of people who will avail opportunities, know-how and connections. Just like a popular quote by American businessman and media magnate Sumner Redstone states:  If you never venture beyond what you know... You have spawned your own limitations.  To grow your professional relationships, start with the people you already know; your family and friends who will eventually introduce you to their family and friends, which will continuously expand your networking circle to a level that is satisfactory to you. Although networking might be difficult for naturally introverted people, they must make an effort to go out and meet new people because that is one way in which careers and businesses are built. TV personality, fashion designer and host of the popular Kwivuga Poetry Sessions, Nunu Umuringa Butare s career is an embodiment of the power of networking. As a social entrepreneur, her business depends on the good will of as many people as possible.  I was lucky to realise that one cannot grow or succeed in a vacuum so I set out to meet as many people as possible and make meaningful connections. I attend every event I am invited to, offer help whenever I am called upon, and treat every connection with as much respect as possible,  she says. Breaking barriersNetworks have the power to break barriers and establish the most unlikely relationships. Edwin Musiime, the NTV Property Show presenter, says he has entered the House of Lords, accessed the United States White House relying on the power of networks.  I always say that our networks determine our net worth. The power of networking has enabled me attain high levels of leverage across all spheres of influence. The Bible says iron sharpens iron; people make you a better, wiser and stronger person  Musiime reveals. Networks also help influence decision, avail mentors, life coaches and role models that are very essential for both business and career growth. As Musiime says, we are always five people away from the person we want to meet the most in the universe; someone you know might know someone who knows someone else, who knows that person you believe has the power to change your life forever.  One of my role models and personal mentor is Vusi Thembekwayo who is regarded as the world s youngest and most impressive public speaker and I met him through my vast connections. I can testify that meeting him changed my life in all ways; financially, emotionally and spiritually,  adds Musiime.Nourish relationshipsLike all relationships in life, networks need to be cultivated and nurtured or they die off. Public relations specialist Muhereza Kyamutetera avers that networks need reciprocity and integrity to flourish.  In life, we all look for relationships that benefit us either financially, emotionally or intellectually. We, therefore, seek to make connections with people that are likely to fulfill those desires. Likewise, people are drawn to us because of what they think we can do for them. So meeting these expectations is important,  Kyamutetera opines. He further recommends treating every individual relationship with the utmost importance and respect. Join an associationMost professions have an association or union that brings people together. Wilson Kutegeka, the chief executive officer of ClinicMaster, is a member of the Information and Communications Technology Association of Uganda (ICTAU).  I have benefited through connections with international organisations such as the Netherlands Trust Fund which helped develop ClinicMaster to suit international standards thus getting us clients from all over the East Africa region. This would have been a very expensive and strenuous task had I undertaken it on my own,  Kutegeka shares.

47,Suicide: What is plaguing university students  - Daily Monitor,"On March 21, 2019 Ugandans woke up to news that Arthur Basalirwa, a student of Makerere University Business School (MUBS), had committed suicide. A few hours before his death, Basalirwa had posted on one of his social media accounts saying,  I am sorry but it s too late, I m sorry too much weighing on me, I do not want to live to see another day. Basalirwa had posted several other statements on social media earlier in the month which friends were later to realise were revelations that he was going through tough times but did not think deeply about them until they learnt about his death.In September 2018, Joshua Ajuna was found dead in his room in Nsibirwa Hall at Makerere University. Next to his body was a bottle of suspected poison and two suicides notes. According to the notes, personal reasons had driven Ajuna to kill himself. Earlier in April 2011, Francis Kigenyi, 23, had jumped to his death from the fifth floor of Baskon hostel on Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road in Kampala. Before his death, Kigenyi had told guests at his birthday party that his life was worthless and referred to himself as a ghost.Yet Joshua Nuwasasira, 22, a second-year student of Makerere University Business School, Mbarara study centre had in 2012, also committed suicide after he apparently spent every penny of his tuition fees on drinking and partying. He was found hanging in his rented room in Nkokonjeru, Mbarara.These are some of the suicide cases that have been reported at universities over the years, making the situation worrying. What could drive a student who is largely dependent on their parents to take their own life  DepressionAccording to Margaret Kyosaba Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, the main reason for suicides among university students is depression. She says this depression in most cases arises from maladjusted relationships, financial challenges, stress, academic anxiety, low self-esteem, drug abuse, poor performance, career indecision, uncertainty about post-school life and other informational needs. I have had chance to interact with some students who are contemplating suicide; most of them feel as though there is no way out of their situation. They are bombarded with feelings of hopelessness, fear, isolation, hatred toward themselves and so much more. The pain they feel is often immeasurable, to a point where they see no other option but to end their lives,  she explains.How can you tell Jean Nuwagaba, the head of counselling department Kyambogo University, says when a student is depressed, they may show signs of being overly sensitive to how they are perceived by others, their failures, and their relationships. They will also show signs of hopelessness, helplessness, unexplained fear of people, places, events, or objects (phobias), escapism, and general unusual or unacceptable behaviour such as drug abuse and unwarranted sexual escapades. She says sometimes some of these people overuse defense mechanisms such as denial, blame, and projection which are also indicative of mental health issues.Nevertheless, Nuwagaba says a student in such a state can get assistance through psychological interventions such as counselling, guidance, and other forms of psychosocial support.  Extreme cases should be taken to clinical psychologists or psychiatrists for further treatment,  she says.Sometimes students get depressed but fail to get anybody to talk to yet counsellors say talking can go a long way in helping one overcome painful circumstances.University intervention Ritah Namisango, the spokesperson Makerere University, says Makerere University (Mak) has a functional Counselling and Guidance Centre. The Mak Counselling and Guidance Centre is headed by a manager who is supported by professional counsellors. The managers and counsellors are fulltime members of staff at the university. The centre provides professional counselling services to both students and staff and the services are available to help students deal with and solve challenges of living that would otherwise affect their academic achievement and their wholesome being in general. She explains that the centre handles issues such as academics; for instance failure to understand or conceptualise what is taught and failure to make the required grades. It also handles psychological problems such as sexual dysfunctions, family problems, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, bereavement, and love relationships such as being dumped by a lover, failure to relate with a lover or other people, failure to quit an oppressive relationship, as well as psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, drug addiction, sexual harassment, HIV/Aids counselling.Apart from providing students with career guidance, the guidance and counselling unit provides first year students with a fresher s orientation where they explain to new entrants the dos and don ts of university life. During this fresher s orientation week, we give every new student at Makerere University an instruction booklet, which is meant to guide them on their life at university,  she says. This, she explains, is to minimise cases of transitional challenges.But Namisango is quick to note that the attendance of these guidance and counselling services is voluntary.At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.Luckily, she adds that the unit has handled quite a number of depression cases among students so far.  Ever since the inception of this facility, we have tried to popularise our services among students, by distributing flyers to students, notices on noticeboards around the university and making outreaches in student hostels,  she explains.Why are students adamant Unfortunately, some students are not embracing counselling and guidance services yet. According to Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, though universities have created counselling departments, some students are still skeptical to go in for these services. She says some are afraid of being seen by their peers obtaining such services. It is unfortunate that though counselling is very vital for university students, some find it uncalled for and shaming,  she says, adding that for this reason at Kyambogo, they have started online counselling services to help students who would prefer online to physical meetings. Namisango also admits that though the counselling services are free, some students opt out since they are not compulsory. Way forward Biribonwa says it is high time university students accepted that everyone gets depressed at some point in their lives. However, how long it lasts is one of the key factors to determine the severity.  If depression has lasted for more than two weeks and it is affecting your day-to-day life, it is time to get treatment,  she advises.Biribonwa insists that there is absolutely no shame in getting help adding that it is important for any student who is depressed to talk to friends and open up honestly about their feelings.  If you are feeling down, tell them that. If you need someone to talk to, tell them that, too. You might be surprised by how willing they are to help you get through it,  she advises.InterventionsStudent mentors. At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services. She adds that the unit has handled quite a number of cases among students so far.Counselling unit.

48,Why you need to check that school before sending your child there - Daily Monitor,"There are a number of advertisement activities that schools engage in to attract students which sometimes do not replicate what is on the ground. And a lot of times, some aspects which may impact on your child negatively might be happening at their school behind your back. Agnes Mweteise, was two years ago convinced to take her daughter to a school in Mbarara. She was largely excited about the school s performance in that year s O-Level results that were advertised extensively in the media.But a year after, the school s performance was different and a parent had raised the issue on how the administration always advertises wrong results to dupe them about the performance.  We were surprised when one of us armed with results from the newspaper cuttings found that they were not similar to those of Uganda National Examinations Board. The one advertised in the newspaper showed they had 10 students in Division One while those of UNEB showed that the school had got none,  said Mweteise who withdrew her daughter immediately. Milton Batekateka, a retired primary school teacher, blames the liberalisation policy in education and inadequate inspection, saying education officers should be keen on whatever material schools advertise in media. Mbarara district education officer, Gabriel Ahimbisibwe, warned that schools which dupe parents risk being de-registered and administrators arrested.  Any school found to be engaging in this practice will be de-registered. It is a very bad and dangerous strategy of attracting students,  says Ahimbisibwe. Low school charges Some schools charge rather very low school fees but are these commensurate to the services or what a student or pupil needs for his career development and social welfare Laban Kanywa, the chairperson Federation of Non State Institutions in Western Uganda, says parents should interest themselves in schools that charge very low school fees especially on how they go about the costs of running these schools. Those charging very low fees are only interested in the numbers but not in the standard of education. It is these schools where teachers are not paid or are unprofessional or starve students,  says Kanywa. Every TV, radio station and newspapers at the beginning of the school s term are awash with advertisements of schools. Adverts such as  we have professional staff, science laboratory, well-stocked library, swimming pool, and balanced diet , among others are common but as a parent do you take a step further to investigate whether these actually exist Andrew Kankiriho noted that the commercialisation of education has driven schools to employ all tricks to attract students. One of the schools here in Mbarara even duped the President. It claims to teach science and technology but when the President was going to visit the school, they hired old computers, welding and fabrication machines, sewing machines and forged a workshop, imagine,  said Kankiriho. He challenges parents to always do ground check on schools before enrolling children but added that even after they enrol, parents should always check on the capacity of the school to meet their expectations. Emotional violenceUnlike other forms of violence, emotional violence does not leave physical scars but wounds the heart which lowers one s esteem, dignity, and self-worth. It includes constant belittling, shaming, humiliating, negative comparisons, and frequent yelling and bullying. Nathan Mugume, the head teacher Mbarara Junior School, admits this kind of violence exists in schools and it has very disastrous effects even to a nation; such as having a violent nation. If a teacher is violent, abusive to pupils they may grow up to have violent and abusive families. As teachers we should guide, counsel, discuss and show empathy to pupils because we can either kill or build their future,  says Mugume.He says parents need to always interest themselves in checking their children s behaviour but also monitor the behaviour of school managers and staff towards the pupils.Third partiesDue to commercialisation of education, competition has forced schools to hire private brokers and agents who comb areas looking for students while spreading the  excellence  gospel of the schools.Unsuspecting parents easily get convinced by these brokers, forgetting that these are only interested in getting paid and whatever happens after is none of their business.  During our days, competition was driven by performance but now it is about the numbers you can attract just for economic gain. Why do you employ brokers if your school is sending pupils to first class institutions with good courses   Esau Muhangi, a retired secondary school teacher, asks.This is where the trouble lies. Pupils are in schools not just to learn but also make business for the proprietor.In case you check... Security. The general security at the school and in the neighbourhood should be safe. Care. Some teachers do not have proper handling of students even when they are disciplining them. Ability to teach. This is not just about having professional teachers but those who are able to teach.Hygiene. Are the toilets, latrine, kitchen, dining area and classrooms in good condition  Behaviour. The behaviour of students in a given school can give you a picture of whether it is a good school or not. Plans. Ask about the future plans of the school, especially if the school is new or just building up momentum.Performance. Consider student performance, not just in P7, S4 or S6, but the other classes too.Games. Ensure that the school pays attention and develops learners through co-curricular activities.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Check-that-school-before-sending-your-child-there/688336-5060788-hpnsow/index.html,/static/img/post48.png

50,Cheptegei gets hero s welcome - Daily Monitor,"Kapchorwa. Hundreds of residents in Sebei Sub-region on Wednesday welcomed Mr Joshua Cheptegei, who won a gold medal at the 2019 World Cross Country Championships in Aarhus, Denmark, on March 30.Mr Cheptegei become the first Ugandan to win gold in the men s senior category at the Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Cross Country Championship. When his convoy arrived in Kapchorwa Town at 11am, business came to a standstill for hours as excited residents flooded the streets to give him a heroic welcome. Mr Cheptegei was accompanied by Mr Moses Ndiema Kipsiro, a former double Commonwealth champion, Mr Jacob Kiplimo, who took silver at the IAAF race and Oscar Chelimo, who won bronze in the Junior Men s race.Residents climbed buildings as boda bodas hooted in unison to welcome the athlete.Others sang and danced for hours as the athlete set foot in his home village in Chepchabai, Kwoti Sub-county. I am grateful and humbled that I made my country proud,  Mr Cheptegei told the residents.He expressed disappointment for failure by government to support the growth and development of talent, especially athletics.Mr Cheptegei urged government to speed up the construction of Teryet High Altitude Training Centre.Bishop Paul Masaba of Sebei Diocese said although the region is blessed with enormous talent, it remains unexploited due to lack of facilities. Government should ensure that the high altitude centre is completed so that we can nurture talent,  he said.Bishop Masaba also asked government to tarmac Teryet Road, saying it is an international road, with huge economic potential.  I also ask government to renovate Kwoti Primary School where Cheptegei studied so that people can see his humble beginnings,  he said.Ms Phyllis Chemutai, the former Kapchorwa Woman MP, said government should learn to tap talent at grass roots if it wants sustainability in getting medals.  We need sports officers at every primary school so that they can help in search and growth of children with different talents,  she said.

51,South Africa honours Ugandan for fight against apartheid - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. South Africa has honoured its Ugandan-born citizen, Mr Amii Omara-Otunnu, for spearheading the fight against apartheid.Mr Otunnu, who was recognised for his active engagement in South African affairs dating back to his student days at Harvard University, is among the few outstanding South African citizens and foreign nationals set to be bestowed with the National Orders on April 25.The National Orders are the highest awards that South Africa bestows on its citizens and members of the international community who have contributed meaningfully towards making the country a free, democratic and successful nation.Dr Cassius Lubisi, the chancellor of the National Orders, made the announcement. The six national orders are the Order of Mendi, Order of the Baobab, Order of Ikhamanga, Order Mapungubwe, Order of Luthuli and Order of the Companions of OR Tambo, which President Cyril Ramaphosa will bestow on recipients at a ceremony in Pretoria.Mr Otunnu will be bestowed in the silver category jointly with Klaas de Jonge of the Netherlands, Khotso Makhulu (United Kingdom), Paulette Pierson-Mathy (Belgium), and Lucia Raadschelders (posthumous - The Netherlands).Dr Lubisi unveiled the recipients  who have contributed to the struggle for democracy, nation-building and building democracy and human rights .Other notable recipients are Environmental Affairs minister Edna Molewa, artiste Yvonne Chaka Chaka and veteran journalist Mathatha Tsedu. In an interview, Mr Otunnu said the award is an indication that the leadership in South Africa is conscious of the fact that Pan African solidarity contributed substantially to the success of the struggle against apartheid and progressive developments in post-apartheid South Africa.In the late 1970s, as a student representative on Harvard s Shareholders Responsibility Committee, Mr Otunnu spearheaded a successful campaign for the university to divest from apartheid South Africa. As a graduate student leader both at the London School of Economics and Oxford University in the 1980s, he led campaigns for the release of Nelson Mandela from prison back home in South Africa.  At the LSE, I nominated Nelson Mandela to be appointed chancellor of London University. This was a strategy to bring attention to Mandela s unjust imprisonment and to the human rights violation in apartheid South Africa,  Mr Otunnu said.After the election of Mandela as president of South Africa in 1994, Mr Otunnu established a partnership between the African National Congress (ANC) and the University of Connecticut. The partnership offered more than 15 scholarships to South African students and carried out a oral history project to document the struggle against apartheid.

52,Government starts degazetting two forest reserves in Busoga - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. Government has directed degazetting parts of Bukaleba Forest and South Busoga reserve, a move it says is aimed at settling hundreds of  landless Ugandans,  Daily Monitor has learnt.The National Environment Management Authority [Nema], is taking the lead alongside the National Forestry Authority and the Lands ministry ----all acting on the orders of President Museveni, in fulfilment of his presidential pledge during the 2011 presidential campaigns, to give landless residents of Mayuge District land. Lands surveyors were here last week and we agreed that surveying and demarcation of the forests starts immediately. This is a presidential directive and we are going to hold sensitisation meetings in the 48 villages,  Mr James Shilaku, the Mayuge District Resident District Commissioner, said on Wednesday. We have to end the conflict between communities and NFA for good,  he added. Communities and NFA have for long fought over ownership of the said forests.Locals say the colonial government took over their land and relocated them to other parts of the country after the area was infested with tsetse flies in the 1950s. After the government successfully killed the flies that cause sleeping sickness, some people started returning although NFA disputes this account and argues that Bukaleba was first gazetted in 1932 as a natural forest measuring about 1,000 hectares. On Wednesday, Dr Tom Okurut, the Nema executive director, led his team and local leaders to different sites where the Authority is undertaking a physical boundary demarcation exercise of Lake Victoria, which borders South Busoga central reserve. The presidential pledge still stands [to degazate part of the forests] and our work is to guide the process. It is important that the buffer zone [of Lake Victoria] is protected and it is not only good for the lake but for the district [in terms of tourism and fishing activities],  Dr Okurut said while addressing residents at Mayuge District council.Degazetting the said forests will be a big blow to conservation efforts in a country whose forest cover is dwindling rapidly according to environmentalists. A 2017 Joint Water and Environment Sector Review Report indicates that the country s forest cover now stands at just 9 per cent. This represents a 3 per cent drop in a period of two years.Dr Mary Goretti Kitutu, the State minister for Environment, says there is a direct correlation between forest cover and the amount of rainfall received in an area. She says 40 per cent of rainfall received in Uganda is due to forests, wetlands and other natural features.However, Ms Zariata Namaganda, a Mayuge District councillor, says resettling citizens should be a priority and it is aimed at correcting the colonial injustices. There was sleeping sickness here and colonialists relocated people and planted a forest. Now the owners are claiming ownership of the land,  Ms Namaganda said.Hadambi Twalimbu, a resident said:  I have been here for15 years, it feels good that we are finally getting land. We could not plan for our families because we did not have ownership of land. Ms Sarah Naigaga, the Nema lawyer, said they are following the law and it is Parliament that will finally degazette the forests.Section 8 of the National Forestry and Tree Planting Act 2003 requires any degazettement to have the blessing of Parliament.ResettlementIt is estimated that 30,000 people will be resettled in Bukaleba forest, which currently measures 8,000 hectares and other Ugandans will be settled in the South Busoga forest, which measures 16,382 hectares.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-starts-degazetting-two-forest-reserves-Busoga/688334-5067930-nmsdcoz/index.html,/static/img/post52.png
