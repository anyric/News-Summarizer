0,National dialogue takes shape as teams meet at Entebbe - Daily Monitor,"The long awaited National Dialogue is finally back on track after different actors took off two days to deliberate on how to move forward with the process at the Entebbe Imperial Resort Hotel. The two-day retreat is aimed at rethinking the strategies of the dialogue and coming up with ways on how to proceed with the process,  a communication from the Inter Religious Council of Uganda says.The event that started on Monday as closes today has drawn members from the government team, the opposition, civil society and other interest groups. Day one of the Uganda National Dialogue Process retreats for conveners kick-started on a very good note with members from the government, opposition, IPOD, Civil society & religious leaders gracing the event,  a Facebook post from the organisers says.The government team is led by the deputy attorney general Mwesigwa Rukutana and includes Evelyn Anite, Dr Kenneth Omona, Mr James Tweheyo, Ms Dorothy Kisaka, while the opposition delegation includes the leader of Opposition in Parliament, Betty Aol Achan, IPOD chairman Norbert Mao, among others. Also on the team for the retreat includes members of the civil society including, CCEDU, Women Situation room, UWONET, Gliss and religious leaders who included, the Grand Mufti of Uganda Sheik Shaban Ramathan Mubajje, Bishop Joshua Lwere, Dr John Kakembo, Msgr Charles Kasibante and IRCU secretary-general Mr Joshua Kitakule and Members from The Elders forum Uganda (TEFU).Sources from the retreat say Mr Rukutana who represented the government confirmed to the members that an official communique was finalized and now awaits the president's signature. The initial National Dialogue was supposed to kick off last year, but the process was blocked at the last minute by the government. Since then, calls have come from all quarters to restart the process to ensure that Uganda s future is sorted out through a consultative national dialogue instead of using the barrels of guns to settle out political contestations.It is hoped that revamping the process will help address a number of contentious issues ahead of the 2021 general elections.

1,MPs kick out URA team over Akol s absence - Daily Monitor,"Officials from the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) were Tuesday afternoon kicked out of an accountability committee of Parliament after they turned up without the Commissioner General, Doris Akol.The House Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises chaired by Kawempe South MP Mubarak Munyagwa, was scheduled to receive written responses to Auditor General s queries for the Financial Year 2013/2014.Ms Akol is the accounting officer for URA and the law mandates her to respond to the anomalies highlighted in the Auditor General s report.The 2014 report raises a number of red flags ranging from under declaration of taxes, uncollected debt and mismanagement of goods impounded by URA officials.READ:URA officials quizzed over missing fuelHowever, when they turned up, the URA delegation led by Henry Saka, the Commissioner domestic taxes, informed the Committee that Akol had travelled to South Africa on a two weeks trip. Mr Munyagwa told the URA team that, only the accounting officer, should give answers [and] we have nothing to proceed with, unless Akol shows up. The committee chairperson and members then ordered the team to leave the committee. We are dealing with issues involving colossal sums of money, we just can t afford to sit and have a casual conversation,  Mr Munyagwa explained.The lawmaker insisted that he has been falsely accused of being harsh and that he wants to accord a fair hearing to URA.This was a continuation of last week s meeting in which URA officials failed to explain circumstances under which 9,733 litres of impounded fuel disappeared in their custody.The officials led by the Commissioner General, Ms Doris Akol, were appearing before Cosase.According to the Auditor General s report, URA seized 110,481 litres of petrol on May 30, 2006. The report adds that due taxes and penalties worth Shs93.9m were assessed and paid by the tax payer. But on the day of collecting the fuel, it was established that it was less.Consequently, a sum of Shs63.3m was agreed and paid to the owner as compensation. The point of concern was that whereas taxes were collected at a rate of Shs850 per litre, compensation was at a higher rate of Shs6,508.72 per litre.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/MPs-kick-out-URA-team-over-Akol-s-absence-/688334-5074068-12yjksi/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post1.png
2,Notre-Dame counts cost as daylight reveals damage - Daily Monitor,"Shards of stained glass from priceless medieval windows, and a gaping hole above the choir area where the spire crashed down: daylight reveals the extent of damage at Notre-Dame cathedral on Tuesday morning as firefighters put out the last smouldering remains of the fire.Philippe Marsset, the vicar general of Notre-Dame, was among the first to enter the storied Gothic cathedral whose sculpted arches have been blackened by smoke and pews destroyed.""It felt like I was looking at a bombing,"" Marsset said of the church where he was ordained a priest 31 years ago.""It was hell,"" he said, describing the moment when the blaze was discovered on the soaring roof shortly after evening mass ended shortly before 7:00 pm (1700 GMT) on Monday.Church officials raced to remove as many artefacts, paintings and other cultural treasures they could before being evacuated by firefighters as they tried to stop the flames from spreading.Flames and smoke are seen billowing from the roof at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15, 2019.But the blaze kept springing up as globs of molten lead fell from the soaring heights of the church.""All night long I saw men going past with tears in their eyes. I described it this way: It was total chaos, but we can't let it knock us down,"" Marsset said.""This church was built 850 years ago. It withstood the wars, it withstood the bombings, it resisted everything,"" he said. Yet not all was lost: the crucifix standing over the main altar was one of several objects which escaped destruction.""I'm devastated, even if I haven't been a Catholic for a long time,"" 88-year-old Claire told AFP at the scene on Tuesday morning. ""I was baptised here.""On the banks of the river Seine, hundreds of Parisians and tourists stopped by on Tuesday morning to take pictures or gaze at the disaster site, many still stunned by the damage. 'Heroic' ""This isn't some little church that was damaged -- it's the symbol of the history of France and of Paris,"" Marsset said, noting that all distances from Paris are calculated from the square in front of Notre-Dame.But in the end there was relief that much was able to be saved, with much of stonework as well as the two massive square bell towers largely unscathed.US soldiers walk and take pictures on the Pont de l'Archev ch  near Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on October 01, 1944Most of the emblematic rose windows of medieval stained glass were also spared, including the huge round window dominating the church's intricately carved western facade.""We're all just dumbfounded. It's more than miraculous, it's heroic,"" Marsset said, calling the firefighters who toiled throughout the night ""heroes.""But he appeared lost for words when asked about what would happen now, as Christians worldwide prepared to celebrate Easter next Sunday.""We had things planned for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday -- We don't yet know where to do these. It's as if our mother has been wounded,"" he said.""My bed was right there,"" he adds, pointing towards the cathedral, where smoke continued to rise into the sky Tuesday morning.""It's not the Notre-Dame (Our Lady) of Catholics. It's Notre-Dame of France, Notre-Dame of the world,"" he adds. ""The church is burning, and the entire world is crying.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Notre-Dame-counts-cost-daylight-reveals-damage/688340-5073996-nawp73z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post2.png

4,"Finance officials who  ate  $50,000 bribe sent to jail - Daily Monitor","Kampala. The Anti-Corruption Court yesterday sentenced two former Finance ministry officials, who were arrested for soliciting a bribe from an investor in 2017, to two years in prison and banned them from holding public office for 10 years after serving their jail term.Former principal finance officer John Charles Ogol and Geoffrey Turyamuhika, alias Tumwine, a senior economist, were convicted of corruption for receiving a gratification of $50,000 (about Shs186m) from a one Hassan Sserunjogi on March 27, 2017.The convicts received the money to expedite documentation for financing the construction of a power substation and transmission line at Osukuru Phosphate project in Tororo District. Ogol and Turyamuhika were also fined Shs4.8m each. The judge reasoned that the punishments were aimed at balancing the efforts of the state to fight corruption and the hardships dependants would have when the convicts are incarcerated. I am inclined to impose a sentence that would communicate the message that corruption if proven in this court would attract punishment. At the same time, the sentence would not be such as to keep away the convicts from supporting their families for too long considering that what they had received as a bribe was seized and exhibited in court,  the trial judge Lawrence Gidudu ruled.  The court would not impose a sentence that is laughable to the extent that it would encourage persons to commit the same crime hoping that they would walk in and out even after being convicted without being scratched as a constant reminder that corruption is bad,  he added.The court also ordered that the money exhibited in court be returned to State House Comptroller while the convicts be given their bail money of Shs8m and their handheld phones be returned to them.Ogol, 59, and Turyamuhika, 38, were technical officers at the Finance ministry responsible for handling issues concerning investors.Court heard that the investor trading as Guangzhou Dongsongh Energy Group Uganda Limited wanted to establish a factory at Osukuru in Tororo to manufacture phosphates and other products.The investor needed power to run the factory complex but government did not have ready money to build a power substation.The indictment shows that the investor was willing to finance the power project if government could guarantee to refund its money.Justice Gidudu said the challenge seems to have arisen when the investor wanted to move faster because of the pressure it had from its bankers who had advanced loans that it was not utilising yet it was subject to paying interest. The convicts saw an opportunity to make quick buck and demanded to be paid a bribe upfront. When a deposit of $50,000 was paid, they shared it out,  he said.However, Justice Gidudu acquitted the convicts on the charge of corruption in connection with soliciting another gratification of $300,000 (about Shs1.1b) from Sserunjogi. The prosecution did not address me on the irregularity in their final submissions. It is my conclusion that the prosecution did not prove the charges against the accused persons beyond reasonable doubt,  he ruled.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Finance-chiefs-convicted-barred-office-10-years/688334-5073340-obabsr/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post4.png
5,Egypt parliament votes on extending Sisi rule - Daily Monitor,"Egypt's parliament, packed with loyalists of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is to vote Tuesday on changes to the constitution that could keep the former military chief in power until 2030.The proposed amendments were initially introduced in February by a parliamentary bloc supportive of Sisi and updated this week after several rounds of parliamentary debates.It includes changing Article 140 of the constitution to allow the Egyptian president to extend his current four-year term, which ends in 2022, by two years.A further change would permit Sisi to stand for another six-year term and potentially remain president until 2030.Sisi led the army's overthrow of elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 following mass protests against the Islamist leader's rule.He won his first term as president in 2014 and was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote, after standing virtually unopposed.His government has been widely criticised by human rights groups for the repression of political opponents.But Mohamed Abu-Hamed, one of the members of parliament who pushed for constitutional amendments to keep Sisi in power, is adamant that the changes are a must.""The constitution in 2014 was written under tough exceptional circumstances,"" he told AFP.He hailed Sisi as a president who ""took important political, economic and security measures... (and) must continue with his reforms,"" in the face of the unrest gripping neighbouring countries following the toppling of veteran president Omar al-Bashir in Sudan and the escalation of the conflict in Libya.Keeping Sisi in power, he added, reflects ""the will of the people"". 'Authoritarian rule' Since Sisi overthrew Morsi, Egypt has drawn heavy international criticism for its sweeping crackdown on dissent. The authorities have jailed thousands of Morsi's supporters as well as liberal and secular activists, including a popular blogger, actors, singers and journalists. Last week, Human Rights Watch warned that the amendments, which would also increase the military's political role and grant Sisi control over the judiciary, would ""institutionalise authoritarianism"".As Sisi visited Washington for talks with President Donald Trump, it urged Congress, to withhold endorsement of the Egyptian president's bid to extend his rule.""Congress needs to use its levers to pressure the Egyptian president to reverse course, starting with withdrawing these constitutional amendments set to consolidate authoritarian rule,"" said HRW's Michael Page.As well as a crackdown on dissent, Sisi has overseen a military campaign against Islamic State group-linked militants based in the Sinai PeninsulaOn Tuesday, the 596-seat parliament will also vote on a controversial article which critics fear might allow the military a greater influence in Egyptian political life.The vote is expected to be swift after the bill passed by an overwhelming majority earlier this year.If the bill is passed by a majority of two thirds, parliament will then hold a referendum in which Egyptians will vote on the raft of amendments.Other proposed amendments include a quota for women's representation of no less than 25 percent in parliament and forming a second parliamentary chamber.Human rights groups and opposition parties say the government has intensified its crackdown on dissent with a wave of arrests ahead of the vote.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Egypt-parliament-votes-extending-Sisi-rule/688340-5073706-vmgxd7z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post5.png
6,YouTube accidentally links Notre-Dame fire to 9/11 attacks- PHOTOS - Daily Monitor,"A YouTube fact-check feature which is meant to tackle misinformation accidentally tagged live broadcasts of a fire engulfing Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris with details about the 9/11 terror attacks.The blaze erupted in the UNESCO world heritage landmark in the French capital Monday, sending its spire and roof crashing to the ground as flames and clouds of smoke billowed into the sky.The fire, which at one point threatened the entire edifice, was brought under control early Tuesday about nine hours after it broke out.READ:Macron vows to rebuild Notre-Dame after devastating fire News outlets began live-streaming broadcasts of the fire on YouTube, but below some of the clips an unusual text box popped up -- an entry from the Encyclopedia Britannica about the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.In those attacks, Al-Qaeda militants hijacked two passenger planes and flew them into the towers of the World Trade Center in New York, causing them to collapse, while a third hijacked jet smashed into the Pentagon. Some 3,000 people were killed.Smoke and flames rise during a fire at the landmark Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris on April 15, 2019, potentially involving renovation works being carried out at the site, the fire service said.A spokesman for YouTube, which is owned by Google, said the text box feature had been disabled for live streams related to the fire.""These panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call,"" the spokesman told AFP.

9,Development of Kingfisher awaits pipeline decision - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Energy, Mr Robert Kasande, yesterday said the announcement of Final Investment Decision (FID) for the Kingfisher and Tilenga oil fields is dependent on the FID of the proposed East African Crude Oil Export Pipeline.FID is an agreement on capital investments on a long term project, that is when money for the project is availed and execution starts. FID is expected to pave way for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) phase and subsequently commencement of commercial of oil production. We would not want to develop an oil field without the attendant facilities which means it will lie there idle. So we have synchronised the Kingfisher FID to that of the pipeline and Tilenga so that we move at once,  Mr Kasande told journalists at the ministry offices in Kampala.Kingfisher is operated by China s Cnooc while Tilenga is under French Total E&P.Energy minister Irene Muloni said government and Cnooc were looking at announcing FID for Kingfisher before the end of this month.Government and oil companies are currently targeting early October to announce FID for development of Kingfisher, Tilenga and the oil pipeline but regardless of when it is eventually taken, Uganda s first commercial oil is three years from FID, that is 2023.Each time the FID date slips, so does the production start date.Cnooc operates Exploration Area 3 (Kingfisher) in south of Lake Albert, and the southern fields Waraga, Mputa and Nzizi of Exploration Area 2, initially operated by Anglo-Irish Tullow before it sold them off.Mr Kasande also said technical Front End Engineering Designs, environmental studies for Tilenga oil fields at the northern end of Lake Albert in Nwoya and Buliisa districts, was approved last month, adding that  integration of comments  and review of the company s Environment Impact Assessment report is ongoing.Acquisition of 700 acres of land in Buliisa for Tilenga s attendant facilities faced hindrances after six project affected persons rejected the Shs3m compensation offered per acre and have insisted on being paid Shs21m.Development of the Tilenga oil fields is estimated to cost about Shs14 trillion ($4b).Discussions on development of the Shs13 trillion pipeline by Uganda, the three oil companies Total E&P, Tullow and Cnooc, and Tanzania are ongoing.In a related development, Mr Kasande said ongoing surveys for hydrocarbons (oil and gas) around the country have returned positive results in the Kadam-Moroto basin in northeastern Uganda, adding that they hope to licence the area. CapacityThe current stock tank of oil in place from the roughly 40 per cent area of the Albertine Graben in South Western Uganda explored so far, is 6.5 billion, with 1.7 billion recoverable, and about 500 billion cubic feet of gas resources.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Development-of-Kingfisher-awaits-pipeline-decision/688334-5073336-5v6v0b/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post9.png
10,"Notre-Dame fire under control, Macron vows to rebuild - Daily Monitor","A raging fire that tore through Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris was under control early Tuesday after the blaze brought its towering spire and roof crashing to the ground, wiping out centuries of priceless heritage central to French culture and history. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild the cathedral described as the soul of the nation and expressed relief that ""the worst had been avoided"" in a blaze that had at one point threatened the entire edifice.Thousands of Parisians and tourists watched in horror from nearby streets cordoned off by the police as flames engulfed the building and officials tried to save as much as they could of the cathedral's countless treasures, built up over centuries. The inferno destroyed the roof of the 850-year-old UNESCO world heritage landmark, whose spectacular Gothic spire collapsed as orange flames and clouds of grey smoke billowed into the early evening sky.Around 400 firefighters battled into the night to control the flames, declaring in the early hours of Tuesday that it was partially extinguished but completely under control, around nine hours after it broke out.Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet said ""we can consider that the main structure of Notre-Dame has been saved and preserved"" as well as the two bell towers.Flames and smoke are seen billowing from the roof at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15, 2019.But ""the whole of the roof has been devastated... a part of the vault has collapsed, the spire is no more"", fire brigade spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gabriel Plus said.Laurent Nunez, state secretary at the interior ministry, told reporters early Tuesday that with the immediate ""danger of the fire over,"" the focus would be on assessing the damage to the building's structure.Nunez said officials would meet shortly to see if the building was stable enough to allow fire services to go inside. 'France is Notre Dame' ""Notre-Dame survived all the wars, all the bombardments. We never thought it could burn. I feel incredibly sad and empty,"" Stephane Seigneurie, a consultant who joined other shocked onlookers in a solemn rendition of ""Ave Maria"" as they watched the fire from a nearby bridge.Gasps and cries of ""Oh my god"" erupted around an hour after the fire first broke out when the top portion of the church's spire came crashing down.""We have been dealt a knockout blow,"" a stricken-looking Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit told reporters.This file photo taken on April 01, 1945 shows a police officer controlling the traffic on the Ile de la Cit  near the H tel Dieu hospital and Notre-Dame cathedral, in April 1945 in Paris.The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear, but the cathedral had been undergoing intense restoration work which the fire service said could be linked to the blaze.French prosecutors said it was being currently being treated as an accident.Historians expressed dismay at the collapse of a building that has been a symbol of France for almost a millennium.""If Paris is the Eiffel Tower then France is Notre Dame. It's the entire culture, entire history of France incarnated in this monument,"" Bernard Lecomte, a writer and specialist in religious history told BFM TV.Deputy Paris mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told the channel that workers were scrambling ""to save all the artworks that can be saved.""Officials later said teams had managed to salvage an unknown quantity of the cultural treasures.- 'Emotion of a nation' -Macron cancelled a planned national policy speech on recent ""Yellow Vest"" protests and instead headed to the scene, where he vowed the cathedral would be reborn.""We will rebuild Notre-Dame because it is what the French expect,"" he said, describing Notre Dame as ""the epicentre of our life"" and the cathedral of ""all the French"", whether religious or not. France's billionaire Pinault dynasty immediately pledged 100 million euros for the reconstruction effort.German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Notre-Dame cathedral a ""symbol of European culture"" as the blaze raged.The Vatican on Monday expressed its ""incredulity"" and ""sadness"" over the fire. 'Water bombers not used' One firefighter was injured in the blaze, the fire brigade said, revising an earlier assessment that the individual was in a serious condition.US President Donald Trump in a tweet said it was ""horrible"" to watch the fire but caused controversy by offering advice on how to put it out.""Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!"" he said.But France's civil security service, which oversees crisis management in the country, tweeted back at Trump that the use of water-bombing aircraft was not being considered.""If used, (this) could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral,"" it said. 'Will never be the same' The cathedral is located at the very centre of the French capital and its construction was completed in the mid-12th century after some 200 years of work.During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the cathedral was vandalised in widespread anti-clerical violence: its spire was dismantled, its treasures plundered and its large statues at the grand entrance doors destroyed.It would go on to feature as a central character in a Victor Hugo novel published in 1831, ""The Hunchback of Notre-Dame"" and shortly afterwards a restoration project lasting two decades got under way, led by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.The building survived the devastation of two global conflicts in the 20th century and famously rang its bells on August 24, 1944, the day of the Liberation of Paris from German occupation at the end of the World War II.""Paris is disfigured. The city will never be like it was before,"" said Philippe, a communications worker in his mid-30s.Jacky Lafortune, a 72-year-old artist and self-described atheist stood forlornly on the banks of the River Seine staring at the burning cathedral.Comparing the mood in the French capital to the aftermath of a terror attack he said: ""But this stirs much deeper emotions because Notre-Dame is linked to the very foundations of our culture.""International sorrow as fire ravages Notre-Dame in ParisInternational leaders voiced their sorrow and solidarity with the French people as fire ravaged the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on Monday.Here are some reactions delivered through statements and tweets. European Union Notre Dame ""belongs to the whole of humanity. It has inspired writers, painters, philosophers and visitors who have come from all round the world.""- EU Commission head Jean Claude Juncker""Notre Dame of Paris is Notre-Dame of the whole of Europe.

11,Professional course will add you clout - Daily Monitor,"A year after Ramarah Nakungu graduated with a Bachelors of Commerce, she had not found a job. She figured that despite her degree being an honours, she needed to get more qualifications to add weight to it. She thus enrolled at Uganda Management Institute (UMI) for Chartered Public Accountants (CPA). Now an auditor with EFC bank, she does not regret taking on the course. Although there are not many professional courses in Uganda, there is a chance for graduates to pursue any of the available ones as the membership will not only market you in Uganda but also globally. Vincent Owori, a lecturer in CPA and CIPS at Venus Business and Communication, says academic qualifications only help one to learn the theory part of the course as there is more to any course practically.  A course such as Certified Public Account (CPA) will make you stand out of the crowd of the many accountants. Students who undergo professional courses are looked at as problem solvers with better knowledge of handling their jobs,  says Owori. Is there a right time Abdullah Mayanja, the head of professional courses department at Uganda Management Institute (UMI), says the best time would be after a degree. Through the degree background, he says, the graduate has already come across some terms that will make concepts at the professional course easy to grasp.  However, one can enroll for a professional course after O-Level such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA),  Mayanja says. The hiring questionJoweria Nansereko, a human resource and administration manager at Graben 4pl Company in Bugolobi, Kampala, says companies hire professionals because they have edge above plain graduates.  A procurement manager with CIPS is equipped with more knowledge and practicability than one with only a degree,  she says. Why the fuss   Employers and company clients feel more secure and safer with someone they feel is equipped with all competencies necessary for the job,  Nakungu, a CPA, says. Because most professional courses are international, one who pursues it can work abroad if they have to or want to.  ACCA, a UK course, is recognised in more than 170 countries in the world,  says Mayanja.Some courses offered in Uganda  Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Association of Business Executives (ABE) Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM)[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Professional-course-will-add-you-clout/688336-5071398-i6krc9z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post11.png
12,Seeing students excel is my joy - Daily Monitor,"To Samuel Businde Saalongo, 38, nothing gives him more satisfaction than meeting technicians doing good work from institutions he has served in. Born to Edward Saalongo and Joyce Kalema, Businde is the principal, Lady Aidah Computer Based Institute of Fashion Design and Technology in Wakiso, and also patron Uganda Association of Private Vocational Institutions (UGAPRIVI) Kampala District chapter. He is also a duly registered technical instructor. Businde studied at Kezekiya Memorial Primary School in Rakai from 1987 to 93, then joined Kibaale Community Secondary School for O-Level and completed in 1999 with Aggregate 28. In 2000, I joined Kammengo Technical Institute with a goal to be a water engineer. I studied plumbing. This was a course least known to us by then but I was attracted to it because the sector was fast developing in Uganda,  Businde says. After he completed his Advanced level (Craft part Il) in 2003, and because he was an active student, the principal of the school then, (Charles Ebong) offered him an opportunity to start teaching. I eagerly accepted and he sent me to Kabira Technical Institute-Bushenyi in August 2003.  Young as I was, I went out ready to teach plumbing before our exams were even released,  he recalls.Since then, Businde never looked back but instead appreciated it more.  Teaching was very flexible. I even had time to get simple contracts of installing water in some buildings within Kabira and Ishaka Town as I trained students at the institute,  he says.Decision timeIn 2005, he decided to go back to school but this time to train as a teacher. He enrolled for an in-service Technical Teachers Education programme at Kal Institute of Technical Teacher Education (KaLIOTTE) where he got a certificate that made him register as a qualified teacher.In 2008, he joined the Royal Institute of Technical Teacher Education to head the department of plumbing and later on, was appointed deputy principal to coordinate academics and skills training at the institute. In 2009, Businde joined Kampala Polytechnic, Mengo to upgrade with a Diploma in Water Engineering for two years and in 2015 asked to serve as a visiting principal at Uganda Children s Centre Vocational and Technical Institute on Salaama Road.Through the ranksBusinde notes that growing through the ranks in vocational education requires thorough knowledge about the dynamics in the sector but he says he was able to do this because he had committed mentors who helped him actualise the leadership roles and as well as teaching.  Simon Kisasa, the former Uganda National Examinations Board deputy executive secretary and Emmanuel Bampiigga, the former national chairman UGAPRIVI, are the people who have continuously modelled me,  he confesses. Motivation  In leading and training, I aim at seeing people who go through my hands able to apply the skills acquired but also able to upgrade their studies. My core task is to make them get more informed so as to equally compete with the challenges in the world of work,  says Businde.Though one of the most evident challenges of vocational education in the country is the negative attitude by both parents and students especially due to lack of sensitisation, Businde is proud that more people, even professors have started to understand the impact of vocational education at all levels.It is also against this backdrop that he established a voluntary organisation; Change Education Attitude, Uganda, that goes around the country sensitising Ugandans, parents in particular, to embrace and harness vocational education. We make them appreciate that vocational education is purposeful because it introduces the students directly to the world of work and opens doors for advancing,  says Businde. Challenges Being a leader in a private vocational institute, he says, they encounter several challenges including, low enrollment of students, heavy taxes in procuring training materials, equipment and tools; and low fees charged by schools which makes running of these institutions difficult.  This results into poor remuneration which affects skills training and might lead to passing out incompetent personnel. Additionally, the public has not yet accepted that one can progressively go through technical education right from community polytechnic up to PhD,  he notes. Furthermore, Businde believes it is everyone s role to support Business Technical Vocational Education and Training (BTVET) by sensitising the public to realise the potential value in it.  I implore all of us to appreciate that the only way to fight unemployment and poverty out of Uganda is in BTVET,  Businde implores. Brief bio1987-1993.

13,MPs kick out URA team over Akol s absence - Daily Monitor,"Officials from the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) were Tuesday afternoon kicked out of an accountability committee of Parliament after they turned up without the Commissioner General, Doris Akol.The House Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises chaired by Kawempe South MP Mubarak Munyagwa, was scheduled to receive written responses to Auditor General s queries for the Financial Year 2013/2014.Ms Akol is the accounting officer for URA and the law mandates her to respond to the anomalies highlighted in the Auditor General s report.The 2014 report raises a number of red flags ranging from under declaration of taxes, uncollected debt and mismanagement of goods impounded by URA officials.READ:URA officials quizzed over missing fuelHowever, when they turned up, the URA delegation led by Henry Saka, the Commissioner domestic taxes, informed the Committee that Akol had travelled to South Africa on a two weeks trip. Mr Munyagwa told the URA team that, only the accounting officer, should give answers [and] we have nothing to proceed with, unless Akol shows up. The committee chairperson and members then ordered the team to leave the committee. We are dealing with issues involving colossal sums of money, we just can t afford to sit and have a casual conversation,  Mr Munyagwa explained.The lawmaker insisted that he has been falsely accused of being harsh and that he wants to accord a fair hearing to URA.This was a continuation of last week s meeting in which URA officials failed to explain circumstances under which 9,733 litres of impounded fuel disappeared in their custody.The officials led by the Commissioner General, Ms Doris Akol, were appearing before Cosase.According to the Auditor General s report, URA seized 110,481 litres of petrol on May 30, 2006. The report adds that due taxes and penalties worth Shs93.9m were assessed and paid by the tax payer. But on the day of collecting the fuel, it was established that it was less.Consequently, a sum of Shs63.3m was agreed and paid to the owner as compensation. The point of concern was that whereas taxes were collected at a rate of Shs850 per litre, compensation was at a higher rate of Shs6,508.72 per litre.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/MPs-kick-out-URA-team-over-Akol-s-absence-/688334-5074068-12yjksi/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post13.png
14,Notre-Dame counts cost as daylight reveals damage - Daily Monitor,"Shards of stained glass from priceless medieval windows, and a gaping hole above the choir area where the spire crashed down: daylight reveals the extent of damage at Notre-Dame cathedral on Tuesday morning as firefighters put out the last smouldering remains of the fire.Philippe Marsset, the vicar general of Notre-Dame, was among the first to enter the storied Gothic cathedral whose sculpted arches have been blackened by smoke and pews destroyed.""It felt like I was looking at a bombing,"" Marsset said of the church where he was ordained a priest 31 years ago.""It was hell,"" he said, describing the moment when the blaze was discovered on the soaring roof shortly after evening mass ended shortly before 7:00 pm (1700 GMT) on Monday.Church officials raced to remove as many artefacts, paintings and other cultural treasures they could before being evacuated by firefighters as they tried to stop the flames from spreading.Flames and smoke are seen billowing from the roof at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15, 2019.But the blaze kept springing up as globs of molten lead fell from the soaring heights of the church.""All night long I saw men going past with tears in their eyes. I described it this way: It was total chaos, but we can't let it knock us down,"" Marsset said.""This church was built 850 years ago. It withstood the wars, it withstood the bombings, it resisted everything,"" he said. Yet not all was lost: the crucifix standing over the main altar was one of several objects which escaped destruction.""I'm devastated, even if I haven't been a Catholic for a long time,"" 88-year-old Claire told AFP at the scene on Tuesday morning. ""I was baptised here.""On the banks of the river Seine, hundreds of Parisians and tourists stopped by on Tuesday morning to take pictures or gaze at the disaster site, many still stunned by the damage. 'Heroic' ""This isn't some little church that was damaged -- it's the symbol of the history of France and of Paris,"" Marsset said, noting that all distances from Paris are calculated from the square in front of Notre-Dame.But in the end there was relief that much was able to be saved, with much of stonework as well as the two massive square bell towers largely unscathed.US soldiers walk and take pictures on the Pont de l'Archev ch  near Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on October 01, 1944Most of the emblematic rose windows of medieval stained glass were also spared, including the huge round window dominating the church's intricately carved western facade.""We're all just dumbfounded. It's more than miraculous, it's heroic,"" Marsset said, calling the firefighters who toiled throughout the night ""heroes.""But he appeared lost for words when asked about what would happen now, as Christians worldwide prepared to celebrate Easter next Sunday.""We had things planned for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday -- We don't yet know where to do these. It's as if our mother has been wounded,"" he said.""My bed was right there,"" he adds, pointing towards the cathedral, where smoke continued to rise into the sky Tuesday morning.""It's not the Notre-Dame (Our Lady) of Catholics.

16,Egypt parliament votes on extending Sisi rule - Daily Monitor,"Egypt's parliament, packed with loyalists of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is to vote Tuesday on changes to the constitution that could keep the former military chief in power until 2030.The proposed amendments were initially introduced in February by a parliamentary bloc supportive of Sisi and updated this week after several rounds of parliamentary debates.It includes changing Article 140 of the constitution to allow the Egyptian president to extend his current four-year term, which ends in 2022, by two years.A further change would permit Sisi to stand for another six-year term and potentially remain president until 2030.Sisi led the army's overthrow of elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 following mass protests against the Islamist leader's rule.He won his first term as president in 2014 and was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote, after standing virtually unopposed.His government has been widely criticised by human rights groups for the repression of political opponents.But Mohamed Abu-Hamed, one of the members of parliament who pushed for constitutional amendments to keep Sisi in power, is adamant that the changes are a must.""The constitution in 2014 was written under tough exceptional circumstances,"" he told AFP.He hailed Sisi as a president who ""took important political, economic and security measures... (and) must continue with his reforms,"" in the face of the unrest gripping neighbouring countries following the toppling of veteran president Omar al-Bashir in Sudan and the escalation of the conflict in Libya.Keeping Sisi in power, he added, reflects ""the will of the people"". 'Authoritarian rule' Since Sisi overthrew Morsi, Egypt has drawn heavy international criticism for its sweeping crackdown on dissent. The authorities have jailed thousands of Morsi's supporters as well as liberal and secular activists, including a popular blogger, actors, singers and journalists. Last week, Human Rights Watch warned that the amendments, which would also increase the military's political role and grant Sisi control over the judiciary, would ""institutionalise authoritarianism"".As Sisi visited Washington for talks with President Donald Trump, it urged Congress, to withhold endorsement of the Egyptian president's bid to extend his rule.""Congress needs to use its levers to pressure the Egyptian president to reverse course, starting with withdrawing these constitutional amendments set to consolidate authoritarian rule,"" said HRW's Michael Page.As well as a crackdown on dissent, Sisi has overseen a military campaign against Islamic State group-linked militants based in the Sinai PeninsulaOn Tuesday, the 596-seat parliament will also vote on a controversial article which critics fear might allow the military a greater influence in Egyptian political life.The vote is expected to be swift after the bill passed by an overwhelming majority earlier this year.If the bill is passed by a majority of two thirds, parliament will then hold a referendum in which Egyptians will vote on the raft of amendments.Other proposed amendments include a quota for women's representation of no less than 25 percent in parliament and forming a second parliamentary chamber.Human rights groups and opposition parties say the government has intensified its crackdown on dissent with a wave of arrests ahead of the vote.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Egypt-parliament-votes-extending-Sisi-rule/688340-5073706-vmgxd7z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post16.png
17,Cleric condemns arbitrary arrests - Daily Monitor,"KANUNGU/KASESE- The head of Kihihi Archdeaconry, the Rev Can Justus Tibesigwa, has criticised security agencies for the arbitrary arrests in the ongoing hunt for criminals who abducted a US tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott and Ugandan guide Jean Paul Mirenge.The two were kidnapped from Queen Elizabeth National Park Ishasha Sector on April 2 by four armed men and released on April 7 after paying a ransom of $30,000 (about (Shs110 million). The money was allegedly taken to the neigbouring DR Congo where they were being held.Locals say about 30 people have since been arrested from Kanungu District, mainly in Kihihi Town Council, which has created fear in the community. Addressing the congregation during the Palm Sunday prayers, Rev Tibesigwa, who is also the former Kinkizi Diocesan Secretary, said even those who merely speak about the abduction are picked up. Some people are being arrested in bad faith, we need prayers on how police and security agencies are conducting the operation. Some people have been arrested because they have been  negligent  in their ways,  Rev Tibesigwa said.He urged locals to be smart and careful in what they do to avoid trouble in the ongoing investigations. The Deputy Resident District Commissioner, Mr Emmy Ngabirano, on Monday said out of 21 people being held at police, 10 have been freed and 11 retained. The District Police Commander, Mr Julius Turyagumanawe, declined to comment on the matter and referred our reporter to the police spokesperson for Kigezi Region Elly Maate, who also referred the matter to the police headquarters. Police spokesperson Fred Enanga did not answer our repeated calls. US President Donald Trump has urged Ugandan government to arrest and prosecute the kidnappers.Meanwhile, Uganda Wild Life Authority (UWA) last week tightened security at the national park.Two new ranger posts have so far been opened in the middle of the park and more forces deployed to ensure security.  We (government), have decided to establish many ranger posts all over the park in order to seal off all security gaps. The isolated incident of kidnap last week awakened our security checks,  the State minister for Tourism, Mr Godfrey Kiwanda, said while launching the ranger posts on Friday at Queen Elizabeth National Park. They launched the Lions Bay and Katore ranger posts. Installing camerasMinister Kiwanda noted that government through UWA is planning to use technology to increase park surveillance by installing CCTV cameras for quick response to security challenges in the park. He also announced a discount on all Easter offer charges as one way of giving back to the local visitors. The deputy Japanese ambassador to Uganda, Mr Mizimoto Horri, who founded the construction of Lions Bay ranger post, challenged UWA officials to utilise the facility to achieve the intended purpose. The UWA executive director, Mr Sam Mwandah, noted that efforts to secure Queen Elizabeth National Park were being limited by the 11 fishing villages inside the area and the three main highways that run through it.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Cleric-condemns-arbitrary-DR-Congo-Kanungu-Palm-Sunday/688334-5073140-mxk0pgz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post17.png
18,Farmers express mixed views on Museveni s rejection of Sugar Bill - Daily Monitor,"Jinja- President Museveni s recent refusal to assent to the Sugar Bill has drawn mixed reactions from sugarcane farmers and manufacturers in Busoga Sub-region.Addressing the NRM Parliamentary Caucus retreat at the National Leadership Institute in Kyankwanzi District last month, Mr Museveni said he refused to sign the Sugar Bill into law in order to protect the sugar industry. The way you are behaving, you are antagonising our old sugar people and I don t know the relationship you have with small sugar people,  the President said.But speaking at the weekend, the spokesperson of Busoga Sugarcane Out growers Association (BSGA), Mr Godfrey Naitema, expressed displeasure with the President s decision, arguing that Uganda is a liberalised economy where all investors are free to compete. Mr Museveni wants to favour only big investors yet he previously said he wants Uganda to be an industrialised country. We shall not accept monopoly in the country because we are already a liberalised economy,  he said.Mr Naitema said the current factories in Busoga, including Old Kakira Sugar Works Limited, cannot consume all the available sugarcane due to low demand from millers. President Museveni s refusal to assent to the Bill means farmers from Busoga will be the most affected because sugarcane farming is their main source of income. We have educated our children up to university using proceeds from sugarcane; so, limiting the number of sugar companies in an area will reduce on the market for our sugarcanes,  he said.According to Mr Naitema, if Parliament reinstates Clause 22 of the Sugar Bill [zoning], it will give old sugar companies a chance to reduce on the sugarcane prices because competition for raw materials will be eliminated.Key amendments in the Bill include deleting Clause 22, which had provided that the Sugar Board would not license more than one miller in an area within a radius of 25 kilometres from another.It also includes a new formula for paying sugarcane out growers, notably that the minimum prices will be a product of the weight in tonnes of the cane and the amount of sugar to be squeezed out of every 100 tonnes times 50 per cent.The 50 per cent is to compensate the out growers for the additional derivatives that millers extract from sugar such as molasses, ethanol and bagasse for power generation.The chairperson of Uganda Sugar Manufacturers Association (USMA), Mr Jim Kabeho, said the absence of a zoning policy compels millers to fight for sugarcane, which has killed the sugar industry. Since 2005 when these small factories started mushrooming, production has been going down yet ordinarily, it would have been going up because of the many factories,  Mr Kabeho said.  Uganda had a capacity of producing 600,000 metric tonnes of sugar every year but we are now producing only 400,000 tonnes because there are no enough raw materials for all the existing plants,  he said.The manager in-charge of large taxpayers at URA, Mr Simon Ngabirano, while in Kakira last week, said MPs rushed to pass the Sugar bill without understanding its implication.He said this has led to the Bill s misinterpretation. We can see the level of interests about the sugar Bill I think President s actions at the moment gives us chance to have another look, there is an opportunity to give the MPs time to re-table it because scarcity of materials and competition is not healthy in the Sugar sector,  Mr Ngabirano said. He was speaking during a function to recognise Kakira Sugar Works Ltd for its Shs254b contribution in taxes.About sugarcane sectorFarmers- BSGA records indicate that Busoga sub-region has 20,000 large scale sugarcane farmers and five sugar factories of Kakira Sugar Works in Jinja, Mayuge Sugar Factory, GM Sugar Factory in Njeru Town Council, Buikwe District, Kamuli Sugar Limited and Kaliro Sugar Limited.Likelihood. If Parliament amends the Bill, sources say all small sugar mills near established sugar factories will be compensated and given a five-year tax holiday until they break even. On March 1, Mr Museveni wrote to the Speaker of Parliament, Ms Rebecca Kadaga, rejecting the Bill.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Farmers-Museveni-Sugar-Bill-Busoga-NRM-Kakira/688334-5073146-15ft8yfz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post18.png

Staff started removing furniture from the buildings last Thursday following a reminder from Namulondo Investments Limited, an investment arm of the kingdom.In a March 22 letter addressed to the district, the kingdom accused the leaders of deliberately failing to formalise their tenancy. You stated that some officials promised to give a response to your claim of being bonafide/lawful occupants on the kingdom s land, but they did not revert to you. Our client does not have any record of any meeting with your office where such issues were discussed and resolved neither did you furnish us with the same,  Mr Magellan Kazibwe, a lawyer of Namulondo Investments Ltd, states in the letter.He said they will seek legal redress if district authorities fail to organise a meeting with kingdom officials in two weeks. The office blocks have been housing the office of the chief administration officer, health and education departments.Mr Jude Mbabaali, the district chairperson, said he relocated the affected departments to Kijjabwemi Rehabilitation Centre premises, about 2km away.  In the meantime, let us minimise the pressure put on us by Buganda, it is better we vacate as we find a solution of paying their money,  he said.Mr Mbabaali said they have written to central government requesting for funds to build their own headquarters, adding that they are yet to receive a response.Eviction noticeMr Musa Matovu Kigongo, the Buddu County spokesperson, said they have launched a campaign to evict districts in Buganda that are not paying the nominal ground rent. Months ago, authorities in Kalungu District were also given a 30-day ultimatum to vacate the kingdom buildings after failing to pay the rent amounting to Shs281.2m. However, the kingdom later rescinded its earlier decision after district officials promised to clear the arrears soon.

21,Locals adopt tree planting to fight disasters - Daily Monitor,"MANAFWA. A move by a group of residents to conserve the slopes of Mt Elgon in Bugisu Sub-region has started paying off after several years of grappling with disastrous landslides and floods. The residents under their umbrella association Bubulo Environmental Conservation and Management Association  (BECOMAP) have for the past three years been engaging in conservation activities to restore the degraded ecosystem in the landslide prone districts of Manafwa and neighbouring Namisindwa by planting trees on the hills that have been left bare due to massive deforestation. They have also planted bamboo trees and elephant grass on the banks of River Manafwa. Mr Musa Mandu, the chairperson of the association, said:  We realised nothing will work best to prevent such disasters in this region better than embracing conservation through community- based approaches. He said they are also operating nursery beds and practising fish farming and bee keeping as source of their income. Mr Mandu said they have also trained locals in several sub-counties in districts of Manafwa and Namisindwa to engage in good farming practices such as contour ploughing and digging terraces on hilly areas.He said this has improved livehoods, boosted catchment and reduced soil erosion, adding that they have plans to extend their project to Bududa by end of this year.  Mr Mandu said in the past, whenever it rained, River Manafwa would cause havoc and wash away their crops, livestock, bridges and houses.  We decided to plant different types of trees with strong roots along the river to curb flooding, which had become a menace in this area,  he said. Ms Susan Nakhayali, a member of the association, said previously, in Namutebi, the land was bare especially on the steep slopes but now it is being restored. The association, which has more than 150 members, was formed to promote environment conservation as solution to disasters. It has its headquarters in Namutebi Town Council in Manafwa District.The Mt Elgon area has registered spates of deadly landslides last year only between May and October more than 67 landslides were recorded.Mr Micheal Milisho, a member, said although they are doing voluntary work, they are happy that they are helping to save humanity from disasters.  We are working closely with district leadership to promote the conservation to mitigate the disasters and prevent the loss of lives of our people. That is our hope, which keeps us moving,  he says, adding that government and non-government organisations should supply them with more tree seedlings. In Bubuyela Village in Buyinza Town Council, residents have adopted the method of making terraces using rocks to control speed. The State minister for Environment, Ms Mary Gorreti Kitutu, said:  This is a true spirit of trying to address ecosystem degradation, which is a major drive of disasters such as landsides in Bugisu region.  The permanent secretary in the Ministry of Water and Environment, Mr Alfred Okidi Okot, said during the retreat for senior management of his ministry in Mbale Town at the weekend, that the government is willing and committed to supporting residents who have embraced environmental smart solutions to fight climate change. The deputy head of civil service, Ms Deborah Katuramu, said it is good that residents have started owning up responsibilities but urged the civil servants to play their part in service delivery. LandslidesLast year only between May and October more than 67 landslides were recorded at Mt Elgon area.However, in most of the landslides, there was no human deaths recorded apart from the Bukalasi mudslide in Bududa District, which left more than 50 people dead after River Tsume burst its banks due to heavy rain.In March 2010, more than 150 people were killed and 10,000 displaced in Nametsi, Bududa District by landslides.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Locals-adopt-tree-planting-fight-disasters/688334-5071498-lo8wvd/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post21.png
22,Gulu university returning officer detained - Daily Monitor,"Police are holding Gulu University returning officer Edmond Okello over allegations of interfering with the guild presidential elections.Okello was picked on Saturday evening shortly after announcing Mr Johnson Nowe as the winner of the hotly contested guild elections held on Saturday.Mr Nowe, a third year student of Medicine and Surgery garnered 1,403 votes, according to the results read by Mr Okello.Nowe defeated his close rival Samuel Oyet Agwani, a second year student pursuing Bachelor of Arts in Education who got 750 votes. He will now replace outgoing guild president Daniel Mbazira.Other candidatesImuran Ntambazi Java, who identified himself with People Power movement got 398 votes, Mr Alexander Okidi, a second year student pursuing Bachelor of Development Studies, garnered 158 votes while Moses Etyak, a second year student of Bachelor of Computer Science who came last with only 79 votes.However after the results were announced, some of the contestants and their supporters accused Mr Okello of helping Nowe to rig elections.They also complained that the number of ballot papers printed were less than the required numbers which made many students to miss voting.Mr Okello was later whisked away by police after the students tried to beat him up.The Aswa River Region Police Spokesperson Jimmy Patrick Okema told Daily Monitor that Okello is detained at Gulu central police station to prevent students from attacking him.""We carried out a preventive arrest because he was under threat from angry students. We shall free him when the situation is calm,"" Mr Okema said.The Spokesperson Gulu University electoral commission, Mr Emmanuel Ochan admitted that the ballot papers printed were less and blamed Okello for the mistakes.He noted that they had expected 5,000 ballot papers but only 3,000 were printed adding that by 4pm, voting had already stopped despite many students who had not yet cast their votes.A total of 4,700 students registered to vote for the guild elections.""Many students especially in the faculty of Humanity missed out because the ballot papers were over.

23,Kabaka rallies schools on holistic education - Daily Monitor,"Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II has lauded schools championing holistic education programmes, saying it gives children hope for a brighter future.While addressing subjects during his 64th birthday celebrations at Ndejje Secondary School in Luweero District at the weekend, the Kabaka said every school should strive to achieve holistic education. All schools offering holistic education and upholding standards are giving us hope of a good future for the young generation. We thank Ndejje SS and all the other schools for the great work. We thank God for giving us life and we pray that God gives us the strength to serve our country in a better way,  the Kabaka said.Besides academics, holistic education entails co-curricular activities such as sports and music.Earlier, he toured different projects at Ndejje SS where he commissioned the administration block and planted a tree in commemoration of his birthday.He also gave accolades to five people in recognition for their contribution in developing the kingdom. These included businessman Gordon Wavamunno, Mr Magid Bagalaaliwo, musician Mesach Ssemakula, Mr IK Kabanda and Mr Abdul Kaaga.Mr Charles Peter Mayiga, the Katikkiro, said the celebrations come at a time when Buganda has registered progress in many areas which he attributed to team work. Buganda is on the right track in areas of development which is not only reflected in projects, but the health of its people. Many people look worried about the future of their country where the youth believe the time is now to engage in leadership which is healthy,  he said. Mr Mayiga warned residents of Bulemezi County against relying on handouts, but establish small enterprises to fight household poverty. This mentality [of surviving on handouts] is not good. Time for lamenting about the liberation war is not now because you have the capacity to live a better life,  he said.The Katikkiro also urged parents to ensure that their school-going children wear shoes. This is for the health of our children because many children still walk bare footed as they move to school. This should not happen in Buganda,  Mr Mayiga said.Bishop Elidard Nsubuga of Luweero Diocese urged parents and communities not to abandon the responsibility of grooming children into future responsible citizens. The good morals cannot be instilled by teachers at the day care centres. This should be a collective responsibility. We have parents who do not want to contribute to children s welfare, including their lunch. This is very bad and should stop because only healthy children will have the opportunity to concentrate,  he said.BACKGROUNDThe birthday celebrations began with Kabaka Birthday Run in Kampala and other towns and diaspora on April 7. Kabaka Mutebi was born on April 13, 1955, to Kabaka Edward Fredrick Muteesa II and Nabakyala Sarah Nalule at Mulago hospital and spent his early years in Mengo palace. He was later taken to the UK in 1967 when President Milton Obote abolished kingdoms.

24,"Mob lynches man for killing wife, son - Daily Monitor","KAKUMIRO. Grief and shock on Friday gripped residents of Kyakachwende Village, Katatemwa Parish in Kakindo Sub-county, Kakumiro District, after a 25-year-old man allegedly killed his wife and his one-year-old step son.Joseph Kukundakwe, a causal labourer, allegedly slit the throats of Rosett Tumuhirwe, 37, and Brian Ampumpaire with a machete and closed them inside the house. The duo had been married for 45 days.The District Police Commander, Mr Najib Waiswa, said the suspect, after committing the crime, went into hiding but residents mounted a search, found him and beat him up before police intervened.He was taken to Kakindo Health Centre IV where he was pronounced dead shortly after.Adrine Kirabo, 14, a daughter of Tumuhirwe, said she went to check on her mother on Saturday only to be repelled by a foul smell at the door of the house.On entering, she found the mutilated bodies of her mother and brother. I immediately called my grandmother who made an alarm that attracted residents,  Kirabo narrated.Police appealPolice conducted a postmortem before handing over the bodies of the deceased to relatives for burial. Mr Waiswa condemned the act and urged residents to always use local leaders in resolving domestic misunderstandings. People should not use violence to solve conflicts. People can use their neighbours, local leaders or even go to church rather than killing somebody,  he said.The sub-county chairperson, Mr Micheal Yombo, who had employed the two, said the man wrote a will before attempting to commit suicide. The man, after killing his wife and child, attempted to take poison. He also wrote his will, detailing why he had killed his step son and wife,  Mr Yombo said. The village chairperson, Mr Emmanuel Serunjogi, revealed that he had on several occasions received complaints of misunderstandings from the couple.Recent incident Rising cases. Five children of a businessman at Kahompo Village, Bufunjo Sub-county in Kyenjojo District were on March 13 hacked to death by unidentified assailants. The deceased were all children of Joseph Tumwebaze, a businessman and resident of Kahompo village. Police say the assailants hacked all the children to death, beat up the wife before they carried and dumped her in River Kahompo from where she was later rescued by the residents. According to detectives, Tumwebaze had travelled to Kasese District at the time his home was attacked. Police later arrested five people in connection with the murder. Investigations later pointed to a family wrangle that dates back in 2012.

25,Nodding syndrome parasite discovered - Daily Monitor,"A lead researcher into the mysterious Nodding Syndrome at the Ministry of Health has defined Onchocerca Volvulus (OV) as a parasite responsible for the cause of nodding in children where several lives in Acholi Sub-region have been lost.The nodding syndrome is a mysterious illness that affects the brain and central nervous system of children, primarily between the ages of five and 15.The children nod off their heads coupled with seizures and in most cases they lose the contact of the surrounding environment.The disease causes increased diminishment in mental capacity and over the course of time, many children develop severe growth retardation. A child who is 12 or 13 will appear to be six or eight years old.While presenting his research report before stakeholders in Gulu Town on Friday, Dr Richard Idro said his team was able to identify OV, a parasite vectored by black fly as the responsible parasite behind the nodding syndrome.The research that kicked off in 2015 in the northern region where nodding syndrome is reported relied on data provided by global positioning systems to come to a conclusion. We found that the nodding syndrome is associated with Onchocerciasis, which is transmitted by Onchocerca Volvulus found in black flies. This was after we tagged and mapped all the victims  GPS coordinates which indicated victims  concentration (population) on River Aswa which is an infection of the black fly,  Dr Idro said.The research, which was conducted in laboratories across the six districts of Lamwo, Kitgum, Pader, Lira, Omoro and Gulu, discovered fragments of proteins of OV peptides in the cerebrospinal fluids drawn from the victims.In his report, Dr Idro stated that more than 95 per cent of the specimen (participants) with nodding syndrome examined preliminarily showed higher levels of OV antibodies than in epileptic cases.He stated that their conclusion on black fly factor, a vector of Onchocerca Volvulus Microfilaria, discovered as being the cause of the infection was derived from results of larviciding and aerial spraying done in communities around River Aswa. Following mapping, larviciding and spraying by government to eradicate black fly in 2013, Uganda has not had any new case of nodding disease, this means that the black fly itself has been a big factor in the infection although the mechanism is yet to be established,  he said.The proportion of nodding syndrome patients testing positive for OV has since dropped from 15 in 2013 to four in 2017, when government embarked on massive vector control of black flies, the report stated.Tested samples from hair, blood, urine, soil, water and animals from this infected area did not reveal any toxins, thus nullifying the assumption that the disease could have been a result of chemical weapons due to the long war in the sub-region between Lord Resistance Army and UPDF or poisoned food distributed by humanitarian bodies during the insurgency.The report indicates that the brain damages in victims is permanent and requires medication for life.  Even if we got the drugs that cure the syndrome, the brains of the already affected children will never be healed, because the infection damaged the brain,   he said.It was also revealed that the brains of victims with severe conditions became smaller (generalised) cerebral atrophy [thinning] and degenerated like in the elderly with tau-Protein deposits [taupathy]. Last year, a team of researchers led by Dr Richard Echodu of Gulu University, in their six years  research failed to link the infection to mycotoxins in contaminated foods when they discovered no supporting evidence for the association between the two.The researchers were assessing whether the consumption of fungal mycotoxins contributes to nodding syndrome development after a WHO International meeting in Kampala in 2012 recommended that fungal contamination of foods should be investigated as a possible cause of the disease. More than 3,000 children in Acholi are grappling with the disease and more than 500 have so far died.Previous reportIn September 2018, a group of six scientists led by Ontario-based Prof Michael Pollanen and Uganda s consultant pathologist, Dr Sylvester Onzivua, released a report linking the disease to taupathy, referring to a degenerative disease linked to deposition of insoluble proteins in the brain.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Nodding-syndrome-parasite-discovered/688334-5071698-11cyrog/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post25.png
26,Government shifts Apaa Market amid protest from traders - Daily Monitor,"AMURU/ADJUMANI. Government has ordered businessmen and residents to stop operating in Apaa Market, one of the markets sitting on the disputed Apaa land bordering Amuru and Adjumani districts.The market brings together hundreds of traders from both Amuru and Adjumani who deal mainly in agricultural products. It was previously in Pabbo Sub-county, Amuru District, before government forcefully demarcated it in October 2017 and handed it to Adjumani District local government.In an April 10 letter written by the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) officer-in-charge of East Madi Wildlife Reserve, Mr Tony Olinga Bogere, traders were ordered to conduct their last business in the market on April 12 (Friday).He also noted that the market has since been shifted to Zoka Centre in Zoka Parish, Itirikwa Sub-county, about 10 kilometres inside Adjumani, arguing that the previous space is within a protected area.The move follows a directive from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) dated March 28 that directed the Ministry of Local Government and the Adjumani District local government to urgently close Apaa Market, describing it as  illegal .The latest directive by government, however, sparked outrage among locals and district officials.The Adjumani District chairperson, Mr James Leku, said the decision has long been in the interest of the district since it s in a protected area.But his counterpart in Amuru District, Mr Michael Lakony, says the directive was undertaken by the OPM and the President without consulting the team they constituted to negotiate over the land. In February this year, cabinet resolved that the locals who are victims of the Apaa land conflict be resettled with building materials and money after assessing damages.A memorandum of understanding seen by Daily Monitor indicates that the victims are to be given a package of Shs10 million, 20 iron sheets, 20 bags of cements, and Shs2 million for those who cannot identify themselves or without National IDs.The process of relocation and compensation is supposed to be spearheaded by Office of the Prime Minister, Lands Ministry and the Northern Uganda State Minister, Ms Grace Kwiyucwiny.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-shifts-Apaa-Market-amid-protest-from-traders/688334-5071706-cnvc1f/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post26.png

28,Museveni directs on stalled Luweero district office block - Daily Monitor,"Luwero. President Museveni has directed the Minister for Local Government to schedule the stalled construction of Luweero District administration block, Daily Monitor has established.In a letter dated March 25 signed by the Principal Private Secretary to the President, Ms Molly Kamukama, the minister for Local Government was directed to scrutinise a letter written by the Luweero District chairperson, Mr Ronald Ndawula, complaining about a delayed presidential pledge in constructing the district offices that had not been fulfilled for more than two decades. This is to inform you that his Excellency the President directed that you bring the matter of the Luweero District headquarters  building to Cabinet for discussion. The purpose of this letter is to therefore communicate the directive for your management,  Ms Kamukama s letter to the minister reads in part.Official records at Luweero District offices indicate the district administration block construction pledge is among the unfulfilled pledges made by the President to the people of Luweero 27 years ago. For the district headquarter block, it was not only a pledge, but a compensation which I believe Luweero deserved,  Mr Ndawula said in an interview on Tuesday.While touring government projects in Luweero District in 1991, President Museveni pledged to have Luweero District compensated through construction of a modern office block to house the district administration headquarters. The pledge was in response to concerns raised by the district leaders about the buildings that were taken over by the army.Efforts by Luweero leaders to make a follow-up on the district headquarter building pledge have never yielded fruit despite the repeated reminders.Mr Ndawula said Luweero has become a laughing stock with many Opposition politicians castigating the NRM ruling government for neglecting the area.Luweero was the epicentre of the five-year guerrilla war that ushered Mr Museveni s government to power in 1986 and the area has largely been loyal to Mr Museveni through contributing to his vote pool and electing ruling party representatives at various levels. We have no direct answers to give to our opponents when they use the unfulfilled pledges as a political capital to undermine the efforts by President Museveni to transform Uganda and the people of Luweero. We are happy that for the first time, the President is making a direct intervention to have this matter put to rest,  Mr Ndawula said.In 2008, the then district chairperson, Mr Abdul Nadduli, currently serving as Minister without Portfolio, said government through the Office of the Prime Minister had requested Luweero District to come up with a detailed plan and documentation on the presidential pledge for the office block so that government comes up with a formal plan. By the time Mr Nadduli left office in 2015, government had not yet responded.Last year, the district authorities mobilised for construction materials from well-wishers and friends of Luweero to embark on the construction of Shs4.5b office block. More than Shs200m was raised to have the foundation of the office block. However, construction works have stalled for more than 9 months with the district leaders complaining over lack of funds to continue with the project.A 2015 report by the parliamentary Committee on Government Assurances indicated that the President had not delivered on 817 pledges since coming to power in 1986.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Museveni-directs-stalled-Luweero-district-office-block/688334-5067820-m28oh7z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post28.png
29,Njeru vendors resort to buckets to answer nature s call - Daily Monitor,"Buikwe. Vendors and taxi operators at Nile Market and Nile Taxi Park in Njeru Municipality, Buikwe District, have resorted to using buckets to ease themselves due to the poor state of the lavatory facilities.They claim the existing toilet, which serves more than 1000 people is in a sorry state and any attempts to use it exposes them to diseases.Mr Shaban Kalulu, an attendant, who has worked at the toilet for more than 10 years, says the number of vendors and taxi operators using the facility has drastically reduced due to its poor state.He said the flushing system is no longer functioning and it requires a lot of water to keep the toilet clean. The toilet is also near a garbage collection point which creates a pungent smell in the area. What most people are doing now, especially vendors, is that they put a bucket inside their stalls, into which they urinate. They later mix the faecal matter with water to disguise it and then pour it out in the garbage pits every evening,  he said on Wednesday.Mr Kalulu said it was high time the municipal authorities constructed a new public toilet in the area to avoid an outbreak of diseases. We need a new toilet facility because the population of Njeru has grown over time,  Mr Kalulu said.InfectionMs Zainah Mutesi, a vendor at Nile Market, said she repeatedly suffered complications and only got a relief when she stopped using the toilet. I got some infection which persisted for many months and that is when I realised the toilet is dangerous. It is very difficult to use it without getting dirty, I request the municipality officials to at least renovate it if they cannot build a new one,  Ms Mutesi said.Mr Steven Oboi, the chairperson of Nile Market, admitted the market lacks toilets and that is why the use the only available one belonging to the taxi park. We have more than 400 registered vendors in the market, but the truth is we have no toilet,  he said.Njeru Municipality health inspector, Andrew Wandira Kaitaita said they are in the process of constructing a new public toilet that will serve all people in both the market and taxi park.  It is true the toilet is old because it was constructed when Njeru was still a town council. We request residents to remain calm because this coming financial year, we have a plan to erect a modern toilet,  he said.Njeru Municipality has public toilets at every market in three divisions of Nyenga, Wakiso and Njeru that make up the municipality. However, all of them are in a sorry state.The town was elevated to a municipality in the 2016/2017 Financial Year, but operated without a substantive leadership until July last year when new leaders were elected.Availability of clean lavatory facilities is still a challenge in many urban centres. Usually, attendants charge between Shs200 and Shs500 to use toilets. If one is to ease oneself five times a day, it would require between Shs1,000 and Shs2,500 to use a toilet each day which many town dwellers can hardly afford.Recent reportAccording to Water Aid Uganda recent findings, around 26,000 children die every year from diarrhoea which is caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation in Uganda. A world Bank Water Sanitation Programme report, 2012, indicates that poor sanitation is costing the country at least Shs389 billion annually. The money lost in three years can meet the cost of building the pit-latrines the country needs, which stands at Shs1.3 trillion. Depending on depth and usage, each pit- latrine takes not less than five years to fill, experts from Water Aid say.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Njeru-vendors-resort-to-buckets-to-answer-nature-s-call/688334-5067850-hvb5q6/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post29.png
30,What is Opposition s game plan for Busoga ahead of 2021 polls  - Daily Monitor,"Jinja. Opposition leaders are drawing strategies on how best they can garner support from Busoga sub-region ahead of the 2021 national elections.For the past two months, the Opposition has attempted to make inroads in the sub-region only for their efforts to hit a police brick wall.In all instances, they have failed to address urban residents and instead had their convoys diverted to the peripheries or in some instances, back to Kampala.The former Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) president, Dr Kizza Besigye, has reportedly held several covert meetings in the area since December last year. Are you for example aware that early this year, he (Besigye) travelled to Busia District, spent two days there and nobody noticed   said a source that did not want to be named because he is not the party spokesperson.The Democratic Party (DP) was on February 20 stopped from holding their highly anticipated reunion at Jinja Rugby Grounds.The DP president general, Mr Norbert Mao, who reportedly left Kampala for Jinja at 6am, was immediately upon arrival, placed into a waiting salon car and whisked to Jinja Central Police Station until 3pm when he was escorted out of Jinja.On March 16, police in Jinja fired teargas and live bullets to disperse supporters of Dr Besigye who had just been hosted on a radio talk show.Dr Besigye, who had during the talk show, urged Ugandans to oust President Museveni from power before the 2021 general elections, was promptly led to Budondo, on the outskirts of Jinja Town, from where he addressed his supporters.On March 28, police in Kaliro District blocked Dr Besigye, the FDC party president, Mr Patrick Oboi Amuriat, and other party officials from addressing rallies at Bulumba Trading Centre, Kaliro Town Council, and Lugonyola Landing Site, before dousing them with teargas.So, why is the Opposition trying, albeit with limited success, to attract Busoga s attention Mr Kenneth Kakande, the DP spokesperson, says their game plan is to sit with other Opposition parties and front a single person against NRM. Prof Oweyegha-Afunaduula, who has since retired to farming in Nawaka Village, Ikumbya Sub-county in Luuka District, says Busoga has been a vote basket for President Museveni since 1996. He says the strategy Mr Museveni has adopted towards Busoga is multi-pronged; ignorance, poverty and containment of the Opposition by using the military and police to exclude their activities from the area.By doing so, Prof Afunaduula says, the President s illusionary popularity in Busoga is sustained. The police could be clearing the Opposition to hold their rallies but knowing fully well that they can never be allowed to carry out their political activities in Busoga. Doing so could burst the myth of a popular Museveni in Busoga,  he adds. Prof Moses Khisa, an assistant professor of political science in the School of Public and International Affairs at North Carolina State University, does not think the Opposition has a viable game plan for Busoga or for the whole country. They are consumed in petty and infantile squabbles, thus it is difficult to see their compelling and overarching strategy. The FDC cannot promise a showdown when they have a divided house and are spending a lot of time directing their fury and fire at Bobi Wine,  Prof Khisa says. On what basis is the promised showdown  As for [Maj Gen Mugisha] Muntu working with Mao and Bobi [Wine] again, on what basis and with what modus operandi  Muntu has not shown that he has built any credible and strong political infrastructure on the basis of which he can cooperate or coalesce with other actors,  he adds.BattlegroundOn Busoga as a battleground, Prof Khisa says it has always been NRM s strategy to keep a stronghold on the sub-region.A source in FDC, who is familiar with this political jigsaw, says:  Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu wants to ally with Bobi Wine (Kyaddondo East MP) and Mao but for us we are planning for a showdown this year. However, Dr Frank Nabwiso, the former Member of Parliament for Kagoma County in Jinja District, says Busoga sub-region has always been taken for granted that they cannot demand for anything. FDC is fronting a new Busoga comprising people who are a bit militant. Apparently, it is that language that NRM leaders will accept,  Dr Nabwiso says. Nandala (Mafabi) has said many things using a militant voice on Bugisu Cooperative Union and government has bowed. FDC has had Mr Abdu Katuntu [Bugweri County MP] and Mr Paul Mwiru (Jinja East MP). However, Mr Katuntu has announced that he will not contest in 2021 while Mr Mwiru s political future is in the balance because he is leaning more onto former FDC party president, Gen Mugisha Muntu, than FDC,  he adds.Dr Nabwiso adds that Busoga has a big population of about four million people and about 38 MPs, including Speaker Rebecca Kadaga, and important government officials such as Hajj Kirunda Kivejjinja. In that regard, NRM can claim to be strong with the presence of those individuals in such positions,  he says.Dr Nabwiso regrets that the sub-region seems to lean on individuals and not a united front, wondering why  none  of the 38 MPs and 10 district chairpersons can meet President Museveni and tell what Busoga wants. I don t know what they (MPs and district chairmen) are afraid of. The biggest economic activity in Busoga is sugarcane farming. Lorries carry sugarcanes not food. Instead, the farmers use the money got from sugarcanes to buy food,  he says.The NRM s top most organ, the Central Executive Committee, during a retreat at Chobe Safari Lodge in the Murchison Falls National Park, Nwoya District, in February, set into motion President Museveni s re-election in 2021.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/What-is-Opposition-s-game-plan-Busoga-ahead-of-2021-polls/688334-5067878-105b0uv/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post30.png
31,High Court halts eviction of Kabale market traders - Daily Monitor,"KABALE. The High Court in Kabale has issued an interim order restraining Kabale Municipal Council and its agents from evicting, registering vendors, relocating traders and demolishing Kabale Central Market to pave way for its reconstruction until the main suit is heard and determined.The Kabale High Court assistant registrar, Mr Didas Muhumuza, on Wednesday issued the order following application for the same by traders under Kabale Central Market Traders Association (KCTA) in December last year. The traders argued that the registration exercise was not being done in a proper way.Hearing of the main suit has been set for June 11. In the suit, the traders say the registration was not done in a transparent manner because Kabale Municipal Council authorities conducted the exercise without establishing a joint team that was supposed to have their elected representatives.The market will be reconstructed at a cost of Shs25 billion under Markets and Agricultural Trade Improvement Programme (MATIP) funded by African Development Bank.Background The Kabale town clerk, Mr Joseph Monday, on April 1 issued a notice to all vendors and traders reminding them to vacate their business premises by May 1 to pave way for the reconstruction of the market.Mr Muhumuza in the ruling said the Kabale Municipal Council has not disclosed a relocation site on which all the traders and vendors shall be operating from during the period of reconstruction of the central market as required by the MATIP guidelines.  An interim order of injunction doth issue restraining the respondents (Kabale Municipal Council) or its agents employees, or workmen to halt the operations at Kabale Central Market or evicting the applicants (trader and vendors) there from and or closing off the Kabale central market premises and or relocating the said market vendors until the hearing and the disposal of the main application for a temporary injunction is fixed for hearing on June 11 or until further orders of this court,  Mr Muhumuza said.He added:  For avoidance of doubt and or in alternative, this interim order shall stay in force until the concerns raised by the applicants in the main application are addressed by the respondents. The other issue is signing a memorandum of understanding with the applicant to assure the members of allocation of lock up shops in the re-developed market after the project completion.Mr Timothy Twikirize represented the traders while Mr Grace Ndibarema represented Kabale Municipal Council.Traders responseThe traders expressed joy after the court ruling saying justice had been delivered.  We want our market to be reconstructed but also our rights must be respected. We thank court for delivering justice on this matter. Appointing strangers to conduct the registration of traders and failure by the Kabale Municipal Council to avail us with a relocation plan has been our worry,  Mr Simon Mashemererwa, the chairman of the traders said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/High-Court-halts-eviction-Kabale-market-traders/688334-5067896-c6li60/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post31.png
32,UWA to reward ex-poachers with domestic animals - Daily Monitor,"Kasese. In a bid to end rampart poaching, which reduced wild life in many conservation and game parks, Uganda wildlife Authority (UWA) has resorted to rewarding ex-poachers with domestic animals as an alternative for economic empowerment.More than 60 people, who denounced poaching from Mt Rwenzori National Park in 2017 and formed two groups; Kinyangeya and Mapata Anti  poachers associations, were on Wednesday rewarded with 10 piglets.Mr James Okware, the senior warden at Rwenzori Mountains National Park, said the 10 piglets will be shared by the two groups using the revolving system.Mr Okware said UWA has done all it can to protect wild life but poaching remains a big challenge. We at UWA have done a lot of community awareness about wildlife conservation, used different interventions but wildlife in the country has continued to dwindle the reason why we have now opted to rewarding the ex-poachers as an alternative means of survival,  he said.He added that the programme is aimed at spreading the message to all poachers that government has an alternative for them.Recovered We have given out 10 piglets to two groups as a way of gauging whether they can manage the project and once they look after them well, UWA shall add them more,  Mr Okware said.He revealed that so far three guns have been recovered and the number of poachers being arrested has increased due to community involvement and awareness. It is difficult now to tell whether poaching has reduced at this point but what I want to say is that poaching cases have increased due to vigilance since many incidents would go unnoticed but we shall be able to measure the success may be after five years and see the progress,  he said.UWA says the programme will be rolled out to other parts of the country once it registers success. The Kasese Resident District Commissioner, Lt Joe Walusimbi, cautioned the ex-poachers to surrender all the guns saying once they are caught they will be penalised. I want you to bring all our guns for you to be safe but if you don t and we get you, we shall not forgive you because you are an ex-poacher,  Lt Walusimbi warned.Mr Emanuel Kule, the secretary for Nyangonge  Mapata ex-hunters, said:  Ever since we denounced poaching few years ago, our children have suffered from malnutrition due to poor feeding, no money and herbal medicines among other benefits we have been getting from the park.  He added:  As we hand over our weapons to UWA today, we need you to give us alternatives otherwise it may not be easy for us to stay without meat. Mr Kule said they need to get clearance in order to get access to resources in the park as one way of improving working relationship between the communities and the park.SurrenderedLast week another group denounced poaching and handed over their weapons to UWA authorities at Ndugutu Secondary School, Bugoye Sub-county in Kasese.Ms Joy Biira, 45, said they decided to abandon illegal activities in the park after the four men who were leading them into the park lost their lives.Ms Peresi Kabugho said apart from getting the piglets the group is also engaged in bee keeping for economic empowerment.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UWA-to-reward-ex-poachers-with-domestic-animals/688334-5067920-uny9pg/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post32.png
33,Concern as refugees destroy forests - Daily Monitor,"YUMBE. The refugee settlements in Bidibidi has been rendered bare following destruction of trees for firewood, charcoal and building materials.Previously, Bidibidi was covered by natural trees and harboured a number of animal and tree species. The place in the early 1990s was also used as a hideout for the defunct rebels of Uganda National Rescue Front II of the late Ali Bamuze. Since the giveaway of the land by landlords and the local government, the trees have been cut down. On Wednesday, the State minister for Relief and Disaster Preparedness, Mr Musa Ecweru, expressed shock considering the high level of degradation. He said in the last two years, the areas have suffered about 58 per cent environmental destruction.  This is in a period of two years and if the refugees are going to be around for more 10 years, the area would become a complete desert then. We want to see partners acting by planting a lot of trees to replace the destroyed environment,  he said.The occasion The minister made the remarks while touring Bidibidi refugee settlement with a team of Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) steering group. Bidibidi settlement hosts about 224,000 South Sudanese refugees. Mr Ecweru said the partners must work with the Ministry of Energy and look at the possibilities of exploiting solar energy in order to reduce the cutting of trees. A water project initiated by Catholic Relief Services (CRS), one of the development partners in the settlement at Obomori Village in Zone 5, Odravu Sub-county, where water is pumped using solar power, excited the minister who said it is the way to go.  This has been a job well done by the partners but we want to emphasise that the local government of Yumbe should take up and own this project and sustain it when the refugees have returned to their country,  he added. The minister also encouraged the development partners and the community to promote the use of energy- saving stoves and briquettes so that the environment is saved. Mr Richard Matua, the commissioner for Ministry of Water and Environment, said:  This system of pumping water using the energy trapped from the sun is the only appropriate technology we can use to supply water to our communities in this area and this technology has been used elsewhere in other parts of the country and it is very affordable.  Mr Mohamed Dahir, the head of office for CRS in Yumbe, said:  This is a project with highest yielding borehole that we have developed into a hybrid water system and it is in two phases. The first phase cost $350,000 and we want to develop this into a second phase where we shall have more transmission lines and elevated tanks so that we reach more villages.  Ms Viola Kawaja, a refugee in Bidibidi Refugee Settlement, said the pressure on the environment is too much because of high dependence.   The trees are getting depleted and we want the project of planting of trees to start very soon because there is rain now. In case peace returns in South Sudan, we want to leave the place as green as we found it by planting more trees,  she said.Report Fuel consumption. In a report done by United Nations  Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 2017, it is estimated that fuel consumption on average per day per household in Yumbe District is 20kg and this translates into 3.5kg of fuel consumption per day per person. Accordingly, in a year, 223,000 refugees are expected to consume 347,408 tonnes of wood fuel and this is yet without inclusion of the host community. Concerning the population density, per square kilometre, there are 209 nationals but for refugees, per square kilometre, there are 3,000 refugees.

34,YouTube accidentally links Notre-Dame fire to 9/11 attacks- PHOTOS - Daily Monitor,"A YouTube fact-check feature which is meant to tackle misinformation accidentally tagged live broadcasts of a fire engulfing Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris with details about the 9/11 terror attacks.The blaze erupted in the UNESCO world heritage landmark in the French capital Monday, sending its spire and roof crashing to the ground as flames and clouds of smoke billowed into the sky.The fire, which at one point threatened the entire edifice, was brought under control early Tuesday about nine hours after it broke out.READ:Macron vows to rebuild Notre-Dame after devastating fire News outlets began live-streaming broadcasts of the fire on YouTube, but below some of the clips an unusual text box popped up -- an entry from the Encyclopedia Britannica about the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.In those attacks, Al-Qaeda militants hijacked two passenger planes and flew them into the towers of the World Trade Center in New York, causing them to collapse, while a third hijacked jet smashed into the Pentagon. Some 3,000 people were killed.Smoke and flames rise during a fire at the landmark Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris on April 15, 2019, potentially involving renovation works being carried out at the site, the fire service said.A spokesman for YouTube, which is owned by Google, said the text box feature had been disabled for live streams related to the fire.""These panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call,"" the spokesman told AFP. ""We are deeply saddened by the ongoing fire at the Notre-Dame Cathedral.""The feature, which also links to other outside sources such as Wikipedia, was introduced last year after YouTube faced intense criticism over videos containing misleading and extreme content. The panels are supposed to combat misleading videos about well-known events -- such as the first successful manned landing on the moon -- by presenting the true facts, in a bid to stop the spread of conspiracy theories.A man watches the landmark Notre-Dame Cathedral burn, engulfed in flames, in central Paris on April 15, 2019.

35,"Boeing under pressure amid cancelled flights, Trump tweets - Daily Monitor","Boeing faces a wave of flight cancelations by US airlines and pressure from President Donald Trump to rebrand its top-selling 737 MAX aircraft, a month after the plane was grounded worldwide in the wake of two deadly crashes.American and Southwest Airlines say the grounding will disrupt scheduled flights through the summer, during the peak travel season which helps generate corporate profits.American is cancelling all 737 MAX flights through August 19 while Southwest, which owns the largest 737 MAX fleet, with 34 planes, is cancelling them until August 5.United Airlines said it had previously used spare aircraft and ""creative solutions"" to keep from having to cancel flights but cancelations in the busy summer travel season could no longer be avoided.""No one knows when the FAA review will be complete, so we've decided to pull MAX flights out of our schedule through early July,"" a spokesperson told AFP on Monday.In all, an average of 275 flights a day will be cancelled, which are likely to put a dent in airline profits and could cause the companies to raise airfares.American already cut a key industry revenue metric -- Total Revenue per Available Seat-Mile, or TRASM -- saying it will rise one percent in 2019, down from a prior estimate of two percent.Southwest is allowing affected passengers to reschedule flights at no additional cost.""Neither Airbus nor Boeing like cancelations and there are stiff contracts which make this very difficult,"" said Scott Hamilton, managing editor of the aviation news site Leeham News and Analysis.""The companies will swap airplane types, however, if it comes to this.""All 737 MAX aircraft have been banned from the world's skies since mid-March after suffering two fatal crashes less than five months apart: a Lion Air flight crashed in the Java Sea in October, leaving 189 dead, and the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, which killed 157 people.Crash investigators have zeroed in on the planes' anti-stall system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.And Boeing, which has already ceased 737 MAX deliveries and slowed the pace of production, a buildup of delays could increase the penalties it must pay client airlines, Hamilton said.Trump tweeted early Monday that Boeing had to give its scandal-stricken aircraft a new image. Rebuilding trust ""What do I know about branding, maybe nothing (but I did become President!), but if I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name,"" he said.But Hamilton said Trump was right to doubt his own expertise.""Trump is a boob. Boeing isn't going to rebrand the 737,"" Hamilton said, pointing to Boeing's log of more than 4,600 backorders, a key sales revenue driver, and adding that the order cancelations so far were ""inconsequential.""Aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group agreed.""Pretty much all of President Trump's pronouncements on aviation are safely and best ignored,"" he said.Boeing is finalizing software upgrades for the MCAS, which it has pledged to submit to regulators in the coming weeks so that the 737 MAX grounding order can be lifted.""We're focused on testing and implementing the software update and rebuilding the trust of our airline customers, pilots and the traveling public,"" a spokesperson told AFP.""We know we have a deep responsibility to everyone who flies on our airplanes to ensure that the MAX is one of the safest aircraft ever to fly.""Rebranding the aircraft would impose additional costs on the airlines which would be required to fully retrain pilots, while an updated model involves less intense additional training.Flight cancelations show the airlines, that had hoped to have the planes back in the air by May, now expect it will be longer before the aircraft can return to service.Aviation analysts largely agree and expect the grounding to be lifted by the end of August.In the meantime, the industry is working to regain the trust of the flying public.The US Federal Aviation Administration, which must certify the 737 MAX's airworthiness, released a video last week in which its interim chief Daniel Elwell said the agency was working to keep pilots informed.The FAA also said the agency would not rush to get the 737 MAX flying again.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Boeing-under-pressure-amid-canceled-flights-Trump-tweets/688340-5073504-7y0kr5z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post35.png
36,Human Rights Watch calls for arrests in S.Africa after attacks on foreigners - Daily Monitor,"Human Rights Watch (HRW) urged South African authorities Monday to prosecute the perpetrators of deadly xenophobic violence that displaced some 300 Malawi migrants three weeks ago but has yielded no arrests.From March 25 to 27, mobs armed with metal rods and machetes broke into the homes of foreigners in Durban on South Africa's east coast, chasing them out and looting their belongings, HRW said. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has said at least six foreign nationals were killed and several injured, raising fears of a resurgence of xenophobic bloodshed in a country where poor, jobless people accuse migrants of taking their work and benefits.About 88 survivors of the Durban attacks asked to be sent back to Malawi as they felt unsafe, according to representatives of the Malawi High Commission.Others had no choice but to return to the same informal settlement they had been violently chased out of.""Re-integration of foreign nationals into communities without justice and accountability for past xenophobic attacks is a recipe for disaster,"" said HRW's southern Africa director Dewa Mavhinga. ""To deter those who attack foreign nationals, there is an urgent need for effective policing, arrests, and prosecutions.""The lack of arrests showed ""impunity for xenophobic crimes,"" said the rights watchdog.Widespread condemnation of the violence prompted emergency talks between South Africa's foreign and police ministers, Lindiwe Sisulu and Bheki Cele, and diplomats of African countries. HRW also urged politicians to refrain from statements that ""scapegoat migrants and feed anti-foreigner violence,"" ahead of May 8 general elections.It cited remarks by President Cyril Ramaphosa at a party rally in March, when he ""blamed undocumented migrants for problems and promised a crackdown"".The country hosts millions of foreigners, most from African countries and many undocumented.Immigrants bear much of the anger about chronic unemployment and limited economic gains made by poor black people since white-minority rule ended in 1994.Violence erupts sporadically, targeting foreign-owned shops and migrants themselves. Sixty-two people were killed in a wave of xenophobic violence in 2008, and at least seven in a fresh outburst in 2015.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/HRW-SAfrica-foreigners-Durban-Ramaphosa-police/688340-5072742-7imt6s/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post36.png
37,Game of Thrones fans fired up for final season - Daily Monitor,"Three hundred die-hard Game of Thrones fans laughed, howled and moaned their way through the premiere of the hugely popular fantasy saga's last season in New York on Sunday.More than an hour before the episode began, a crowd gathered at central Brooklyn's Understudy bar and broke into raucous shouts as the first notes of the famous theme music rang out.Almost 20 months after season seven finished, ""GoT"" aficionados finally got their fix -- and their fill of a Jon Snow cocktail, specially concocted for the occasion in honor of one of the main characters.The nine most tweeted words Sunday morning all had a link with the world created by author George R. R. Martin, a sign of the immense popularity of the HBO series.The name of character Bran Stark took first place, mentioned in more than 500,000 tweets by 0500 GMT. Bookmakers consider him the most likely to wrest power and reign over the seven kingdoms.A number of masks and get-ups were brought to the Brooklyn screening, with a homemade, Jon Snow-inspired costume with strong fantasy and medieval overtones the clear crowd favorite.One young woman with peroxide blond hair styled a la strongwoman Brienne of Tarth brought along a gnashing papier-mache dragon hand puppet she had made for the occasion.To add a little spice to the night, some fans played a game based on which character would survive the longest in the bloody, deadly world of Game of Thrones.The ruler with the wind now in her sails, Daenerys Targaryen, was selected by Jean-Louis Baron.""She must die, so she'll be the last to die,"" he said.""The whole world building is absolutely phenomenal,"" Baron added. ""It's a great escape"". Laughter and tears Many choose to watch the richly layered series at home so they don't miss any of the nuances, or have the option of watching a single scene multiple times.But some, like Robin Akyigit, decided to make an exception for the start of the final series and make it ""more of an event.""""One of the reasons why I wanted to be here was to get everybody's reaction,"" he said. ""I love hearing the audience.""""Luckily, the sound was great,"" said Alejandro Hernandez who had come up from Miami.""I was kind of afraid we were going to miss some of it because of everybody talking but everybody was pretty quiet when they needed to be.""The crowd of connoisseurs largely restrained their reactions -- but there were moments when they burst into laughter, and at times there were tears too.""I would definitely give it an 8 or a 9,"" said Hernandez after the lights came up, adding: ""It was pretty exciting to have them all back after so long.""

38,Bouteflika's mosque seen as monument to megalomania in Algeria - Daily Monitor,"Algeria's Abdelaziz Bouteflika may be gone, but his unfinished Great Mosque of Algiers looms large as a symbol of his 20-year reign and, many say, his megalomania.Built with the nation's vast oil wealth, the monument on the Bay of Algiers will be the world's third biggest mosque and Africa's largest, also boasting the tallest minaret anywhere at 265 metres (870 feet).From his car, Kader, a resident of the capital, looked at the impressive structure and conceded that ""it's true that it's beautiful"". ""But for me, it means nothing, this mosque,"" he added. ""It's just a pile of rocks.""The majestic white building, known locally as the Djamaa El-Djazair, sprawls across 20 hectares (50 acres), and its silhouette can be seen from across the capital region.But it has few defenders among the people of Algiers, where many dismiss it as a vanity project of the 82-year-old deposed leader and an immense waste of public money.The initial cost estimate of 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) has long been overrun and the construction, launched by a Chinese company in 2012, is more than three years behind schedule. Hospital shortage ""There are mosques every 500 meters in this country, we didn't need that,"" said an exasperated 68-year-old Zhora. Algeria, Africa's largest country, has more than 20,000 mosques. One of them, a small, immaculate neighbourhood mosque, sits about 100 metres behind the lavish structure in a residential district where laundry dries on the balconies of buildings dotted with satellite dishes. A 70-year-old resident sitting on the sidewalk recounted witnessing the impressive dome grow day by day from his window. ""It's true, it's a masterpiece, but... what we need are hospitals,"" he said.Algeria, with 40 million inhabitants, does slightly better than Morocco in terms of hospital beds per inhabitant, and somewhat worse than Tunisia, according to the WHO.The National Agency for Health Institutions in 2015 noted that Algeria's university hospitals date to colonial times and are ""mostly a century old"".Health workers' unions regularly denounce the lack of medical staff and equipment in public hospitals. ""I have nothing against this mosque, but these billions could have been used to improve a health system that really needs it,"" said Imene, a 26-year-old doctor. On social networks, petitions have been launched to transform the Great Mosque into ""Algeria's largest hospital"".  'They are thieves' With space for up to 120,000 faithful, the Great Mosque of Algiers will be the world's third largest after those in Mecca and Medina, Islam's two holiest sites, in Saudi Arabia. In addition to a 20,000-square-metre (215,280-square-foot) prayer room, it will include a Koranic school, library, cultural centre and vast gardens.To many Algerians, it symbolises the misguided vision of a leader who desperately clung to power despite age and illness, and his backers.""This mosque just shows that they are all thieves,"" said Fella, 52, who has been active in the protest movement against the ""system"" since it began on February 22.She said Bouteflika ""wanted to compete"" with regional rivals by overshadowing Morocco's Hassan II mosque in Casablanca and Tunisia's mosque built by another fallen autocrat, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.In Algiers, police still guard the construction site, which so far is only accessible to the workers.""Bouteflika wanted his mosque, that's all. This mosque is his mark,"" said Mourad, a 47-year-old resident. ""The worst thing is that we can't even get in there,"" he added.A few blocks away, 42-year-old shop owner Radia commented on the unfinished dream of Bouteflika, who has rarely been seen in public following a stroke in 2013 that affected his speech and left him wheelchair-bound.""Bouteflika made this great mosque for himself, and now he won't even be able to go and pray in it,"" she said",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Bouteflika-s-mosque-seen-monument-megalomania-Algeria/688340-5071996-eobeno/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post38.png
39,Professional course will add you clout - Daily Monitor,"A year after Ramarah Nakungu graduated with a Bachelors of Commerce, she had not found a job. She figured that despite her degree being an honours, she needed to get more qualifications to add weight to it. She thus enrolled at Uganda Management Institute (UMI) for Chartered Public Accountants (CPA). Now an auditor with EFC bank, she does not regret taking on the course. Although there are not many professional courses in Uganda, there is a chance for graduates to pursue any of the available ones as the membership will not only market you in Uganda but also globally. Vincent Owori, a lecturer in CPA and CIPS at Venus Business and Communication, says academic qualifications only help one to learn the theory part of the course as there is more to any course practically.  A course such as Certified Public Account (CPA) will make you stand out of the crowd of the many accountants. Students who undergo professional courses are looked at as problem solvers with better knowledge of handling their jobs,  says Owori. Is there a right time Abdullah Mayanja, the head of professional courses department at Uganda Management Institute (UMI), says the best time would be after a degree. Through the degree background, he says, the graduate has already come across some terms that will make concepts at the professional course easy to grasp.  However, one can enroll for a professional course after O-Level such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA),  Mayanja says. The hiring questionJoweria Nansereko, a human resource and administration manager at Graben 4pl Company in Bugolobi, Kampala, says companies hire professionals because they have edge above plain graduates.  A procurement manager with CIPS is equipped with more knowledge and practicability than one with only a degree,  she says. Why the fuss   Employers and company clients feel more secure and safer with someone they feel is equipped with all competencies necessary for the job,  Nakungu, a CPA, says. Because most professional courses are international, one who pursues it can work abroad if they have to or want to.  ACCA, a UK course, is recognised in more than 170 countries in the world,  says Mayanja.Some courses offered in Uganda  Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Association of Business Executives (ABE) Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM)[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Professional-course-will-add-you-clout/688336-5071398-i6krc9z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post39.png
40,Seeing students excel is my joy - Daily Monitor,"To Samuel Businde Saalongo, 38, nothing gives him more satisfaction than meeting technicians doing good work from institutions he has served in. Born to Edward Saalongo and Joyce Kalema, Businde is the principal, Lady Aidah Computer Based Institute of Fashion Design and Technology in Wakiso, and also patron Uganda Association of Private Vocational Institutions (UGAPRIVI) Kampala District chapter. He is also a duly registered technical instructor. Businde studied at Kezekiya Memorial Primary School in Rakai from 1987 to 93, then joined Kibaale Community Secondary School for O-Level and completed in 1999 with Aggregate 28. In 2000, I joined Kammengo Technical Institute with a goal to be a water engineer. I studied plumbing. This was a course least known to us by then but I was attracted to it because the sector was fast developing in Uganda,  Businde says. After he completed his Advanced level (Craft part Il) in 2003, and because he was an active student, the principal of the school then, (Charles Ebong) offered him an opportunity to start teaching. I eagerly accepted and he sent me to Kabira Technical Institute-Bushenyi in August 2003.  Young as I was, I went out ready to teach plumbing before our exams were even released,  he recalls.Since then, Businde never looked back but instead appreciated it more.  Teaching was very flexible. I even had time to get simple contracts of installing water in some buildings within Kabira and Ishaka Town as I trained students at the institute,  he says.Decision timeIn 2005, he decided to go back to school but this time to train as a teacher. He enrolled for an in-service Technical Teachers Education programme at Kal Institute of Technical Teacher Education (KaLIOTTE) where he got a certificate that made him register as a qualified teacher.In 2008, he joined the Royal Institute of Technical Teacher Education to head the department of plumbing and later on, was appointed deputy principal to coordinate academics and skills training at the institute. In 2009, Businde joined Kampala Polytechnic, Mengo to upgrade with a Diploma in Water Engineering for two years and in 2015 asked to serve as a visiting principal at Uganda Children s Centre Vocational and Technical Institute on Salaama Road.Through the ranksBusinde notes that growing through the ranks in vocational education requires thorough knowledge about the dynamics in the sector but he says he was able to do this because he had committed mentors who helped him actualise the leadership roles and as well as teaching.  Simon Kisasa, the former Uganda National Examinations Board deputy executive secretary and Emmanuel Bampiigga, the former national chairman UGAPRIVI, are the people who have continuously modelled me,  he confesses. Motivation  In leading and training, I aim at seeing people who go through my hands able to apply the skills acquired but also able to upgrade their studies. My core task is to make them get more informed so as to equally compete with the challenges in the world of work,  says Businde.Though one of the most evident challenges of vocational education in the country is the negative attitude by both parents and students especially due to lack of sensitisation, Businde is proud that more people, even professors have started to understand the impact of vocational education at all levels.It is also against this backdrop that he established a voluntary organisation; Change Education Attitude, Uganda, that goes around the country sensitising Ugandans, parents in particular, to embrace and harness vocational education. We make them appreciate that vocational education is purposeful because it introduces the students directly to the world of work and opens doors for advancing,  says Businde. Challenges Being a leader in a private vocational institute, he says, they encounter several challenges including, low enrollment of students, heavy taxes in procuring training materials, equipment and tools; and low fees charged by schools which makes running of these institutions difficult.  This results into poor remuneration which affects skills training and might lead to passing out incompetent personnel. Additionally, the public has not yet accepted that one can progressively go through technical education right from community polytechnic up to PhD,  he notes. Furthermore, Businde believes it is everyone s role to support Business Technical Vocational Education and Training (BTVET) by sensitising the public to realise the potential value in it.  I implore all of us to appreciate that the only way to fight unemployment and poverty out of Uganda is in BTVET,  Businde implores. Brief bio1987-1993.

41,Suicide: What is plaguing university students  - Daily Monitor,"On March 21, 2019 Ugandans woke up to news that Arthur Basalirwa, a student of Makerere University Business School (MUBS), had committed suicide. A few hours before his death, Basalirwa had posted on one of his social media accounts saying,  I am sorry but it s too late, I m sorry too much weighing on me, I do not want to live to see another day. Basalirwa had posted several other statements on social media earlier in the month which friends were later to realise were revelations that he was going through tough times but did not think deeply about them until they learnt about his death.In September 2018, Joshua Ajuna was found dead in his room in Nsibirwa Hall at Makerere University. Next to his body was a bottle of suspected poison and two suicides notes. According to the notes, personal reasons had driven Ajuna to kill himself. Earlier in April 2011, Francis Kigenyi, 23, had jumped to his death from the fifth floor of Baskon hostel on Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road in Kampala. Before his death, Kigenyi had told guests at his birthday party that his life was worthless and referred to himself as a ghost.Yet Joshua Nuwasasira, 22, a second-year student of Makerere University Business School, Mbarara study centre had in 2012, also committed suicide after he apparently spent every penny of his tuition fees on drinking and partying. He was found hanging in his rented room in Nkokonjeru, Mbarara.These are some of the suicide cases that have been reported at universities over the years, making the situation worrying. What could drive a student who is largely dependent on their parents to take their own life  DepressionAccording to Margaret Kyosaba Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, the main reason for suicides among university students is depression. She says this depression in most cases arises from maladjusted relationships, financial challenges, stress, academic anxiety, low self-esteem, drug abuse, poor performance, career indecision, uncertainty about post-school life and other informational needs. I have had chance to interact with some students who are contemplating suicide; most of them feel as though there is no way out of their situation. They are bombarded with feelings of hopelessness, fear, isolation, hatred toward themselves and so much more. The pain they feel is often immeasurable, to a point where they see no other option but to end their lives,  she explains.How can you tell Jean Nuwagaba, the head of counselling department Kyambogo University, says when a student is depressed, they may show signs of being overly sensitive to how they are perceived by others, their failures, and their relationships. They will also show signs of hopelessness, helplessness, unexplained fear of people, places, events, or objects (phobias), escapism, and general unusual or unacceptable behaviour such as drug abuse and unwarranted sexual escapades. She says sometimes some of these people overuse defense mechanisms such as denial, blame, and projection which are also indicative of mental health issues.Nevertheless, Nuwagaba says a student in such a state can get assistance through psychological interventions such as counselling, guidance, and other forms of psychosocial support.  Extreme cases should be taken to clinical psychologists or psychiatrists for further treatment,  she says.Sometimes students get depressed but fail to get anybody to talk to yet counsellors say talking can go a long way in helping one overcome painful circumstances.University intervention Ritah Namisango, the spokesperson Makerere University, says Makerere University (Mak) has a functional Counselling and Guidance Centre. The Mak Counselling and Guidance Centre is headed by a manager who is supported by professional counsellors. The managers and counsellors are fulltime members of staff at the university. The centre provides professional counselling services to both students and staff and the services are available to help students deal with and solve challenges of living that would otherwise affect their academic achievement and their wholesome being in general. She explains that the centre handles issues such as academics; for instance failure to understand or conceptualise what is taught and failure to make the required grades. It also handles psychological problems such as sexual dysfunctions, family problems, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, bereavement, and love relationships such as being dumped by a lover, failure to relate with a lover or other people, failure to quit an oppressive relationship, as well as psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, drug addiction, sexual harassment, HIV/Aids counselling.Apart from providing students with career guidance, the guidance and counselling unit provides first year students with a fresher s orientation where they explain to new entrants the dos and don ts of university life. During this fresher s orientation week, we give every new student at Makerere University an instruction booklet, which is meant to guide them on their life at university,  she says. This, she explains, is to minimise cases of transitional challenges.But Namisango is quick to note that the attendance of these guidance and counselling services is voluntary.At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.Luckily, she adds that the unit has handled quite a number of depression cases among students so far.  Ever since the inception of this facility, we have tried to popularise our services among students, by distributing flyers to students, notices on noticeboards around the university and making outreaches in student hostels,  she explains.Why are students adamant Unfortunately, some students are not embracing counselling and guidance services yet. According to Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, though universities have created counselling departments, some students are still skeptical to go in for these services. She says some are afraid of being seen by their peers obtaining such services. It is unfortunate that though counselling is very vital for university students, some find it uncalled for and shaming,  she says, adding that for this reason at Kyambogo, they have started online counselling services to help students who would prefer online to physical meetings. Namisango also admits that though the counselling services are free, some students opt out since they are not compulsory. Way forward Biribonwa says it is high time university students accepted that everyone gets depressed at some point in their lives. However, how long it lasts is one of the key factors to determine the severity.  If depression has lasted for more than two weeks and it is affecting your day-to-day life, it is time to get treatment,  she advises.Biribonwa insists that there is absolutely no shame in getting help adding that it is important for any student who is depressed to talk to friends and open up honestly about their feelings.  If you are feeling down, tell them that. If you need someone to talk to, tell them that, too. You might be surprised by how willing they are to help you get through it,  she advises.InterventionsStudent mentors. At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.

42,Why you need to check that school before sending your child there - Daily Monitor,"There are a number of advertisement activities that schools engage in to attract students which sometimes do not replicate what is on the ground. And a lot of times, some aspects which may impact on your child negatively might be happening at their school behind your back. Agnes Mweteise, was two years ago convinced to take her daughter to a school in Mbarara. She was largely excited about the school s performance in that year s O-Level results that were advertised extensively in the media.But a year after, the school s performance was different and a parent had raised the issue on how the administration always advertises wrong results to dupe them about the performance.  We were surprised when one of us armed with results from the newspaper cuttings found that they were not similar to those of Uganda National Examinations Board. The one advertised in the newspaper showed they had 10 students in Division One while those of UNEB showed that the school had got none,  said Mweteise who withdrew her daughter immediately. Milton Batekateka, a retired primary school teacher, blames the liberalisation policy in education and inadequate inspection, saying education officers should be keen on whatever material schools advertise in media. Mbarara district education officer, Gabriel Ahimbisibwe, warned that schools which dupe parents risk being de-registered and administrators arrested.  Any school found to be engaging in this practice will be de-registered. It is a very bad and dangerous strategy of attracting students,  says Ahimbisibwe. Low school charges Some schools charge rather very low school fees but are these commensurate to the services or what a student or pupil needs for his career development and social welfare Laban Kanywa, the chairperson Federation of Non State Institutions in Western Uganda, says parents should interest themselves in schools that charge very low school fees especially on how they go about the costs of running these schools. Those charging very low fees are only interested in the numbers but not in the standard of education. It is these schools where teachers are not paid or are unprofessional or starve students,  says Kanywa. Every TV, radio station and newspapers at the beginning of the school s term are awash with advertisements of schools. Adverts such as  we have professional staff, science laboratory, well-stocked library, swimming pool, and balanced diet , among others are common but as a parent do you take a step further to investigate whether these actually exist Andrew Kankiriho noted that the commercialisation of education has driven schools to employ all tricks to attract students. One of the schools here in Mbarara even duped the President. It claims to teach science and technology but when the President was going to visit the school, they hired old computers, welding and fabrication machines, sewing machines and forged a workshop, imagine,  said Kankiriho. He challenges parents to always do ground check on schools before enrolling children but added that even after they enrol, parents should always check on the capacity of the school to meet their expectations. Emotional violenceUnlike other forms of violence, emotional violence does not leave physical scars but wounds the heart which lowers one s esteem, dignity, and self-worth. It includes constant belittling, shaming, humiliating, negative comparisons, and frequent yelling and bullying. Nathan Mugume, the head teacher Mbarara Junior School, admits this kind of violence exists in schools and it has very disastrous effects even to a nation; such as having a violent nation. If a teacher is violent, abusive to pupils they may grow up to have violent and abusive families. As teachers we should guide, counsel, discuss and show empathy to pupils because we can either kill or build their future,  says Mugume.He says parents need to always interest themselves in checking their children s behaviour but also monitor the behaviour of school managers and staff towards the pupils.Third partiesDue to commercialisation of education, competition has forced schools to hire private brokers and agents who comb areas looking for students while spreading the  excellence  gospel of the schools.Unsuspecting parents easily get convinced by these brokers, forgetting that these are only interested in getting paid and whatever happens after is none of their business.  During our days, competition was driven by performance but now it is about the numbers you can attract just for economic gain. Why do you employ brokers if your school is sending pupils to first class institutions with good courses   Esau Muhangi, a retired secondary school teacher, asks.This is where the trouble lies. Pupils are in schools not just to learn but also make business for the proprietor.In case you check... Security. The general security at the school and in the neighbourhood should be safe. Care. Some teachers do not have proper handling of students even when they are disciplining them. Ability to teach. This is not just about having professional teachers but those who are able to teach.Hygiene. Are the toilets, latrine, kitchen, dining area and classrooms in good condition  Behaviour. The behaviour of students in a given school can give you a picture of whether it is a good school or not. Plans. Ask about the future plans of the school, especially if the school is new or just building up momentum.Performance. Consider student performance, not just in P7, S4 or S6, but the other classes too.Games. Ensure that the school pays attention and develops learners through co-curricular activities.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Check-that-school-before-sending-your-child-there/688336-5060788-hpnsow/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post42.png
43,Dedicated to pupils with special needs - Daily Monitor,"Maria Nansubuga Galiwango was supposed to be a journalist. That is what she longed for as a child. She thought that each of her days would be filled with an adventure of travelling to new places.Instead, after completing Senior Four, her elder brother encouraged her to become a teacher because of her love for children. That was the turning point as Nansubuga joined Gaba Teachers College where she graduated with a certificate in primary school teaching. It was the beginning of the journey into the unknown. She got a job at a school that she never thought would change her life forever.Tough startIn 2012, Nansubuga joined Hill Preparatory School, Naguru, kickstarting her journey in teaching.  I was given an inclusion class but that was a big challenge,  the 32-year-old said.An inclusive class has learners with disabilities and special education learning alongside their non-disabled peers. I had no interest at first. I was even afraid but after prayer I realised that this was a special group of people God had allowed me to reach,  Nansubuga recalls.As we sat for the interview, the love from the children was evident. A couple of them played with her while some hugged her, interrupting the session at several stages.Getting into the grooveA multi-talented teacher, Nansubuga later completed her diploma at Uganda Martyrs University-Nkozi in 2015 courtesy of the school director Clare Wavamunno and head teacher Ambrose Kibuuka. She attended several school trainings at Lugogo in Kampala which were regularly organised by Special Olympics Uganda as well as Umoja Global Community Music Therapy. The British Council also offered her an opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom in 2014 during an exchange programme to improve her skills of teaching special needs children.  I picked interest in furthering my knowledge of special needs education because I found these children amazing. They are so loving and I started seeing Jesus in them,  she said.Another dimensionNansubuga who teaches English and Mathematics, currently conducts private lessons at the convenience of the parents  homes for the last one year.Although she left Hill last year, she still goes there to conduct swimming lessons on a private arrangement.Nansubuga said she is now married to teaching even though she opted to start her private classes which she says offered her greener pastures. There are some parents who are still not comfortable bringing their special needs children in public and I find that an opportunity to reach out to them and help them develop,  she said.Nansubuga said she chose that approach because it is exciting yet she has a passion for seeing children with special needs excel. For special needs children, there s something new everyday, she says. They are fun and can be a challenge sometimes especially children with intellectual disabilities but we get to know each other. Nansubuga believes a good special needs educator is someone who has a passion for what they teach, and who you teach.  Being flexible and passionate is something I take pride in as an educator. I constantly talk to them to be able to build self-esteem. She was forced into swimming to tame autistic children who are normally hyper, especially after lunch making it necessary to curb extra energy.The common intellectual disability cases she has handled include; autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Each of those cases are handled differently and that is the best lesson I have learned in life. Everyone is different from the other,  she notes, adding that loving such children is what makes us human.Moving onNansubuga agrees that she cannot get all the money she needs from teaching as such she handles different projects. After opting to leave Hill Preparatory School last year, she joined Kampala International Pre-School in Naguru before she settled at Bourneville International School. She supplements this by working in a network marketing company, Success, which deals in cryptocurrencies. I do personal work with Success online and I never have to worry about my teaching appointments,  she says about her balancing act.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Dedicated-pupils-with-special-needs/688336-5060824-glwrmwz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post43.png
44,Are we sending pupils to boarding school too early  - Daily Monitor,"Gloria Namukisa sent her daughter to boarding school while she was in Primary Two. She says she was forced to make this decision by the challenges in commuting to school daily. But Namukisa also reveals, that is a decision she was later to regret.  I counselled her for several weeks before enrolling her; making her ready for the time I would not be around. I taught her how to wash her clothes, how to bathe, take care of her things, but also to psychologically prepare her to know that she will be responsible for most of her property. Most importantly I was encouraging her that everything would be fine,  she explains. However, things did not go as Namukisa expected.  Within two weeks, the other children had stolen her key, and swept her suitcase clean. The only thing she remained with were her bed sheets and blanket,  she recalls. But that was not all.  She came back a bit different. She would get nightmares and later told me that her fellow pupils told her that evil spirits come at night looking for children. She was also more selfish and did not want anyone to touch her belongings. This really got me rethinking my decision and what I needed to do,  she explains. Namukisa, a tailor, decided to move her tailoring shop to the neighbourhood she lived so that she could have her daughter in day school.Boarding schools are becoming more common than they were in the recent past. Originally the most common boarding schools were secondary ones. Today, almost every primary school has a boarding section and some schools have made it compulsory for some classes.  Growing up, my older siblings only joined boarding school in secondary school, and even then, my mother would remain worried that at Senior One they were still too young for boarding school. It was my father who always insisted on the move,  Faith Musinguzi, a parent, recalls.But thanks to the parents who have embraced boarding school in numbers, schools are admitting children from the age of five into the boarding sections. Seeing children aged as young as five standing next to mattresses and suitcases bigger than them on reporting day is now a common phenomenon. One wonders how a child who can barely do homework on their own will wash their clothes, take care of their possessions or themselves. Although nobody has earmarked the right age at which a child should join boarding school, the debate is; are we taking our children to boarding school too early  There are growing concerns that children are being sent to boarding school at a very young age and for some this has come with adverse effects on their lives. File photoBetter option Angella Ankunda, who took her now six-year-old daughter to boarding school when she was five, says in some cases, boarding school is a better option.  If you can leave a three-months-old baby with a house maid and go to work, it would be hypocritical to say that taking a five-year-old to boarding school is the worst thing one can do,  she asserts. She also argues that instead of leaving your child with a help who might expose them to some bad behaviour or abuse them, why not leave them at school where they will be in a more guided and controlled environment  Truth is, it is painful to part with your child at a very young age but circumstances often dictate to parents,  says Ankunda. But Matilda Namuyaba, a school matron at White Angels Primary School, Masajja, shares that although they try to give more attention to the younger pupils, they cannot provide all the care.  Since they are many, you cannot give all of them the maximum attention and care they deserve. So, some fall sick and you learn of it later when they are bedridden because they did not tell you or you were too preoccupied to observe. Some young ones even cry in the night when they want their parents, especially when they have just joined the school. Others are too stubborn to listen to you as the matron because they only listen to their parents,  she shares some of their challenges as caretakers. She further advises that a child should be sent to boarding school when they at least know the basics.  If a child is able to wash their clothes, bathe, fetch their own water, get their own meals and know when to eat, take care of their belongings and manage most of their affairs or relate easily with others, then these may find boarding school easier than those who cannot. Though we help them, we cannot do everything,  Namuyaba states. Psychological implications Lois Nakibuuka, a counselling psychologist, shares that parents or guardians are the first people who influence their child s life, view of the world and the people in it.  To be separated from them at a young age for boarding school gives them deep anxiety and bewilderment. This may even cause a child to wonder what they could possibly have done to deserve the punishment of being taken off to a strange environment and then try to cope on their own by non-social skills,  she notes. These may include; interacting and navigating the environment in an awkward, weird, or odd manner, antagonising others, teasing others frequently, being emotionally immature, among others. And other issues ranging from anxiety, low self-esteem. Emotional and mental scarring for life may also occur. The inability to sustain lasting emotional relationships may also be as a result of a child feeling unwanted. They may wonder that if they are not good enough for their parents to want them at home, how can they be good enough for anybody else to want them in their lives   Nakibuuka adds. She further advises that talking them through the reasons why you are taking them to boarding school way ahead of time will allow them to wrap their heads around the idea and get used to it.  Tell them about the situations that are leading them to this difficult solution. For example; if a child has to navigate a long route to school, ask them what danger they could encounter and how it can be solved. Point out the advantages of being in boarding school but also tell them what to expect realistically,  she says.The performance issue However, amid the debate on age and boarding school is the delusion; by teachers, school owners and parents that boarding school equals great academic results.  My son has always been an average student right from primary school though he was in boarding school. But when he joined secondary school; day section, the teachers started pestering me to bring him to boarding section. Every time they invited us for a parent s meeting to look at their assessment marks in the remedial examinations, the one and only solution that all teachers had to his poor results was enrolling him in the boarding section,  Geoffrey Kazibwe confesses. He recalls teachers advising that when he enrols his Senior Two son into boarding section, he will be surprised at how drastic his grades would improve.  They used this marketing language like they were more concerned about his grades than I was, that it made me think that probably, the teachers get a commission on every student who enrols in the boarding section!  Kazibwe asserts. Other alternativesRichard Muhumuza shares that there are some alternatives parents can consider.  For example, I still felt that my Senior One daughter was still too young for boarding school. What I did was to have her in a student hostel owned by her school (Mengo Secondary School). She stays at hostel during weekdays but comes back home for the weekend,  This way, he is able to strike a balance between her study time and time with her. There are some primary and secondary schools that offer weekly boarding to students such as Greenhill Academy and Rainbow International School. Alternatively, home-schooling may be the way to go for some parents. All the parent has to do is hire a qualified teacher to teach their child. This is not only convenient, but will also give the parents ample time with their child. However, Emmanuel Mugarura, the head of education at Kampala Smart School, an organisation that offers home-schooling services, says before parents choose to home-school their children, there are key aspects to note such as designing a personal learning plan and academic framework for the child.  This includes selecting a curriculum, instructional resources, learning applications and continuity plans,  he explains. Mugarura adds that a parent needs to also have the chance to provide weekly opportunities where the child meets with other children for interaction to boost their social skills. Some education experts argue that 10 should be the minimun age at which a child should join boarding school which is not the situation on ground. PHOTO BY ALEX ESAGALAExplore onlinePauline Mukisa, an online course moderator and digital enthusiast, shares that learning can now be online.  The only challenge so far is that local content may be limited, but a child can apply for an international curriculum in an international school and then study online. The thought may still be far from many people s minds but it could be something to look at, especially now that more people are embracing digitisation,  she says. For parents intent on keeping their children in a day school environment, a purely day school could be the solution for you.  The advantages of purely day schools is that the classes are timetabled in a way that will be convenient for all students. Classes start at 8am and end at 5pm to allow students time to move back home in time. It is usually candidate classes that have remedial classes that begin at 7am to 6pm. Additionally you will not get the school administration ordering you about a mandatory boarding section because they do not have the section in the first place,  Henry Bukembo, a teacher and parent, shares. Views on what should be the right time to take a child to school are divergent from one person to another. However, the International journal of Education and research on  The influence of boarding school to young children  (a case of Tanzania, 2016) refers to Ellen G. White s view that the suitable age for children to go to boarding school is that of 10 years. The journal also refers to the Kenyan parliament s decision in 2002 that the proper age for boarding school should be 12 years, when children are old enough.An illegal move Frances Atima, the assistant commissioner in the Directorate of Education Standards (DES), noted that boarding section arrangement is purely facilitated by parents and that government policy only emphasises access to quality education. He said this during the release of a DES report made after a survey on the standard of boarding schools in the country in November last year.The report also said 70 per cent of secondary schools are illegally operating boarding sections, having sought no permission from the relevant agencies. Atima explained that any institution which wants to have a boarding section must apply separately, be inspected and if they meet the minimum standards, be given authority to operate. Of the 800 secondary schools inspected, only 30 per cent of the schools complied with the required standards.  We already raised the red flag that many schools are operating boarding facilities without authority from the ministry. No school is registered as day and boarding other than the traditional schools, which were there in the early years,  Atima said.Is boarding school necessary Moses Kisekka, a teacher at St Kizito Primary School, shares that although boarding school has its own challenges to a child, it is necessary to impart some life skills. Though a child may be young, boarding school gives them more challenges to become responsible over their own property and life. For example, they may eat their edibles or waste their money the first time, and from that, they learn how to eat responsibly and use things sparingly, which is a skill everyone needs.He further emphasises that boarding school provides a good environment for a child to fully engage in education related activities with little distractions. Kisekka also notes the fact that boarding school can offer a better environment, especially for children who come from violent and abusive homes, who walk long distances to get to school among other circumstances.

45,"Landscaping, a new vocation course to try - Daily Monitor","Chrissy Ethel Namono, is a former accountant who loves beautiful spaces and was determined to turn that love into a job.  After working a few jobs as an accountant, I decided to quit for my passion,  the landscaper and founder Iconic Hedges, shares.  I did not grow up in a beautiful home, but when I travelled to other countries such as Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, among others, I appreciated how organised most of their homes and compounds were,  she states.In addition, every time she visited a home, she found herself rearranging it in her mind, and with time, she realised she could do more than just imagine. I only had Shs800,000 as starting capital which I used to buy a mowing machine. Clad in overalls, and a mowing machine in hand, I would move door to door looking for clients. Sometimes I would be mocked but I never gave up,  she recalls.As a landscaper, her first client was a home Namono had mowed earlier but found their compound out of shape.  I asked them whether I could put their compound back in shape. I rendered the service and the compound came out perfectly,  she exclaims.Lucrative jobIt is these that started recommending her services to other people leading to the birth of her own company - Iconic Hedges in 2016.To improve her skills, Namono had to pursue a Certificate in Landscaping with Design Concepts in Dubai, UAE. And in addition to this, she did an online design courses from Real Time Architecture.As more people appreciate beautiful homes, landscapes and gardening, in 2011, the Ministry of Education and Sports, under its Business Technical Vocational Education and Training programme rolled out an Assessment and Training Package for landscape gardeners (Level 1) for schools that train landscape gardeners. One such school is CIDI Training Centre for Gardening and Landscaping in Kampala. Edward Mutebi, 19, is a student pursuing a two-year Certificate in Landscape and Gardening at CIDI who joined the course after Senior Four.  It was difficult to choose what I would do but when I learned about gardening and landscaping, I thought that would work for me since I had studied Agriculture at O-Level and had passed it with a D2,  he shares. The first two weeks were challenging for Mutebi, especially having to learn botanical names of plants and flowers, but after counselling at the school, he was encouraged. We started going to the field and it became interesting. We would go to maintain compounds and plants, sometimes even setting a garden in place,  he recounts. Four weeks into the course, Mutebi started earning.  Recently I landscaped for a client in Bukasa, Muyenga. I designed the compound, mixed flowers and also did an accent plant for her. I earned more than Shs400,000 from this job,  he notes.About the course According to Rosemary Nampindi, a second-year student at CIDI, one of the course units is on landscape   which includes compound designing, drawing/ making compound plans, implementing a plan, maintenance of gardens. There is softscaping which deals mostly with plants and hardscaping that is composed of setting up areas, designs, platforms using constructive materials. We also study urban agriculture, which includes smart agriculture.

47,"Finance officials who  ate  $50,000 bribe sent to jail - Daily Monitor","Kampala. The Anti-Corruption Court yesterday sentenced two former Finance ministry officials, who were arrested for soliciting a bribe from an investor in 2017, to two years in prison and banned them from holding public office for 10 years after serving their jail term.Former principal finance officer John Charles Ogol and Geoffrey Turyamuhika, alias Tumwine, a senior economist, were convicted of corruption for receiving a gratification of $50,000 (about Shs186m) from a one Hassan Sserunjogi on March 27, 2017.The convicts received the money to expedite documentation for financing the construction of a power substation and transmission line at Osukuru Phosphate project in Tororo District. Ogol and Turyamuhika were also fined Shs4.8m each. The judge reasoned that the punishments were aimed at balancing the efforts of the state to fight corruption and the hardships dependants would have when the convicts are incarcerated. I am inclined to impose a sentence that would communicate the message that corruption if proven in this court would attract punishment. At the same time, the sentence would not be such as to keep away the convicts from supporting their families for too long considering that what they had received as a bribe was seized and exhibited in court,  the trial judge Lawrence Gidudu ruled.  The court would not impose a sentence that is laughable to the extent that it would encourage persons to commit the same crime hoping that they would walk in and out even after being convicted without being scratched as a constant reminder that corruption is bad,  he added.The court also ordered that the money exhibited in court be returned to State House Comptroller while the convicts be given their bail money of Shs8m and their handheld phones be returned to them.Ogol, 59, and Turyamuhika, 38, were technical officers at the Finance ministry responsible for handling issues concerning investors.Court heard that the investor trading as Guangzhou Dongsongh Energy Group Uganda Limited wanted to establish a factory at Osukuru in Tororo to manufacture phosphates and other products.The investor needed power to run the factory complex but government did not have ready money to build a power substation.The indictment shows that the investor was willing to finance the power project if government could guarantee to refund its money.Justice Gidudu said the challenge seems to have arisen when the investor wanted to move faster because of the pressure it had from its bankers who had advanced loans that it was not utilising yet it was subject to paying interest. The convicts saw an opportunity to make quick buck and demanded to be paid a bribe upfront. When a deposit of $50,000 was paid, they shared it out,  he said.However, Justice Gidudu acquitted the convicts on the charge of corruption in connection with soliciting another gratification of $300,000 (about Shs1.1b) from Sserunjogi. The prosecution did not address me on the irregularity in their final submissions. It is my conclusion that the prosecution did not prove the charges against the accused persons beyond reasonable doubt,  he ruled.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Finance-chiefs-convicted-barred-office-10-years/688334-5073340-obabsr/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post47.png
48,Development of Kingfisher awaits pipeline decision - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Energy, Mr Robert Kasande, yesterday said the announcement of Final Investment Decision (FID) for the Kingfisher and Tilenga oil fields is dependent on the FID of the proposed East African Crude Oil Export Pipeline.FID is an agreement on capital investments on a long term project, that is when money for the project is availed and execution starts. FID is expected to pave way for the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) phase and subsequently commencement of commercial of oil production. We would not want to develop an oil field without the attendant facilities which means it will lie there idle. So we have synchronised the Kingfisher FID to that of the pipeline and Tilenga so that we move at once,  Mr Kasande told journalists at the ministry offices in Kampala.Kingfisher is operated by China s Cnooc while Tilenga is under French Total E&P.Energy minister Irene Muloni said government and Cnooc were looking at announcing FID for Kingfisher before the end of this month.Government and oil companies are currently targeting early October to announce FID for development of Kingfisher, Tilenga and the oil pipeline but regardless of when it is eventually taken, Uganda s first commercial oil is three years from FID, that is 2023.Each time the FID date slips, so does the production start date.Cnooc operates Exploration Area 3 (Kingfisher) in south of Lake Albert, and the southern fields Waraga, Mputa and Nzizi of Exploration Area 2, initially operated by Anglo-Irish Tullow before it sold them off.Mr Kasande also said technical Front End Engineering Designs, environmental studies for Tilenga oil fields at the northern end of Lake Albert in Nwoya and Buliisa districts, was approved last month, adding that  integration of comments  and review of the company s Environment Impact Assessment report is ongoing.Acquisition of 700 acres of land in Buliisa for Tilenga s attendant facilities faced hindrances after six project affected persons rejected the Shs3m compensation offered per acre and have insisted on being paid Shs21m.Development of the Tilenga oil fields is estimated to cost about Shs14 trillion ($4b).Discussions on development of the Shs13 trillion pipeline by Uganda, the three oil companies Total E&P, Tullow and Cnooc, and Tanzania are ongoing.In a related development, Mr Kasande said ongoing surveys for hydrocarbons (oil and gas) around the country have returned positive results in the Kadam-Moroto basin in northeastern Uganda, adding that they hope to licence the area. CapacityThe current stock tank of oil in place from the roughly 40 per cent area of the Albertine Graben in South Western Uganda explored so far, is 6.5 billion, with 1.7 billion recoverable, and about 500 billion cubic feet of gas resources.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Development-of-Kingfisher-awaits-pipeline-decision/688334-5073336-5v6v0b/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-16/post48.png
