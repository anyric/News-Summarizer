0,"'First' 3D print of heart with human tissue, vessels unveiled - Daily Monitor","Scientists in Israel unveiled a 3D print of a heart with human tissue and vessels on Monday, calling it a first and a ""major medical breakthrough"" that advances possibilities for transplants.While it remains a far way off, scientists hope one day to be able to produce hearts suitable for transplant into humans as well as patches to regenerate defective hearts.The heart produced by researchers at Tel Aviv University is about the size of a rabbit's.It marked ""the first time anyone anywhere has successfully engineered and printed an entire heart replete with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers,"" said Tal Dvir, who led the project.""People have managed to 3D-print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels,"" he said.But the scientists said many challenges remain before fully working 3D printed hearts would be available for transplant into patients.Journalists were shown a 3D print of a heart about the size of a cherry, immersed in liquid, at Tel Aviv University on Monday as the researchers announced their findings, published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Science.Researchers must now teach the printed hearts ""to behave"" like real ones. The cells are currently able to contract, but do not yet have the ability to pump.Then they plan to transplant them into animal models, hopefully in about a year, said Dvir.""Maybe, in 10 years, there will be organ printers in the finest hospitals around the world, and these procedures will be conducted routinely,"" he said.But he said hospitals would likely start with simpler organs than hearts. Producing 'ink' A 3D print of heart with human tissue.In its statement announcing the research, Tel Aviv University called it a ""major medical breakthrough"".Cardiovascular disease is the world's leading cause of death, according to the World Health Organization, and transplants are currently the only option available for patients in the worst cases.But the number of donors is limited and many die while waiting.When they do benefit, they can fall victim to their bodies rejecting the transplant -- a problem the researchers are seeking to overcome.Their research involved taking a biopsy of fatty tissue from patients that was used in the development of the ""ink"" for the 3D print.First, patient-specific cardiac patches were created followed by the entire heart, the statement said.Using the patient's own tissue was important to eliminate the risk of an implant provoking an immune response and being rejected, Dvir said.""The biocompatibility of engineered materials is crucial to eliminating the risk of implant rejection, which jeopardises the success of such treatments,"" said Dvir.Challenges that remain include how to expand the cells to have enough tissue to recreate a human-sized heart, he said.Current 3D printers are also limited by the size of their resolution and another challenge will be figuring out how to print all small blood vessels.But while the current 3D print was a primitive one and only the size of a rabbit's heart, ""larger human hearts require the same technology,"" said Dvir.3D printing has opened up possibilities in numerous fields, provoking both promise and controversy.The technology has developed to include 3D prints of everything from homes to guns.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-First--3D-print-heart-with-human-tissue-vessels-unveiled/688334-5075752-hkamy6z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post0.png
1,Sudan's Bashir transferred to prison in Khartoum - Daily Monitor,"Sudan's military rulers have transferred ousted president Omar al-Bashir to prison, a family source said Wednesday, as demonstrators keep up their sit-in outside the army complex calling for a swift transfer to civilian government.Following the dramatic end to Bashir's rule of three decades last week, he was moved late Tuesday ""to Kober prison in Khartoum"", the source said without revealing his name for security reasons.Witnesses near the prison in north Khartoum said there was a heavy deployment of soldiers and members of a paramilitary group outside.The 75-year-old's whereabouts have been unknown since a military takeover on Thursday, when the country's new rulers said he was being held ""in a secure place"".The detention of Bashir has failed to pacify protesters, who launched anti-government demonstrations in December and have for days been camped out in front of Khartoum's army headquarters.Sudan's military rulers have made some concessions to protesters, including the sacking Tuesday of prosecutor general Omer Ahmed Mohamed, but demonstrators fear their uprising could be hijacked.""We faced tear gas, many of us were jailed. We have been shot and many have died. All this because we said what we wanted to,"" protester Fadia Khalaf said.Officials say at least 65 people have been killed in protest-related violence since December, with some of those killed immortalised in a Khartoum mural.While there have been scenes of celebration -- with demonstrators singing and waving their national flag -- the protest site has grown more tense amid concerns the army will try to clear the sit-in with force.""Now we fear that our revolution could be stolen, which is why we are keeping our ground here. We are staying here until our demands are met,"" said Khalaf.Earlier this week witnesses said several army vehicles had surrounded the area and that troops were removing the barricades which demonstrators had put up as a security measure. AU warns military rulers On taking power on Thursday the army said a military council would run the country for two years, sparking an immediate backlash from protest leaders who have issued a series of demands.Just a day later former defence minister General Awad Ibn Ouf stepped down as council chief, sparking jubilation on the streets of Khartoum.His successor General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan oversaw weekend talks with political parties, which failed to make headway.Sudan's foreign minister has said Burhan is ""committed to having a complete civilian government"" and has called on other nations to back the council.The military rulers dispatched an envoy to the African Union's headquarters in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, but the regional bloc threatened to suspend Sudan over the coup.The 55-member union has given the military council just 15 days to hand over to civilian rule, while the United Nations has appointed a new envoy to work with the AU on mediating an end to the crisis.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have thrown their support behind the military, whose troops are set to remain in an alliance led by the Gulf powerhouses in Yemen.Western powers which previously called on Bashir to heed protesters' demands have continued to back the demonstrators, pushing for a civilian administration in talks with military rulers.READ:Uganda willing to give Bashir asylum- government",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Sudan-s-Bashir-transferred-prison/688334-5075648-31dw3e/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post1.png
2,Government inaugurates new UIA board today - Daily Monitor,"Kampala- Privatization and Investment Minister Evelyn Anite is today expected to inaugurate the new board of Uganda Investment Authority with a call to speed up job creation in the country. The Minister of state for Investment and Privatization will [today] officially inaugurate the new Uganda Investment Authority Board (UIA),  the Media Centre alert reads in part. The inauguration of a new board chaired by Mr Emely Kugonza who was also the chair of the disbanded board comes after Finance Matia Kasaija, in a February 6 letter, copied to Ms Anite said effective April 1 the entire board would be terminated. The new board members were given on a three-year contract in spite of the fact that UIA was named among several government agencies to be scrapped and merged with others. The proposed merger seeks to ensure efficacy and reduce on wasteful expenditures.Other board members are Mr. Fred Opolot, Mr Morrison Rwakakamba, Mr Joshua Mutambi, Mr Godfrey Byamukama Kerere, Ms Ombombasa Naima and Ms Getrude Kutesa Lutaaya.When contacted, Ms Anite confirmed the inauguration of UIA board and explained that the Investment Code Act 2019 reduced the membership of UIA board from 13 to seven in order to ensure efficiency and cut costs.  This is Kisanja Hakuna Mchezo, as government, we have carefully selected these people because we want results. Ugandans want serious investors who will create jobs and pay taxes ... we don t want brief case investors,  Ms Anite told this website on Wednesday.The precious board was dissolved after the President signed the law on February 20. The new UIA board members were cleared by Cabinet last month following weeks of consultations and background checks.The Investment Code Act 2019 seeks to cut red tape, speed up job creation and investment promotion in the country. The new law provides a mechanism of dealing with local and foreign investments in Uganda and promises favourable conditions for investment and other related matters.In his 2016 job creation plan, Mr Museveni sought to create at least 1,000,000 jobs before the end of his tenure in 2021. However, it s not clear how many jobs the government has created since 2016.Role of UIAUganda Investment Authority (UIA) is a semi-autonomous government agency which drives national economic growth and development in partnership with the private sector. As an Investment Promotion Agency, UIA mainly: markets investment opportunities; promotes packaged investment projects; ensures local and foreign investors have access to information, especially about the business environment so as to make more informed business decisions; and offers business support, advisory and advocacy services.NEW UIA BOARDBoard Chairman1.

3,'Circumcision caused my son s suicide' - Daily Monitor,"Lesley Roberts was stunned as she read the devastating final email from her beloved son Alex Hardy.The email had been timed to arrive on 25 November 2017, 12 hours after he killed himself. Less than an hour before the email arrived, Lesley had opened her front door to find a police officer standing there, explaining her son was dead.Alex was an intelligent and popular 23-year-old with no history of mental illness. Lesley could not understand why he would have wanted to take his own life.His email explained how the foreskin of his penis had been surgically removed two years before. This is commonly known as circumcision, but Alex had come to believe it should be regarded as ""male genital mutilation"".He never mentioned this to his family or friends when he was alive. Lesley did not even know her son had been circumcised.In the following months, she tried to find out more about circumcision. Why had it affected Alex so badly, and why did he feel killing himself was his only option Alex was the eldest of Lesley's three sons and had been very much longed for, having been conceived after fertility treatment.Lesley says her ""dreams came true"" when she became a mother in July 1994.""He was everything I could have wished for,"" she says. ""Gorgeous, easygoing, and adoring of his younger brother Thomas who arrived following more treatment almost three years later.""He also adored his baby brother James, who was born when Alex was 13. The walls and windowsills of Lesley's home in Cheshire are covered in photos of all of them.Alex sailed through his education and was particularly gifted at English, so much so that his old school established the Alex Hardy Creative Writing Award in his memory.""Alex was passionate about history but as his English teacher I saw in him a true talent for writing,"" says Jason Lowe, who is now head teacher at Tarporley High School.It was while on a school skiing trip to Canada, aged 14, that Alex fell in love with the country. He had enjoyed skiing as a child and the trip reignited his passion. So, when Alex reached 18, he decided to defer university and live in Canada for a year.""He fell in love completely with Canada and made so many friends and got a promotion at work,"" says Lesley.""After one year he rang me and said 'Mum, I'm deferring my place for university'. The same thing happened after year two.""Two years turned into three, then four, and by the time of his death Alex had been living in Canada for five years and had obtained residency.""He was known as the 'super-smart Brit' with impeccable manners,"" says his mother. ""The super-intelligent guy from the UK who helped people with their Canadian residency applications.""Lesley visited her son several times, both alone and with his brothers and stepfather. They were a close family, but Alex did not tell any of them he was secretly suffering with a problem with his penis.""I had issues with a tight foreskin,"" he eventually wrote in his final email, ""but from my late teens it created issues in the bedroom as it meant my foreskin would not retract over the glans as intended which caused some awkward moments.""The foreskin protects the head of the penis, known as the glans. Getty ImagesIn 2015, still silently suffering, Alex consulted a doctor in Canada. He was given steroid cream to stretch his foreskin, but went back to the doctor after just a few weeks because he did not think the treatment was working.The medical name for Alex's problem is phimosis. It simply means his foreskin was too tight to pull back from the head of his penis, or the ""glans"" as Alex referred to it in his email. This is perfectly normal for boys in the early years of their life. As boys get older, their foreskin usually starts to separate from the head of the penis.Phimosis does not always cause problems, but if it does, problems can include difficulty urinating and pain during sex. In England, the NHS advises topical steroids and stretching techniques - and circumcision as a last resort.Over in Canada, where circumcision is more common, Alex was referred to a urologist.""He immediately suggested circumcision,"" Alex wrote. ""I asked about stretching and he completely lied to my face and said it would not work for me.""I was mostly trusting as I felt he was the expert who knew best in this regard so with a pinch of salt I accepted it.""Lesley has since read online reviews of this urologist which have made her question his competence. One patient said she had been unable to work since having surgery for kidney problems, and he had ""destroyed"" her quality of life.""I'm a mother of three young children who are scared every day I will die as they see me suffering in so much pain,"" she wrote.""I can see how he misdiagnosed others, botched surgeries, and ruined lives,"" said another review. ""He's dangerously incompetent.""Another review of Alex's urologist read: ""They left a surgical instrument in my bladder but I only got notified three months later. Run away before you get hurt!""Lesley, who was ""horrified"" by these reviews, has asked for the urologist to be investigated. She has been told an inquiry is ongoing.READ:The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia told the BBC it ""cannot disclose the existence of a complaint against a physician, and only may do so if the complaint leads to formal discipline"".""I will wish with my last breath and with all of heart that my darling son had run away,"" says Lesley.Much to his regret, Alex was not able to research the urologist - or circumcision - properly at the time because his laptop was broken.He had tried researching the topic in a public computer space but felt uncomfortable, and also felt it was ""too much of a taboo"" to discuss with friends.So Alex booked what he believed was a minor procedure and had the surgery in 2015, at the age of 21.""It quickly became apparent that what had just happened was a catastrophe,"" Alex wrote in the email to his mother.He attached a much longer public statement in which he explained, in great detail, the physical problems he had suffered after being circumcised.He described experiencing constant stimulation from the head of his penis, which was no longer protected by his foreskin.""These ever-present stimulated sensations from clothing friction are torture within themselves; they have not subsided/normalised from years of exposure,"" he wrote.""Imagine what would happen to an eyeball if the eyelid was amputated """"He was in so much pain that it hurt to do normal physical activity,"" says Lesley. ""He was a keen skier and snowboarder so you can imagine the pain he was in.""Consultant urological surgeon Trevor Dorkin, who is a member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, advises his patients that the head of their penis will be more sensitive after circumcision.However, this sensitivity usually reduces.""I always say to guys 'it's going to feel more sensitive to start with' because all of a sudden you haven't got this protection over the head of the penis and it will feel different,"" says Mr Dorkin, who has carried out more than 1,000 circumcisions.""But in the vast majority of the cases the man adjusts to that, the brain adjusts to that, it adjusts to the signals that are coming back through the nerves from the head of the penis.""Alex also wrote about experiencing erectile dysfunction, and burning and itching sensations, particularly from a scar which sat where his frenulum was removed. The frenulum is a band of tissue where the foreskin attaches to the under surface of the penis. Some men refer to it as their ""banjo string"".""It's one of the more erogenous zones so it's thought to be important in sexual function,"" says Mr Dorkin.""The foreskin, the head of the penis and the frenulum is a very, very sensitive area.""But again when you do circumcision sometimes the frenulum is not preserved and it doesn't necessarily have an effect on overall sexual function and enjoyment.""But Alex felt his frenulum had been important.""Through its absence I can certainly verify it is the most erogenously sensitive area of the penis and male body overall,"" he wrote.""If someone were to amputate your clitoris you may begin to be able to understand how this feels.""He wrote about experiencing cramps and contractions in his muscles and ""uncomfortable"" sensations which extended deep into his abdomen.Lesley does not know whether or not Alex had sex after his circumcision.""Where I once had a sexual organ I have now been left with a numb, botched stick,"" he wrote. ""My sexuality has been left in tatters.""RelatedHe asked: ""Nature knows best - how can chopping off a section of healthy tissue improve nature's evolved design ""Like many people, Lesley admits she knew very little about the foreskin or circumcision before her son died.""I didn't know anything apart from I believed it was a very routine surgery,"" she says.The foreskin is sometimes dismissed as a ""useless flap of skin"", but Mr Dorkin says it does have a purpose.""It covers the head of the penis,"" he says. ""In terms of what's it for, it provides a bit of protection to the head of the penis. It's thought to have some sort of immunological function perhaps.""Circumcision rates vary a lot depending on where you are in the world and which culture you grew up in.According to the World Health Organization, 95% of men are circumcised in Nigeria but only 8.5% of men in the UK are.Most of the men circumcised in the UK are either Muslim or Jewish, as circumcision is regarded as an important part of their religions.According to the 2011 census, Muslims accounted for 4.8% of the population in England and Wales, while 0.5% were Jewish.People who question circumcision are sometimes accused of being anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, but Lesley stresses her son was neither.""For me, this has nothing to do with religion at all. I respect all people of faith or indeed no faith, as Alex did,"" she says.In Canada, where Alex had moved to, an estimated 32% of men are circumcised.Alex felt male circumcision has been normalised to the extent that most people do not question it, while female circumcision has become known as female genital mutilation (FGM) and is now illegal in many countries.He felt male circumcision should be known as ""male genital mutilation"" - a view shared by a growing anti-circumcision movement.""If I were a female (in Western nations) this would have been illegal, the surgeon would be a criminal and this would never have been considered as an option by doctors,"" Alex wrote.""I do not believe in championing one gender over another but I feel strongly that gender equality should be achieved for all.""Campaigners for ""genital autonomy"" believe it is wrong to circumcise a baby or child - whether they are male or female - because the patient cannot give consent, and these campaigners regard circumcision as a human rights issue.Having lived with an intact penis for 21 years, Alex believed men circumcised as babies or young children would ""tragically never be able to fully comprehend what has been taken away"". He estimated he had been stripped of 75% of the sensitivity of his penis.However, experiences of men circumcised as adults differ dramatically.Some men actually prefer sex afterwards because they no longer have the pain of a tight or inflamed foreskin.Some report a significant loss in sensitivity and greatly reduced sexual pleasure.Some report being less sensitive but say there is no change in their overall enjoyment of sex.Some are very happy with their decision to get circumcised.Some, like Alex, deeply regret having it done.Alex sought further medical help following the circumcision as well as psychological help, but never shared his problems with his family or friends.""I was with him during those two years and I think I would be lying if I said I didn't think something wasn't right,"" says Lesley.READ""I did say 'Is something bothering you  Are you OK ' and he would absolutely reassure me that he was.""Lesley, who used to be a teacher, now hopes to go into schools and speak to young men about sharing their problems, even if they are very personal.""I think we all know that men don't particularly tend to talk about their problems in the same way that girls do but I think circumcision is very much a taboo subject,"" she says.""Alex was reserved. He certainly wouldn't have said 'I've got a tight foreskin and it really hurts'. And he didn't. And I didn't know.""Only a week after Alex died, a friend opened up to Lesley about his own circumcision.""He told me he wouldn't normally have mentioned it but he had a circumcision as an older man, 10 years ago, and he was in constant daily pain,"" says Lesley. ""It just seems it's more common than you think.""Mr Dorkin says serious problems following a circumcision are rare, but not unheard of.""You do hear of horror stories where a circumcision has been done poorly and there's damage done to the head of the penis itself,"" he says.Sometimes too much skin is taken and this can result in what's known as ""burying"" or shortening of the penis, where it gets pulled back into the body.""Surgeons at the end of the day are human and there is potential for human error and technical error during any operation,"" he says.A growing movement regards male circumcision as male genital mutilation""One of my mentors told me every case is a tricky case, that's got to be your approach to surgery. You never take anything for granted in surgery.""There have been cases of children and men dying after being circumcised.Four-week-old Goodluck Caubergs bled to death after a nurse circumcised him at his home in Manchester, while one-month-old Angelo Ofori-Mintah bled to death after being circumcised by a Jewish rabbi in London.Since 1995 at least 1,100 boys have died in South Africa after ritual circumcisions. Some penises fall off after becoming infected and rotten, while some have to be amputated.In Canada, where Alex was living, newborn baby Ryan Heydari bled to death after being circumcised by a doctor in Ontario.Recently there have been reports of two babies dying within weeks of each other after home circumcisions in Italy, and a two-year-old boy died after being circumcised at a migrant centre in Italy.""I'm not qualified to say that circumcision is always bad, because it isn't,"" says Lesley.""It certainly was in my son's case and I think we need more research. We need to look into the risks, what can really go wrong, and we need to be more aware of them.""If a circumcision is necessary, Mr Dorkin says it is important to tell patients about potential complications.""Particularly when you are doing the operation in a guy who is in his late teenage years or early adulthood, it's a very sensitive area and sexual function is important, so you have to explain the risks to them,"" he says.""Alex said he was not made aware of all the risks,"" says Lesley. ""If he had, I feel sure he would not have had the surgery.""Alex wasn't alone. I now know he wasn't the only one that this hasn't happened to. And that can't be right.""The UK charity 15 Square, which tries to educate people about circumcision, says Alex is not the only man to have killed himself after being circumcised.Consultant urological surgeon Trevor Dorkin, who is a member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, warns his patients of risks before circumcising them""It happens more frequently than people realise,"" says chairman David Smith.There are no statistics on men who have killed themselves after being circumcised. Alex died over a year ago but his story has not been told until now. An inquest into his death was held in the UK but it was not reported by the media.Lesley, who is normally private and reserved like her son, only agreed to share Alex's story because it was his dying wish.""If the following information can benefit anybody then it has served its purpose,"" he wrote.""I did not feel comfortable raising the issue when I had a choice, so if my story can raise awareness to break this taboo within society regarding men's health then I am happy for release of my words.""""Alex said in his letter 'We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us',"" says Lesley.""This is the last thing I'm doing for my precious son.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-Circumcision-caused-my-son-s-suicide-/688334-5075508-1015m7m/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post3.png
4,Suspect narrates Kyambogo bullion van robbery scheme - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. One of the suspects in the highly-publicised bullion van robbery, which occurred on March 6 at Kyambogo, has spoken out on how the plot was hatched and executed.The suspect, Mr Alfred Wabuyi, 53, a resident of Kireka narrated the sequence of events before the press on Monday night at the Internal Security Organisation (ISO) base in Nakasero, Kampala. Clad in a long-sleeved checked shirt and black trousers, Mr Wabuyi spoke with composure for at least 40 minutes with occasional licking of his lips. The father of six children was arrested a day after the foiled robbery.Mr Wabuyi revealed that he and his accomplices held at least two meetings around the city before the mission.A former car dealer on Luwum Street, Mr Wabuyi, said he had since ventured into trading in repairing and selling weighing scales. His confession made astonishing revelations.Three days before the mission, his friend asked him to find him in town for an  urgent meeting . Upon reaching the appointed venue, a friend of his, whom he only identified as Badru, asked him to help him do a simple assignment. I received his call while at my workplace in Mutungo and when I met him in town, I found him with three other men. When I asked him the details of the assignment, he [Badru] told me that it involved driving to Mukono to pick some stuff. Since he was my friend, I didn t hesitate to help him,  he said.The following day, they held a second meeting at a place from where they were to leave for Mukono. At ISO offices on Monday night, he only identified the people he was with as Bright, Eddy, Badru and another man whose name he could not readily remember.The arrangements madeHe said from that meeting, it was agreed that he and Badru would drive a Mark II while Bright, Eddy and two others, whose details he said he could not recall, would drive a Toyota Premio to Mukono. At this time, he was told that they were going for a very big deal in Mukono.He said the deal involved trailing a bullion van from Mukono to Kampala. Apparently, one of his colleagues, Eddy, was a brother of the bullion van driver, whom he later identified as Micheal Oketch. According to Mr Wabuyi s narrative, Mr Oketch had briefed his brother, Eddy, about the deal. Eddy later briefed Bright, Badru and the other colleagues.He would later learn that Bright was a former soldier under the Special Force Command (SFC).According to the plan, the Mark II manned by Bright, Eddy and some other guys was supposed to carry the money after the robbery.They set off from Kampala to Mukono and stationed around Stanbic Bank Mukono Branch, waiting for the bullion van to return from Kayunga, where it had gone to collect the money. Mr Wabuyi said when the van arrived from Kayunga and parked at Stanbic Bank Mukono Branch, the driver picked the drinks and bread which had been laced with sedatives from them.These eats, Mr Wabuyi said, were supposed to be given to the guards manning the bullion van. It is at this time that they started trailing the van. We could overtake them and wait for them because we were getting updates from the driver. We occasionally overtook the bullion van because it made several stopovers. When it stopped at Namanve Industrial Area, the driver stopped and called Eddy, who was in the Toyota Premio with the other men since it had also parked at Namanve to bring him the polythene bags we had bought before we left for Mukono. He trusted Eddy so much because they are brothers. He feared other guys to run away with the money. All this happened while we parked at a distance in our car. Unfortunately, the polythene bags ran out of space and we were told to look for other polythene bags around Namanve. They told us that we would find them on the way,  he recounted. But they told us that the pliers they had had failed to cut the seals on the boxes which contained money. The money, which was stashed in polythene bags was just on top of the boxes and that is why it was easy for our colleagues to pack it. The guards who were aboard the bullion van had lost consciousness and one of the other guys travelling in the Toyota Premio had entered the van. It is him and the driver that were communicating with us. By this time, Mr Wabuyi and his colleague Badru didn t know how much money had been stashed in the polythene bags. He said the driver preferred the other car to shuttle the money because his brother Eddy was in it.Throughout the journey, they maintained communication on phone. The next plan was how to break the seals that contained the other money and by the time they approached Kireka, darkness had started setting in. Unfortunately, their car, ran out of fuel. They called Bright who was in the other car several times to give them some money to fuel the car and also know how far they had gone but he wasn t picking his calls. They both contributed what they had and bought fuel. Since there was a lot of jam, we chose to drive through Kyambogo University so that we could connect through the other gate so that we could join them since they had told us that they could branch off from Jinja Road and head towards Kyambogo side. But shortly after exiting, we met a scuffle-like scene where two police officers stood by the roadside wielding guns. The bullion van and a Toyota Premio was also parked by the side. We drove off and I got out from around Nakawa while Badru remained with the car. I headed to my place in Mutungo,  Mr Wabuyi recollected.However, the following day, Mr Wabuyi says men dressed like civilians came to his workstation, asked him a few details before handcuffing him and taking him to ISO offices. For the last one month, he has been detained at ISO but says his family is aware. Asked why he and his colleague didn t stop after seeing a bullion van and a Toyota Premio which their colleagues travelled in parked by the side, he went mute.  He said he later learnt through the press that Bright and another man had been gunned down during a scuffle with security personnel at the scene while the rest fled.How security foiled robberyAn ISO official, who was privy to the operations that foiled the robbery but preferred anonymity, told journalists at ISO offices that they learnt of the deal from the very time it was being hatched.The officer said the late Bright Turyatunga, who was one of the architects of the deal, had confided in an officer in another security agency to join them but he rejected the risky deal. It is this officer that intimated to us and we started tracking them right from the first meeting. We kept monitoring their movements until we foiled the deal,  he said.The officer said the bullion driver and the other people involved in the mission are still on the run while two suspects are in custody. He dismissed Mr Wabuyi s claim that he wasn t at the scene. However, he suspected the entire deal was planned with the help of bank officials. Banks are supposed to have a tracking system to monitor movement of the bullion van.  Last month, ISO said the money in the van was Shs2.4b but noted that Shs617m had been stolen by the thugs.

7,Magistrate fired for poor judicial conduct - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. A Grade One Magistrate has been dismissed from the judicial service with immediate effect for being a habitual offender in corruption and abuse of judicial authority. Ms Grace Balintuma was dismissed following a resolution by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), a government body mandated to recruit and discipline judicial officers. The JSC made the resolution at a meeting on September 27, 2018 under minute 239/2018.At the time of her dismissal, Ms Balintuma was on interdiction with her last duty office being Kakiri court. The commission noted that you have been a habitual offender who has defied several warnings, written undertakings, severe reprimands and interdiction,  reads the dismissal letter to Ms Balintuma.The dismissalThe March 29 dismissal letter was authored by Dr Rose Nassali Lukwago, the permanent secretary of the JSC, and sent to the Judiciary. It is the determination of the commission that you are not a fit and proper person to continue serving in the Judiciary. The commission thus resolved that you be dismissed from the judicial service with immediate effect,  the letter further states. She had been charged with three counts under the JSC Regulation S1 87/2005. She was accused of acting in contravention of the Code of Judicial Conduct and abusing her judicial power. On the basis of the evidence adduced to the commission, her Worship Balintuma Grace, the Magistrate Grade One, was found to have committed the offences as set out in the respective counts,  the letter reads.Speaking to this newspaper yesterday, Dr Nassali said:  The JSC followed the due process following a series of complaints against her. She was invited and she interfaced with a disciplinary committee which later recommended to the full commission to deem it fit to dismiss her.  Dr Nassali stated that the commission is committed towards cleaning up the Judiciary.Last year in August, the Judiciary suspended the same magistrate, who at the time was attached to Kakiri court, over poor work. Her file was sent to the JSC for further investigations.In this complaint, it was alleged that while Ms Balintuma was hearing a land dispute in a criminal case in 2017; Uganda versus Ssajjabi Samuel and two others, she issued a civil order that reflected incompetence.The notice directed the accused to return to the disputed land, which order was illegal. The suspect in the case had been charged with conspiracy to commit a felony.Ms Balintuma came to the limelight in 2015 when she was charged with theft of pension money belonging to deceased soldiers. She was charged with two counts of theft and two counts of intermeddling in property of a deceased person contrary to the Administrator General s Act.She was at the time attached to Moroto Court. She was only let off the hook by Buganda Road Court after she returned Shs32m to the rightful family members of the deceased. ComplaintsThe commission also named eight of the previous complaints that had been brought.1. While working as Grade Two Magistrate at Njeru Court, Ms Balintuma released suspects on a capital charge on bail before the mandatory period had expired.2. She entertained and granted bail to accused persons in the absence of a prosecutor.3. She was found culpable when she acted on a file in a part heard case by a different magistrate.4. In 2007, she was reprimanded and given a warning by the then Chief Registrar over corruption.5. In 2007, she was severely reprimanded for handling matters beyond her jurisdiction.6. In 2008, she was found guilty of a prejudicial conduct, abuse of judicial authority and handling a matter beyond her jurisdiction. 7. She was tried by the internal disciplinary committee of the Judiciary for forcing herself on the premises of the Ministry of Justice and acting rudely, which was an irregular conduct for a judicial officer. 8. In 2015, she was charged for theft of Shs46m and intermeddling in an estate of a deceased person.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Magistrate-fired-poor-judicial-conduct/688334-5074974-bxdlqr/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post7.png
8,"My Easter concerts are on, says Bobi Wine - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, has said he will go ahead to hold his Easter music shows even if police have not responded to his notification he sent to them more than a month ago. Mr Kyagulanyi said he notified police in time to deny them the legroom to have excuses of not being notified as it has been the norm on several occasions when they blocked his shows. I hope the whole world is following. We notified police about six weeks ago and they are pretending to come out to say we did not write to them in time. We shall hold that concert with or without their reply,  he said. Police did not come clean on whether they had received Bobi s letter of notification or not as the deputy police spokesperson, Ms Polly Namaye, referred us to Kampala Metropolitan Police to comment on the matter.  This matter should be handled by the police spokesperson,  she said. Mr Patrick Onyango, the spokesperson for Kampala Metropolitan Region, said:  If they have referred you to us, let me check if there is a letter to that effect   According to schedule, Bobi Wine is expected to hold his concerts at One Love Beach in Busabala in Wakiso District on Easter Monday. He will then perform in Lira on May 3, Arua on May 4 and Gulu on May 5. Many times in the past, Police have banned or blocked Bobi Wine s concerts claiming he has not notified them in writing or had informed them late and they had not authorised the shows.Last year, police accused Bobi Wine of failing to notify them in time and closed his show on Boxing Day at the last minute. The same show had been previously blocked at Mandela National Stadium with claims the stadium had been earlier booked for a wedding function.In 2018, Bobi Wine s show that was meant to take place in Bukoto in Kampala was also blocked at the last moment. Meanwhile, yesterday, event organisers and promoters met President Museveni at State House in Entebbe to be compensated for the losses incurred in the previous events which were cancelled. The promoters had earlier appealed to President Museveni, who later promised them Shs1 billion but they have only received Shs200m. The lawAct. Section 5 of the Public Order Management Act says:  An organiser shall give notice in writing signed by the organiser or his or her agent to the authority officer of the intention to hold a public meeting, at least three days but not more than 15 days before the proposed date of the public meeting. It s reinforced by Section 6 which states:  Upon receipt of a notice under section 5, where it is not possible to hold the proposed public meeting for some reasons; the authority shall, in writing within 48 hours after receipt of the notification, notify the organiser or his or her agent that it is not possible to hold the proposed public meeting and the notice shall be delivered to the organiser s address as the notice of intention to hold a public address.

9,UNRA explains fresh repairs on new Nile Bridge - Daily Monitor,"Jinja. The Uganda National Roads Authority (Unra) has denied that more defects have developed on the Shs390b new Source of Nile Bridge in Jinja District and said the ongoing works are in respect of replacing the old temporary layer with a permanent one. The repairs on the bridge which have entered day three have prompted the authorities to divert Jinja-bound traffic to the old Nalubaale Bridge to allow maintenance works.The maintenance which kicked off on Monday is expected to take two months with Kampala bound traffic using the new Source of the Nile Bridge.The Unra public relations officer, Mr Mark Ssali, said yesterday that engineers are removing the old asphalt material which failed to be compatible with water proof materials. We are replacing the asphalts which failed and we started with the two lanes. We are going to wait for the waterproof materials to dry because we are replacing with new asphalts which are compatible with waterproof materials that had failed at first,  Mr Ssali said.He said the engineers promised to finish the work in about two months and the bridge will be ready for use by July 10. I want to assure the public that they should not be worried over the bridge. There is nothing such as cracks on the bridge as speculated, the structure is intact. It is just like removing an old carpet in your house and replacing it with a new one. That will cost no extra tax payer s money,   Mr Ssali said.The head of bridges and structures at Unra, Mr Lawrence Pario, recently said the last time they made repairs on the bridge, they only replaced the surface which was most affected, but this time, the contractor is removing the entire surface and putting something new. Structurally, there s no problem but we are simply replacing the entire road surface whose asphalt is rotting. Water proofing material and asphalt are flexible while concrete is rigid, so when you put a flexible material on a rigid material and there s no proper bonding, the flexible material moves,  he explained.According to contractors, they are replacing AC14 asphalt   which was not bonding well with water proofing material   with modified polymer asphalt.The new Nile Bridge was commissioned last October with a lifespan of 120 years. It was constructed by Zenitaka Corporation and Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company from Japan and South Korea.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UNRA-explains-fresh-repairs-new-Nile-Bridge/688334-5074986-f1qi6rz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post9.png
10,Masaka gangster was killed by colleagues - ISO - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. A counter-investigation launched by the Internal Security Organisation (ISO) has revealed that a nurse and a police officer (names withheld) whom President Museveni praised for aiding the elimination of machete-wielding gangsters in Masaka sub-region were allegedly working with the same criminals. Investigations revealed by ISO director general, Col Kaka Bagyenda, which are yet to be concluded, did not specify the role of the two but indicate that the nurse and police officer were behind the plot that led to the killing of one of the gangsters Muhammad Kiddawalime by the residents and co-accused Musa Galiwango to escape from custody. Col Kaka said apparently the police officer was boyfriend of the nurse and were both part of the network of the gangsters who had terrorised Masaka area, attacking and killing residents at night using machetes.  We are very close to finishing our investigations but the findings are pining these two people. The two knew each other and they were in an intimate relationship. We shall get to the bottom of this,  Col Bagyenda told Daily Monitor in an interview at his office in Kampala. On March 1 last year, Kiddawalime and Galiwango escaped from the Masaka Chief Magistrate s Court where they had been charged with murder in the machete attacks.The duo was waylaid by residents of Mukoko village in Bukullula Sub-county in Kalungu District, killing Kiddawalime as Galiwango escaped. It was reported that the duo had drilled a hole in the house of the nurse, now implicated, at around 3:49am. The nurse claimed the attackers had raided her in the night as she was sleeping. She raised an alarm, which attracted neighbours to come to her rescue. However, the ISO investigations revealed a contrasting account after the suspects had been smoked out of their hideout. InvestigationsInvestigations indicate that the police officer and his girlfriend first convinced Kiddawalime and Galiwango to escape when they were taken to court. ISO says the police officer and his girlfriend had calculated that Kiddawalime and Galiwango would be shot by the prison warders if they attempted to escape. This would kill evidence that linked the officer and his girlfriend in the gang s network. However, Kiddawalime and Galiwango successfully escaped from court in Masaka. ISO says the officer and his girlfriend now changed plan and opted for mob action as the alternative. On the fateful night, the police officer and his girlfriend lured the fugitive gangsters into the latter s house where she also operated a clinic. When Galiwango and Kiddawalime arrived in the house, the officer and his lover made an alarm, which attracted the residents. The angry mob captured Kiddawalime and killed him. Galiwango was lucky to escape. After the incidents in Kalungu, President Museveni called the nurse and the policeman to his home in Rwakitura to appreciate their  patriotism and job well done  President Museveni reportedly directed that the woman be immediately given a job in appreciation for being brave and calling the neighbours. He also reportedly appreciated the policeman for responding so fast to the incident. Later reports emerged that the woman had been employed in State House and the policeman reportedly recruited into the Special Forces Command, an elite presidential protection unit, on President Museveni s directives. We could not independently verify the reports.  All these revelations have been found in our ongoing interviews and we want to make sure these two people step aside from their current offices to make sure our investigations go on smoothly as planned,  Col Bagyenda said. Capt Denis Omara, the SFC spokesperson, said he could not find any officer in his records under the names of the said policeman.  I will continue searching in the archives but if he was here, I would have been able to see that already,  Capt Omara said. By press time, we were unable to get in touch with the policeman.

11,SGR needs Shs76b to pay project affected persons - Daily Monitor,"Kampala.  The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) project is in need of Shs76b to clear compensations for project-affected persons (PAPs) between Mayuge and Tororo districts, authorities have revealed.The SGR project coordinator, Mr Perez Wamburu, told the parliamentary Committee on Physical Infrastructure yesterday that the compensation for the land for PAPs already valued by the chief government valuer is Shs136.8b of which Shs60.8b has already been paid.  One of our challenges is the compensation for land for right of way for the SGR project. The money needed is supposed to clear the compensation for the PAPs between Iganga and Tororo because they have not yet been paid since the challenge has been budget,  Mr Wamburu said.Mr Wamburu was part of the team of technocrats who accompanied the State Minister for Transport, Mr Aggrey Bagiire, to present the Ministry of Works and Transport policy statement for Financial Year 2019/2020 before the committee chaired by Nakifuma County (NRM) MP Robert Ssekitoleko. The Committee heard that the entire SGR project compensation will cost Shs534.2b although the evaluation has so far covered Mayuge to Tororo only.In the coming financial year, the Works ministry requested for Shs39.6b to clear part of the outstanding compensation claims but the Finance ministry has only planned for Shs32b.  We are likely to see many PAPs taking the project to court because the money given to us will not be enough ,  Mr Wamburu said.Uganda is yet to embark on construction of the SGR from Kampala to Malaba Border Post. Despite the delays, the cost for the SGR has since been cut from Shs8.5 trillion ($2.3b) to Shs8.1 trillion (Shs2.17b).Minister Bagiire was, however, reluctant to adduce full information on the progress of the SGR but only said, the financiers of the project- the Exim Bank of China has put some conditions. The Exim Bank has insisted that they will not give us money if we have not got the entire right of way. We are seeking for support of all stakeholders to make sure we make SGR a reality,  he said.Daily Monitor has learnt that the Chinese gave a condition that Uganda and Kenya go together to borrow when the later seeks loan to finance the Kisumu-Malaba phase. This means, until Kenya is ready to negotiate for a loan to finance the Kisumu-Malaba phase, Uganda would not be allowed to sign for the Shs8.1 trillion. Mr Wamburu said what is happening at SGR now is the finalisation of the physical analysis of the project as required by Exim bank before the loan on the revised cost of the project is signed. He said Uganda needs to reach the SGR line at Malaba Border Post by October 2023, the same time Kenya will reach the same destination.Meanwhile, MPs tasked the Ministry to avail a budget for the purchase of road equipment for the districts and municipalities that have not yet received the road unit. This was after the engineer-in-chief, Mr Samson Bagonza, reported that districts which became operational in July 2018 are stuck over road maintenance. Buyamba County MP Amos Mandela asked the ministry to also recall all the old Chinese equipment grounded at different district headquarters and repair them so that they can be given to other districts.Briefing the same committee, Mr David Kakuba, the executive director of Civil Aviation Authority, decried the need for more land for future expansion of Entebbe International Airport.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/SGR-needs-Shs76b-pay-project-affected-persons/688334-5075046-qamt57z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post11.png
12,Are we sending pupils to boarding school too early  - Daily Monitor,"Gloria Namukisa sent her daughter to boarding school while she was in Primary Two. She says she was forced to make this decision by the challenges in commuting to school daily. But Namukisa also reveals, that is a decision she was later to regret.  I counselled her for several weeks before enrolling her; making her ready for the time I would not be around. I taught her how to wash her clothes, how to bathe, take care of her things, but also to psychologically prepare her to know that she will be responsible for most of her property. Most importantly I was encouraging her that everything would be fine,  she explains. However, things did not go as Namukisa expected.  Within two weeks, the other children had stolen her key, and swept her suitcase clean. The only thing she remained with were her bed sheets and blanket,  she recalls. But that was not all.  She came back a bit different. She would get nightmares and later told me that her fellow pupils told her that evil spirits come at night looking for children. She was also more selfish and did not want anyone to touch her belongings. This really got me rethinking my decision and what I needed to do,  she explains. Namukisa, a tailor, decided to move her tailoring shop to the neighbourhood she lived so that she could have her daughter in day school.Boarding schools are becoming more common than they were in the recent past. Originally the most common boarding schools were secondary ones. Today, almost every primary school has a boarding section and some schools have made it compulsory for some classes.  Growing up, my older siblings only joined boarding school in secondary school, and even then, my mother would remain worried that at Senior One they were still too young for boarding school. It was my father who always insisted on the move,  Faith Musinguzi, a parent, recalls.But thanks to the parents who have embraced boarding school in numbers, schools are admitting children from the age of five into the boarding sections. Seeing children aged as young as five standing next to mattresses and suitcases bigger than them on reporting day is now a common phenomenon. One wonders how a child who can barely do homework on their own will wash their clothes, take care of their possessions or themselves. Although nobody has earmarked the right age at which a child should join boarding school, the debate is; are we taking our children to boarding school too early  There are growing concerns that children are being sent to boarding school at a very young age and for some this has come with adverse effects on their lives. File photoBetter option Angella Ankunda, who took her now six-year-old daughter to boarding school when she was five, says in some cases, boarding school is a better option.  If you can leave a three-months-old baby with a house maid and go to work, it would be hypocritical to say that taking a five-year-old to boarding school is the worst thing one can do,  she asserts. She also argues that instead of leaving your child with a help who might expose them to some bad behaviour or abuse them, why not leave them at school where they will be in a more guided and controlled environment  Truth is, it is painful to part with your child at a very young age but circumstances often dictate to parents,  says Ankunda. But Matilda Namuyaba, a school matron at White Angels Primary School, Masajja, shares that although they try to give more attention to the younger pupils, they cannot provide all the care.  Since they are many, you cannot give all of them the maximum attention and care they deserve. So, some fall sick and you learn of it later when they are bedridden because they did not tell you or you were too preoccupied to observe. Some young ones even cry in the night when they want their parents, especially when they have just joined the school. Others are too stubborn to listen to you as the matron because they only listen to their parents,  she shares some of their challenges as caretakers. She further advises that a child should be sent to boarding school when they at least know the basics.  If a child is able to wash their clothes, bathe, fetch their own water, get their own meals and know when to eat, take care of their belongings and manage most of their affairs or relate easily with others, then these may find boarding school easier than those who cannot. Though we help them, we cannot do everything,  Namuyaba states. Psychological implications Lois Nakibuuka, a counselling psychologist, shares that parents or guardians are the first people who influence their child s life, view of the world and the people in it.  To be separated from them at a young age for boarding school gives them deep anxiety and bewilderment. This may even cause a child to wonder what they could possibly have done to deserve the punishment of being taken off to a strange environment and then try to cope on their own by non-social skills,  she notes. These may include; interacting and navigating the environment in an awkward, weird, or odd manner, antagonising others, teasing others frequently, being emotionally immature, among others. And other issues ranging from anxiety, low self-esteem. Emotional and mental scarring for life may also occur. The inability to sustain lasting emotional relationships may also be as a result of a child feeling unwanted. They may wonder that if they are not good enough for their parents to want them at home, how can they be good enough for anybody else to want them in their lives   Nakibuuka adds. She further advises that talking them through the reasons why you are taking them to boarding school way ahead of time will allow them to wrap their heads around the idea and get used to it.  Tell them about the situations that are leading them to this difficult solution. For example; if a child has to navigate a long route to school, ask them what danger they could encounter and how it can be solved. Point out the advantages of being in boarding school but also tell them what to expect realistically,  she says.The performance issue However, amid the debate on age and boarding school is the delusion; by teachers, school owners and parents that boarding school equals great academic results.  My son has always been an average student right from primary school though he was in boarding school. But when he joined secondary school; day section, the teachers started pestering me to bring him to boarding section. Every time they invited us for a parent s meeting to look at their assessment marks in the remedial examinations, the one and only solution that all teachers had to his poor results was enrolling him in the boarding section,  Geoffrey Kazibwe confesses. He recalls teachers advising that when he enrols his Senior Two son into boarding section, he will be surprised at how drastic his grades would improve.  They used this marketing language like they were more concerned about his grades than I was, that it made me think that probably, the teachers get a commission on every student who enrols in the boarding section!  Kazibwe asserts. Other alternativesRichard Muhumuza shares that there are some alternatives parents can consider.  For example, I still felt that my Senior One daughter was still too young for boarding school. What I did was to have her in a student hostel owned by her school (Mengo Secondary School). She stays at hostel during weekdays but comes back home for the weekend,  This way, he is able to strike a balance between her study time and time with her. There are some primary and secondary schools that offer weekly boarding to students such as Greenhill Academy and Rainbow International School. Alternatively, home-schooling may be the way to go for some parents. All the parent has to do is hire a qualified teacher to teach their child. This is not only convenient, but will also give the parents ample time with their child. However, Emmanuel Mugarura, the head of education at Kampala Smart School, an organisation that offers home-schooling services, says before parents choose to home-school their children, there are key aspects to note such as designing a personal learning plan and academic framework for the child.  This includes selecting a curriculum, instructional resources, learning applications and continuity plans,  he explains. Mugarura adds that a parent needs to also have the chance to provide weekly opportunities where the child meets with other children for interaction to boost their social skills. Some education experts argue that 10 should be the minimun age at which a child should join boarding school which is not the situation on ground. PHOTO BY ALEX ESAGALAExplore onlinePauline Mukisa, an online course moderator and digital enthusiast, shares that learning can now be online.  The only challenge so far is that local content may be limited, but a child can apply for an international curriculum in an international school and then study online. The thought may still be far from many people s minds but it could be something to look at, especially now that more people are embracing digitisation,  she says. For parents intent on keeping their children in a day school environment, a purely day school could be the solution for you.  The advantages of purely day schools is that the classes are timetabled in a way that will be convenient for all students. Classes start at 8am and end at 5pm to allow students time to move back home in time. It is usually candidate classes that have remedial classes that begin at 7am to 6pm. Additionally you will not get the school administration ordering you about a mandatory boarding section because they do not have the section in the first place,  Henry Bukembo, a teacher and parent, shares. Views on what should be the right time to take a child to school are divergent from one person to another. However, the International journal of Education and research on  The influence of boarding school to young children  (a case of Tanzania, 2016) refers to Ellen G. White s view that the suitable age for children to go to boarding school is that of 10 years. The journal also refers to the Kenyan parliament s decision in 2002 that the proper age for boarding school should be 12 years, when children are old enough.An illegal move Frances Atima, the assistant commissioner in the Directorate of Education Standards (DES), noted that boarding section arrangement is purely facilitated by parents and that government policy only emphasises access to quality education. He said this during the release of a DES report made after a survey on the standard of boarding schools in the country in November last year.The report also said 70 per cent of secondary schools are illegally operating boarding sections, having sought no permission from the relevant agencies. Atima explained that any institution which wants to have a boarding section must apply separately, be inspected and if they meet the minimum standards, be given authority to operate. Of the 800 secondary schools inspected, only 30 per cent of the schools complied with the required standards.  We already raised the red flag that many schools are operating boarding facilities without authority from the ministry. No school is registered as day and boarding other than the traditional schools, which were there in the early years,  Atima said.Is boarding school necessary Moses Kisekka, a teacher at St Kizito Primary School, shares that although boarding school has its own challenges to a child, it is necessary to impart some life skills. Though a child may be young, boarding school gives them more challenges to become responsible over their own property and life. For example, they may eat their edibles or waste their money the first time, and from that, they learn how to eat responsibly and use things sparingly, which is a skill everyone needs.He further emphasises that boarding school provides a good environment for a child to fully engage in education related activities with little distractions. Kisekka also notes the fact that boarding school can offer a better environment, especially for children who come from violent and abusive homes, who walk long distances to get to school among other circumstances.

13,"Landscaping, a new vocation course to try - Daily Monitor","Chrissy Ethel Namono, is a former accountant who loves beautiful spaces and was determined to turn that love into a job.  After working a few jobs as an accountant, I decided to quit for my passion,  the landscaper and founder Iconic Hedges, shares.  I did not grow up in a beautiful home, but when I travelled to other countries such as Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, among others, I appreciated how organised most of their homes and compounds were,  she states.In addition, every time she visited a home, she found herself rearranging it in her mind, and with time, she realised she could do more than just imagine. I only had Shs800,000 as starting capital which I used to buy a mowing machine. Clad in overalls, and a mowing machine in hand, I would move door to door looking for clients. Sometimes I would be mocked but I never gave up,  she recalls.As a landscaper, her first client was a home Namono had mowed earlier but found their compound out of shape.  I asked them whether I could put their compound back in shape. I rendered the service and the compound came out perfectly,  she exclaims.Lucrative jobIt is these that started recommending her services to other people leading to the birth of her own company - Iconic Hedges in 2016.To improve her skills, Namono had to pursue a Certificate in Landscaping with Design Concepts in Dubai, UAE. And in addition to this, she did an online design courses from Real Time Architecture.As more people appreciate beautiful homes, landscapes and gardening, in 2011, the Ministry of Education and Sports, under its Business Technical Vocational Education and Training programme rolled out an Assessment and Training Package for landscape gardeners (Level 1) for schools that train landscape gardeners. One such school is CIDI Training Centre for Gardening and Landscaping in Kampala. Edward Mutebi, 19, is a student pursuing a two-year Certificate in Landscape and Gardening at CIDI who joined the course after Senior Four.  It was difficult to choose what I would do but when I learned about gardening and landscaping, I thought that would work for me since I had studied Agriculture at O-Level and had passed it with a D2,  he shares. The first two weeks were challenging for Mutebi, especially having to learn botanical names of plants and flowers, but after counselling at the school, he was encouraged. We started going to the field and it became interesting. We would go to maintain compounds and plants, sometimes even setting a garden in place,  he recounts. Four weeks into the course, Mutebi started earning.  Recently I landscaped for a client in Bukasa, Muyenga. I designed the compound, mixed flowers and also did an accent plant for her. I earned more than Shs400,000 from this job,  he notes.About the course According to Rosemary Nampindi, a second-year student at CIDI, one of the course units is on landscape   which includes compound designing, drawing/ making compound plans, implementing a plan, maintenance of gardens. There is softscaping which deals mostly with plants and hardscaping that is composed of setting up areas, designs, platforms using constructive materials. We also study urban agriculture, which includes smart agriculture. Herbs production where we look at growing, producing and a bit of value addition of different medicinal plants and entrepreneurship, that is all about managing one s business,  she explains.Nampimbi has worked with three clients.  I worked on one compound, drew a plan for another and I have two clients I am going to draw plans for currently. Since I am just starting, I plan to sell my plans at about Shs500,000,  she says.Complementing each otherJucinta Kyobe, an animator, is surprised at how her skills in animation are gelling with with those in landscaping.  Even while doing animation, I used to do interior and exterior house designs so when I started studying landscaping, I got an idea of fusing the two because the software that we use in landscaping is like that used in animation,  she says.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Landscaping--a-new-vocation-course-try/688336-5071320-866takz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post13.png
14,"60% of cancers are infection-related, UCI officials warn - Daily Monitor","Doctors at Uganda Cancer Institute on Tuesday revealed that 60 percent of cancers are attributable to infectious pathogens. They also warned that cancers of cervix and other types caused by infectious agents present unique opportunities for prevention and treatment.Speaking at the cancer awareness dialogue at UCI, the head of comprehensive community cancer program, Dr Noleb Mugisha said Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (HPV Vaccine) prevents cancer of the cervix yet shunned by the public due to lack of sensitization. Once a girl child is vaccinated, the vaccine can protect 70 percent of those who were likely to suffer from this type of cancer  Dr.Mugisha said.Unfortunately, he said,  the program of vaccinating girls of the age of 10 years and above was launched about 10 years ago but the community have fully failed to embrace it. Dr Mugisha also revealed that for every 100 women and girls who suffer from cancer in Uganda, 80 of the cases are cervical cancer.Dr Mugisha also explained that  the reasons the vaccine up -take is low in Uganda is because many families are not aware that the vaccine exists; also the vaccination channel is not clear.  Other doctors observed that Human Papillomavirus Vaccine has remained low despite the government s efforts to save girls between the age of 10 years and above from contracting cancer of the cervix.The Vaccine is meant to protect girls and women against cancer of the cervix.The doctors explained the risk factors of cervical cancer is sexual contact, especially through unprotected sex with many partners yet 60 per cent of the cancers in Uganda are infection related. Dr Mugisha said cervical cancer is by far the most common HPV-related disease with nearly all cases of cervical cancer attributable to HPV infection.Dr Mugisha also pointed out that worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women, representing 7.5 per cent of all female cancer deaths.Pointing out cervical cancer as one of the leading causes cancers and causes of death among women world over, UCI officials asked the government encourage parents not to miss out on having their children especially girls immunized. Nearly half a million people surfer from cancer of the cervix and 300 000 women of die from cancer of the cervix every year. A senior official in the ministry of health also reiterated that, for every 100 women that suffer from cancer in Uganda, 80 of those suffer from cancer of the cervix.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/60--cancers-are-infection-related-UCI-officials-warn/688334-5075130-j2eu3a/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post14.png
15,"New limbs, new life for South Sudan amputees - Daily Monitor","Stephen, 12, romps confidently around the sunlit courtyard, weaving in between wheelchair-bound patients as he plays with the other children, his prosthetic leg barely a hindrance.When he was five years old, the car he and his family were travelling in hit a landmine in South Sudan's northern town of Bentiu. His grandmother was killed. His left leg was shattered and had to be amputated.Stephen was flown to a physical rehabilitation centre run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Juba, which serves both as a prosthetics factory and a hospital for patients coming from all around the country to be fitted with new limbs.""It helped me to go to school,"" Stephen says shyly, pointing to his artificial leg.After receiving his first prosthesis in 2013, war prevented Stephen from being able to return for new fittings every six months as recommended. When he finally made it to the centre this month, his prosthesis was far too short.South Sudan's five-year-long civil war has left possibly tens of thousands of people without limbs -- a toll that may never be accurately established.Approximately 60 percent of the patients who come to the Juba centre -- one of three in the country -- have gunshot-related injuries and disabilities, according to the ICRC.But much of the country faces limited access to healthcare, a result of fighting or simply a lack of infrastructure, with roads typically being utterly impassable during the rainy season. Many limbs are amputed for no other reason than lack of treatment.""A simple injury or fracture that could be treated easily in most countries... can result in infections here which result in an amputation because of problems with healthcare,"" said ICRC prosthetic specialist Regis Tiffeneau.""The large majority of patients are affected by the war in one way or the other.""Others became disabled by polio, rickets -- linked to malnutrition -- or other diseases that have been eliminated in so many other parts of the world.Lack of accessIn the factory, plaster is slapped on models of legs whirring on machines as workers shape them and then slather them in dark brown plastic.Workshop manager Emmanuel Loubari said that the prosthesis can be made within a day of a patient being measured and a cast taken. Last year the centre made 580 prosthetic limbs, with the cost of all treatment borne by the ICRC.But many challenges face patients who need to get fittings.""We have a lot of patients who are supposed to be fitted, but they cannot have access to the centre,"" Loubari said.In South Sudan, roads are so bad that the ICRC relies on a fleet of planes and helicopters to bring patients to hospitals and the physical rehabilitation centres.In the rainy season, it can be hard to land in many remote locations.Bringing people from across the country, injured in fighting mostly of an ethnic nature, brings its own problems.""They come here, they are traumatised, most of them are injured by gunshots and mines,"" said social worker James Soma. ""We talk to them about forgiveness.""He said an argument had broken out the previous day in which one patient accused another of targeting her because of her tribe, and said she would ""bring one of my relatives and shoot you all.""Toddlers shot on mothers' backsFor those who have used a prosthesis before, like Stephen, it takes only two or three days before they are ready to go home. But for new patients it can take a few weeks.Other patients at the centre currently include a young man with severe scoliosis -- a curved spine -- who was being taken to school in a wheelbarrow until he was brought in to get a customised wheelchair.Another was bitten by a snake and was not treated for almost two weeks, so his leg had to be amputated.""We have a lot of children coming in,"" said physiotherapist Oketta Robert Kanyara. ""We have five children in the centre, shot in different styles... We have children shot while tied to their mothers' backs.""Five-year-old Laytol was probably bitten by a snake. Her mother comes from the Murle people, and the doctors have difficulty understanding the language. But they believe her leg ""could probably have been saved"" if she had got help in time.Laytol is trying out her new leg for the first time, balancing herself calmly between two metal bars.Kanyara, the physiotherapist, said training children requires using games, as they do not understand the idea of shifting their weight and struggle to follow instructions.But progress can be made. When the physiotherapist started work with Stephen, the boy who lost his leg in a landmine in 2013, the challenges were many.""It was very, very difficult,"" Kanyara said. ""You tell him to do weight bearing, but he starts crying, so you have to go slowly.""Little Laytol took to her new leg more quickly.""She is very good,"" Kanyara said. ""She is fitted today, and she is not crying. She is walking.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/New-limbs-new-life-South-Sudan-amputees/688340-5074470-6qk10n/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post15.png
16,Sudan's Bashir transferred to prison in Khartoum - Daily Monitor,"Sudan's military rulers have transferred ousted president Omar al-Bashir to prison, a family source said Wednesday, as demonstrators keep up their sit-in outside the army complex calling for a swift transfer to civilian government.Following the dramatic end to Bashir's rule of three decades last week, he was moved late Tuesday ""to Kober prison in Khartoum"", the source said without revealing his name for security reasons.Witnesses near the prison in north Khartoum said there was a heavy deployment of soldiers and members of a paramilitary group outside.The 75-year-old's whereabouts have been unknown since a military takeover on Thursday, when the country's new rulers said he was being held ""in a secure place"".The detention of Bashir has failed to pacify protesters, who launched anti-government demonstrations in December and have for days been camped out in front of Khartoum's army headquarters.Sudan's military rulers have made some concessions to protesters, including the sacking Tuesday of prosecutor general Omer Ahmed Mohamed, but demonstrators fear their uprising could be hijacked.""We faced tear gas, many of us were jailed. We have been shot and many have died. All this because we said what we wanted to,"" protester Fadia Khalaf said.Officials say at least 65 people have been killed in protest-related violence since December, with some of those killed immortalised in a Khartoum mural.While there have been scenes of celebration -- with demonstrators singing and waving their national flag -- the protest site has grown more tense amid concerns the army will try to clear the sit-in with force.""Now we fear that our revolution could be stolen, which is why we are keeping our ground here. We are staying here until our demands are met,"" said Khalaf.Earlier this week witnesses said several army vehicles had surrounded the area and that troops were removing the barricades which demonstrators had put up as a security measure. AU warns military rulers On taking power on Thursday the army said a military council would run the country for two years, sparking an immediate backlash from protest leaders who have issued a series of demands.Just a day later former defence minister General Awad Ibn Ouf stepped down as council chief, sparking jubilation on the streets of Khartoum.His successor General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan oversaw weekend talks with political parties, which failed to make headway.Sudan's foreign minister has said Burhan is ""committed to having a complete civilian government"" and has called on other nations to back the council.The military rulers dispatched an envoy to the African Union's headquarters in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, but the regional bloc threatened to suspend Sudan over the coup.The 55-member union has given the military council just 15 days to hand over to civilian rule, while the United Nations has appointed a new envoy to work with the AU on mediating an end to the crisis.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have thrown their support behind the military, whose troops are set to remain in an alliance led by the Gulf powerhouses in Yemen.Western powers which previously called on Bashir to heed protesters' demands have continued to back the demonstrators, pushing for a civilian administration in talks with military rulers.READ:Uganda willing to give Bashir asylum- government",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Sudan-s-Bashir-transferred-prison/688334-5075648-31dw3e/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post16.png
17,Government inaugurates new UIA board today - Daily Monitor,"Kampala- Privatization and Investment Minister Evelyn Anite is today expected to inaugurate the new board of Uganda Investment Authority with a call to speed up job creation in the country. The Minister of state for Investment and Privatization will [today] officially inaugurate the new Uganda Investment Authority Board (UIA),  the Media Centre alert reads in part. The inauguration of a new board chaired by Mr Emely Kugonza who was also the chair of the disbanded board comes after Finance Matia Kasaija, in a February 6 letter, copied to Ms Anite said effective April 1 the entire board would be terminated. The new board members were given on a three-year contract in spite of the fact that UIA was named among several government agencies to be scrapped and merged with others. The proposed merger seeks to ensure efficacy and reduce on wasteful expenditures.Other board members are Mr. Fred Opolot, Mr Morrison Rwakakamba, Mr Joshua Mutambi, Mr Godfrey Byamukama Kerere, Ms Ombombasa Naima and Ms Getrude Kutesa Lutaaya.When contacted, Ms Anite confirmed the inauguration of UIA board and explained that the Investment Code Act 2019 reduced the membership of UIA board from 13 to seven in order to ensure efficiency and cut costs.  This is Kisanja Hakuna Mchezo, as government, we have carefully selected these people because we want results. Ugandans want serious investors who will create jobs and pay taxes ... we don t want brief case investors,  Ms Anite told this website on Wednesday.The precious board was dissolved after the President signed the law on February 20. The new UIA board members were cleared by Cabinet last month following weeks of consultations and background checks.The Investment Code Act 2019 seeks to cut red tape, speed up job creation and investment promotion in the country. The new law provides a mechanism of dealing with local and foreign investments in Uganda and promises favourable conditions for investment and other related matters.In his 2016 job creation plan, Mr Museveni sought to create at least 1,000,000 jobs before the end of his tenure in 2021. However, it s not clear how many jobs the government has created since 2016.Role of UIAUganda Investment Authority (UIA) is a semi-autonomous government agency which drives national economic growth and development in partnership with the private sector. As an Investment Promotion Agency, UIA mainly: markets investment opportunities; promotes packaged investment projects; ensures local and foreign investors have access to information, especially about the business environment so as to make more informed business decisions; and offers business support, advisory and advocacy services.NEW UIA BOARDBoard Chairman1.

18,'Circumcision caused my son s suicide' - Daily Monitor,"Lesley Roberts was stunned as she read the devastating final email from her beloved son Alex Hardy.The email had been timed to arrive on 25 November 2017, 12 hours after he killed himself. Less than an hour before the email arrived, Lesley had opened her front door to find a police officer standing there, explaining her son was dead.Alex was an intelligent and popular 23-year-old with no history of mental illness. Lesley could not understand why he would have wanted to take his own life.His email explained how the foreskin of his penis had been surgically removed two years before. This is commonly known as circumcision, but Alex had come to believe it should be regarded as ""male genital mutilation"".He never mentioned this to his family or friends when he was alive. Lesley did not even know her son had been circumcised.In the following months, she tried to find out more about circumcision. Why had it affected Alex so badly, and why did he feel killing himself was his only option Alex was the eldest of Lesley's three sons and had been very much longed for, having been conceived after fertility treatment.Lesley says her ""dreams came true"" when she became a mother in July 1994.""He was everything I could have wished for,"" she says. ""Gorgeous, easygoing, and adoring of his younger brother Thomas who arrived following more treatment almost three years later.""He also adored his baby brother James, who was born when Alex was 13. The walls and windowsills of Lesley's home in Cheshire are covered in photos of all of them.Alex sailed through his education and was particularly gifted at English, so much so that his old school established the Alex Hardy Creative Writing Award in his memory.""Alex was passionate about history but as his English teacher I saw in him a true talent for writing,"" says Jason Lowe, who is now head teacher at Tarporley High School.It was while on a school skiing trip to Canada, aged 14, that Alex fell in love with the country. He had enjoyed skiing as a child and the trip reignited his passion. So, when Alex reached 18, he decided to defer university and live in Canada for a year.""He fell in love completely with Canada and made so many friends and got a promotion at work,"" says Lesley.""After one year he rang me and said 'Mum, I'm deferring my place for university'. The same thing happened after year two.""Two years turned into three, then four, and by the time of his death Alex had been living in Canada for five years and had obtained residency.""He was known as the 'super-smart Brit' with impeccable manners,"" says his mother. ""The super-intelligent guy from the UK who helped people with their Canadian residency applications.""Lesley visited her son several times, both alone and with his brothers and stepfather. They were a close family, but Alex did not tell any of them he was secretly suffering with a problem with his penis.""I had issues with a tight foreskin,"" he eventually wrote in his final email, ""but from my late teens it created issues in the bedroom as it meant my foreskin would not retract over the glans as intended which caused some awkward moments.""The foreskin protects the head of the penis, known as the glans. Getty ImagesIn 2015, still silently suffering, Alex consulted a doctor in Canada. He was given steroid cream to stretch his foreskin, but went back to the doctor after just a few weeks because he did not think the treatment was working.The medical name for Alex's problem is phimosis. It simply means his foreskin was too tight to pull back from the head of his penis, or the ""glans"" as Alex referred to it in his email. This is perfectly normal for boys in the early years of their life. As boys get older, their foreskin usually starts to separate from the head of the penis.Phimosis does not always cause problems, but if it does, problems can include difficulty urinating and pain during sex. In England, the NHS advises topical steroids and stretching techniques - and circumcision as a last resort.Over in Canada, where circumcision is more common, Alex was referred to a urologist.""He immediately suggested circumcision,"" Alex wrote. ""I asked about stretching and he completely lied to my face and said it would not work for me.""I was mostly trusting as I felt he was the expert who knew best in this regard so with a pinch of salt I accepted it.""Lesley has since read online reviews of this urologist which have made her question his competence. One patient said she had been unable to work since having surgery for kidney problems, and he had ""destroyed"" her quality of life.""I'm a mother of three young children who are scared every day I will die as they see me suffering in so much pain,"" she wrote.""I can see how he misdiagnosed others, botched surgeries, and ruined lives,"" said another review. ""He's dangerously incompetent.""Another review of Alex's urologist read: ""They left a surgical instrument in my bladder but I only got notified three months later. Run away before you get hurt!""Lesley, who was ""horrified"" by these reviews, has asked for the urologist to be investigated. She has been told an inquiry is ongoing.READ:The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia told the BBC it ""cannot disclose the existence of a complaint against a physician, and only may do so if the complaint leads to formal discipline"".""I will wish with my last breath and with all of heart that my darling son had run away,"" says Lesley.Much to his regret, Alex was not able to research the urologist - or circumcision - properly at the time because his laptop was broken.He had tried researching the topic in a public computer space but felt uncomfortable, and also felt it was ""too much of a taboo"" to discuss with friends.So Alex booked what he believed was a minor procedure and had the surgery in 2015, at the age of 21.""It quickly became apparent that what had just happened was a catastrophe,"" Alex wrote in the email to his mother.He attached a much longer public statement in which he explained, in great detail, the physical problems he had suffered after being circumcised.He described experiencing constant stimulation from the head of his penis, which was no longer protected by his foreskin.""These ever-present stimulated sensations from clothing friction are torture within themselves; they have not subsided/normalised from years of exposure,"" he wrote.""Imagine what would happen to an eyeball if the eyelid was amputated """"He was in so much pain that it hurt to do normal physical activity,"" says Lesley. ""He was a keen skier and snowboarder so you can imagine the pain he was in.""Consultant urological surgeon Trevor Dorkin, who is a member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, advises his patients that the head of their penis will be more sensitive after circumcision.However, this sensitivity usually reduces.""I always say to guys 'it's going to feel more sensitive to start with' because all of a sudden you haven't got this protection over the head of the penis and it will feel different,"" says Mr Dorkin, who has carried out more than 1,000 circumcisions.""But in the vast majority of the cases the man adjusts to that, the brain adjusts to that, it adjusts to the signals that are coming back through the nerves from the head of the penis.""Alex also wrote about experiencing erectile dysfunction, and burning and itching sensations, particularly from a scar which sat where his frenulum was removed. The frenulum is a band of tissue where the foreskin attaches to the under surface of the penis. Some men refer to it as their ""banjo string"".""It's one of the more erogenous zones so it's thought to be important in sexual function,"" says Mr Dorkin.""The foreskin, the head of the penis and the frenulum is a very, very sensitive area.""But again when you do circumcision sometimes the frenulum is not preserved and it doesn't necessarily have an effect on overall sexual function and enjoyment.""But Alex felt his frenulum had been important.""Through its absence I can certainly verify it is the most erogenously sensitive area of the penis and male body overall,"" he wrote.""If someone were to amputate your clitoris you may begin to be able to understand how this feels.""He wrote about experiencing cramps and contractions in his muscles and ""uncomfortable"" sensations which extended deep into his abdomen.Lesley does not know whether or not Alex had sex after his circumcision.""Where I once had a sexual organ I have now been left with a numb, botched stick,"" he wrote. ""My sexuality has been left in tatters.""RelatedHe asked: ""Nature knows best - how can chopping off a section of healthy tissue improve nature's evolved design ""Like many people, Lesley admits she knew very little about the foreskin or circumcision before her son died.""I didn't know anything apart from I believed it was a very routine surgery,"" she says.The foreskin is sometimes dismissed as a ""useless flap of skin"", but Mr Dorkin says it does have a purpose.""It covers the head of the penis,"" he says. ""In terms of what's it for, it provides a bit of protection to the head of the penis. It's thought to have some sort of immunological function perhaps.""Circumcision rates vary a lot depending on where you are in the world and which culture you grew up in.According to the World Health Organization, 95% of men are circumcised in Nigeria but only 8.5% of men in the UK are.Most of the men circumcised in the UK are either Muslim or Jewish, as circumcision is regarded as an important part of their religions.According to the 2011 census, Muslims accounted for 4.8% of the population in England and Wales, while 0.5% were Jewish.People who question circumcision are sometimes accused of being anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, but Lesley stresses her son was neither.""For me, this has nothing to do with religion at all. I respect all people of faith or indeed no faith, as Alex did,"" she says.In Canada, where Alex had moved to, an estimated 32% of men are circumcised.Alex felt male circumcision has been normalised to the extent that most people do not question it, while female circumcision has become known as female genital mutilation (FGM) and is now illegal in many countries.He felt male circumcision should be known as ""male genital mutilation"" - a view shared by a growing anti-circumcision movement.""If I were a female (in Western nations) this would have been illegal, the surgeon would be a criminal and this would never have been considered as an option by doctors,"" Alex wrote.""I do not believe in championing one gender over another but I feel strongly that gender equality should be achieved for all.""Campaigners for ""genital autonomy"" believe it is wrong to circumcise a baby or child - whether they are male or female - because the patient cannot give consent, and these campaigners regard circumcision as a human rights issue.Having lived with an intact penis for 21 years, Alex believed men circumcised as babies or young children would ""tragically never be able to fully comprehend what has been taken away"". He estimated he had been stripped of 75% of the sensitivity of his penis.However, experiences of men circumcised as adults differ dramatically.Some men actually prefer sex afterwards because they no longer have the pain of a tight or inflamed foreskin.Some report a significant loss in sensitivity and greatly reduced sexual pleasure.Some report being less sensitive but say there is no change in their overall enjoyment of sex.Some are very happy with their decision to get circumcised.Some, like Alex, deeply regret having it done.Alex sought further medical help following the circumcision as well as psychological help, but never shared his problems with his family or friends.""I was with him during those two years and I think I would be lying if I said I didn't think something wasn't right,"" says Lesley.READ""I did say 'Is something bothering you  Are you OK ' and he would absolutely reassure me that he was.""Lesley, who used to be a teacher, now hopes to go into schools and speak to young men about sharing their problems, even if they are very personal.""I think we all know that men don't particularly tend to talk about their problems in the same way that girls do but I think circumcision is very much a taboo subject,"" she says.""Alex was reserved. He certainly wouldn't have said 'I've got a tight foreskin and it really hurts'. And he didn't. And I didn't know.""Only a week after Alex died, a friend opened up to Lesley about his own circumcision.""He told me he wouldn't normally have mentioned it but he had a circumcision as an older man, 10 years ago, and he was in constant daily pain,"" says Lesley. ""It just seems it's more common than you think.""Mr Dorkin says serious problems following a circumcision are rare, but not unheard of.""You do hear of horror stories where a circumcision has been done poorly and there's damage done to the head of the penis itself,"" he says.Sometimes too much skin is taken and this can result in what's known as ""burying"" or shortening of the penis, where it gets pulled back into the body.""Surgeons at the end of the day are human and there is potential for human error and technical error during any operation,"" he says.A growing movement regards male circumcision as male genital mutilation""One of my mentors told me every case is a tricky case, that's got to be your approach to surgery. You never take anything for granted in surgery.""There have been cases of children and men dying after being circumcised.Four-week-old Goodluck Caubergs bled to death after a nurse circumcised him at his home in Manchester, while one-month-old Angelo Ofori-Mintah bled to death after being circumcised by a Jewish rabbi in London.Since 1995 at least 1,100 boys have died in South Africa after ritual circumcisions. Some penises fall off after becoming infected and rotten, while some have to be amputated.In Canada, where Alex was living, newborn baby Ryan Heydari bled to death after being circumcised by a doctor in Ontario.Recently there have been reports of two babies dying within weeks of each other after home circumcisions in Italy, and a two-year-old boy died after being circumcised at a migrant centre in Italy.""I'm not qualified to say that circumcision is always bad, because it isn't,"" says Lesley.""It certainly was in my son's case and I think we need more research. We need to look into the risks, what can really go wrong, and we need to be more aware of them.""If a circumcision is necessary, Mr Dorkin says it is important to tell patients about potential complications.""Particularly when you are doing the operation in a guy who is in his late teenage years or early adulthood, it's a very sensitive area and sexual function is important, so you have to explain the risks to them,"" he says.""Alex said he was not made aware of all the risks,"" says Lesley. ""If he had, I feel sure he would not have had the surgery.""Alex wasn't alone. I now know he wasn't the only one that this hasn't happened to. And that can't be right.""The UK charity 15 Square, which tries to educate people about circumcision, says Alex is not the only man to have killed himself after being circumcised.Consultant urological surgeon Trevor Dorkin, who is a member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, warns his patients of risks before circumcising them""It happens more frequently than people realise,"" says chairman David Smith.There are no statistics on men who have killed themselves after being circumcised. Alex died over a year ago but his story has not been told until now. An inquest into his death was held in the UK but it was not reported by the media.Lesley, who is normally private and reserved like her son, only agreed to share Alex's story because it was his dying wish.""If the following information can benefit anybody then it has served its purpose,"" he wrote.""I did not feel comfortable raising the issue when I had a choice, so if my story can raise awareness to break this taboo within society regarding men's health then I am happy for release of my words.""""Alex said in his letter 'We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us',"" says Lesley.""This is the last thing I'm doing for my precious son.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-Circumcision-caused-my-son-s-suicide-/688334-5075508-1015m7m/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post18.png
19,Jailed MP aspirant rushed to Mulago hospital amid torture claims - Daily Monitor,"LIRA. The former Ajuri County MP contestant, Mr Isaac Apenyo has been rushed to Mulago National Referral Hospital amid claims of torture during the time of his arrest.The Uganda Prison Service Public relations officer, Mr Frank Baine told Daily Monitor on Tuesday that Mr Apenyo was referred to Mulago hospital by Lira Regional Referral Hospital where he had been getting treatment.  It is true he claims to have been beaten by the time he was being arrested. The [court] sitting in Lira ordered that he should be taken to hospital for examination and Lira Regional Referral Hospital referred him to Mulago,  he said.Mr Baine further noted that the officer in charge of Lira Government Prison has written to Lira High Court in Lira District to decide on Apenyo s fate since he is a civil prisoner.READ:Former MP aspirant sent to jail over Shs84m election debtAjuri County MP Mr Hamson Obua.

20,"60% of cancers are infection-related, UCI officials warn - Daily Monitor","Doctors at Uganda Cancer Institute on Tuesday revealed that 60 percent of cancers are attributable to infectious pathogens. They also warned that cancers of cervix and other types caused by infectious agents present unique opportunities for prevention and treatment.Speaking at the cancer awareness dialogue at UCI, the head of comprehensive community cancer program, Dr Noleb Mugisha said Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (HPV Vaccine) prevents cancer of the cervix yet shunned by the public due to lack of sensitization. Once a girl child is vaccinated, the vaccine can protect 70 percent of those who were likely to suffer from this type of cancer  Dr.Mugisha said.Unfortunately, he said,  the program of vaccinating girls of the age of 10 years and above was launched about 10 years ago but the community have fully failed to embrace it. Dr Mugisha also revealed that for every 100 women and girls who suffer from cancer in Uganda, 80 of the cases are cervical cancer.Dr Mugisha also explained that  the reasons the vaccine up -take is low in Uganda is because many families are not aware that the vaccine exists; also the vaccination channel is not clear.  Other doctors observed that Human Papillomavirus Vaccine has remained low despite the government s efforts to save girls between the age of 10 years and above from contracting cancer of the cervix.The Vaccine is meant to protect girls and women against cancer of the cervix.The doctors explained the risk factors of cervical cancer is sexual contact, especially through unprotected sex with many partners yet 60 per cent of the cancers in Uganda are infection related. Dr Mugisha said cervical cancer is by far the most common HPV-related disease with nearly all cases of cervical cancer attributable to HPV infection.Dr Mugisha also pointed out that worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer in women, representing 7.5 per cent of all female cancer deaths.Pointing out cervical cancer as one of the leading causes cancers and causes of death among women world over, UCI officials asked the government encourage parents not to miss out on having their children especially girls immunized. Nearly half a million people surfer from cancer of the cervix and 300 000 women of die from cancer of the cervix every year. A senior official in the ministry of health also reiterated that, for every 100 women that suffer from cancer in Uganda, 80 of those suffer from cancer of the cervix.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/60--cancers-are-infection-related-UCI-officials-warn/688334-5075130-j2eu3a/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post20.png
21,Mityana hospital authorities accused of mismanagement - Daily Monitor,"Mityana. Councillors in Mityana District have accused Mityana General Hospital administrators of concealing information about lack of essential equipment at the facility.The councillors say the hospital has been operating without an X-ray machine for more than six months and patients are currently referred to Mubende Hospital located about 100 kilometres away, for X-ray services. The hospital administration has not officially brought it to our attention that the X-ray machine is not functioning. We got the information from patients,  Ms Helen Namugosa, a district councillor representing Kalangalo Sub-county, said at the weekend.Last July, a number of computers, microscopes and a CD4 machine reportedly went missing from the hospital.Ms Namugosa, who also chairs the committee on education and health, said they are not yet convinced that the medical equipment was stolen from the hospital without knowledge of the staff since the hospital management reportedly failed to show proof that the facility was broken into by intruders.Mr Joseph Luzige, the Mityana District Council chairperson, said the hospital administration has chosen to work in isolation, something that has affected service delivery at the facility. For reason only known to them, the hospital administrators have chosen to work in isolation. They have failed to give us regular reports about inoperative medical equipment yet we have a budget of Shs130m every year specifically for the hospital,  he said.He added the district council recently passed a resolution compelling the hospital administration to charge only Shs25,000 from patients admitted to the private ward, but they continue to get reports that some unscrupulous medical staff still charge between Shs50,000 and Shs100,000, which is exorbitant.Mr Paul Kabenge, the Mityana General Hospital senior administrator, admitted that the X-ray machine is not functioning, but said plans are under way to repair it.  We are yet to fix that problem and I want to assure our people that the X-ray machine will soon be functional,  Mr Kabenge said.He refuted reports that staff at the hospital engage in extortion. Some politicians have on several occasions made such wild allegations, but they are unfounded. No one has come out with evidence against any staff here,  he added.The hospitalThe hospital receives between 300 and 450 patients daily, including from other districts such as Kassanda, Kiboga, Gomba and some parts of Wakiso and Mubende.

22,"Alupe, the Busia village with two chairpersons - Daily Monitor","BUSIA. As residents of Alupe Village in Buteba Sub-county, Busia District, joined the rest of the country on July 10 last year to vote in the Local Council elections, they expected to choose one chairperson.However, following the disputed election results, residents now have two village chairpersons, one serving the southern part and another the northern.  That election left deep wounds, which have never healed,  Mr George Onyango, a resident, says. As a result, we have two village chairpersons. It is now up to individuals to decide between the two whom to invite to preside over their functions and to report their cases,  he adds.Mr Sam Sihaire Murenga and Mr Philip Ekisa each claim to have won the village seat and have return forms from the Electoral Commission (EC) to prove it.One of election return forms signed by Mr Frederick Baraza, who was the presiding officer, indicates that Mr Murenga won the polls by one vote after polling 204 votes against his rival s 203 votes.However, another election return form signed by Mr Andrew Ekodit, who was the polling assistant, declared Mr Ekisa winner with 224 votes against Mr Murenga s 204 votes.Mr Murenga, who had been the incumbent, leads the southern part while his counterpart leads the north.They each have the mandate and official rubber-stamps. They carry out their duties as stipulated in the Constitution such as presiding over cases and other functions in their respective areas of operations. Mr Ekisa told Daily Monitor that he conducts all activities on behalf of government because he is the elected chairperson.  If you want to know that I won the polls, move around and ask my people. That is the reason why majority of them come to me for my stamp and other things. They trust me,  he says. He, however, accuses Mr Baraza of trying to sell his victory. Mr Baraza denies the allegations. Mr Murenga also maintains that he won the polls but his opponent refused to accept defeat. He connived with the polling assistant and the sub-county elections officer, Mr Anthony Akure, to rob me of my victory,  he says.It is alleged that Mr Akure organised a fresh election on July 12, where he declared Mr Ekisa winner. However, Mr Akure denies the allegations, saying he was not in the district on the said day. Efforts by the district chairperson, Mr Geoffrey Wandera, and the deputy Resident District Commissioner, Mr Paul Kalikwani, to mediate between the duo have been futile.Mr Wandera says there is increasing insecurity in the area as a result of warring parties. There is conflict and violence between the supporters of each of chairperson. This is not good,  he says. Residents fear to associate with either of the chairpersons because they risk being attacked.Mr John Okello, a resident, appealed to government to intervene and restore peace.  There is eminent escalation of the situation if the authorities do not address the crisis,  he says.Mr Robert Oguttu, another resident, says the two are fighting because the village has a lot of resources and land. A small plot of land goes for not less than Shs10 million and the presence of gold in the village, which has attracted several mining companies, is making the job of the chairperson very important,  he says. Gold mining is one of the major economic activities in the village.Residents also accuse Mr Stephen Okunyuku, the sub-county chairperson, of recognising Mr Ekisa as the elected chairperson. However, Mr Okunyuku denies the claim and urges the two parties to dialogue. Mr Patrick Luke, the officer-in-charge of Busia Police Station, says they have registered several cases of violence and assault from the village since the disputed elections. We are concerned, but we do not have powers as police to decide who is the chairperson of Alupe,  Mr Luke says. Ec perspectiveAn August 28, 2018, letter signed by Mr Sam Rwakoojo, the Electoral Commission secretary, disregarded the election results for Alupe that were signed by Mr Ekodit who declared Mr Ekisa winner.  As the Electoral Commission, the person deployed as presiding officer in Alupe Village is Frederick Baraza and not Andrew Ekodit. Therefore, the person declared by Frederick Baraza is the elected chairperson,  the letter reads in part. Mr Joseph Omona, the district returning officer, says Mr Murenga is the village chairperson.  He won and was declared the winner after he defeated his rival by one vote but his opponent has refused to accept defeat,  he said.

23,Shortage of teachers crippling education in Ntoroko District - Daily Monitor,"Ntoroko. Many government-aided schools in Ntoroko District are facing acute shortage of teachers, a challenge that is affecting learners  performance, authorities have revealed. The Ntoroko senior education officer, Ms Moreen Kusemererwa, on Monday observed that due to the shortage in staffing, many schools have in the last three years failed to complete the syllabus.Ms Kusemererwa said the problem is exacerbated by the district s failure to replace teachers that have passed on, those that retired and some that abandoned the profession in search of greener pastures.Statistics from the district education department indicate that the district has a staff ceiling of 108 secondary school teachers but only 52 are available leaving a deficit of 58. For primary schools, the staff ceiling is 335 but 300 are available, leaving a deficit of 35 teachers.The senior education officer blames the failure to recruit teachers on the shoestring budget from the central government. The teacher-pupil ratio is beyond the government policy of one teacher to 53 pupils and this is affecting students  performance in class,  Ms Kusemererwa told Daily Monitor in an interview on Monday.Last year, Mr Simon Bimbona, the Ntoroko chief administrative officer, wrote to the Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Education and Sports, about the teacher gap in the district. Mr Bimbona indicated that the district required Shs64m and Shs214m to recruit primary school and for secondary school teachers, respectively.The district chairperson, Mr Timothy Kyamanywa, said for the last three years, they have been able to recruit only 29 teachers who have not received salary since their appointment.  As a district administration, we have written several letters to Ministry of Education and they are telling us that there is no money for recruitment. We have a functional district service commission which cannot recruit any civil servant because there is no wage bill,  Mr Kyamanywa said.The director of education standards at Ministry of Education, Dr Kedres Turyagyenda,expressed his displeasure at some districts that return wage bills to the treasury after failure by the district service commission to recruit civil servants.Others say...The deputy head teacher of Karugutu Secondary School, Mr Isaac Kandole, said they have only five teachers, including the head teacher who are enroled on the payroll. He said the rest are working on part time basis and the school has to look for extra resources to meet their pay.  We want government to send us more teachers who are on payroll to improve on teaching,  Kandole said[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Shortage-teachers-crippling-education-Ntoroko-District/688334-5074820-p4pqv7/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post23.png
24,Apaa land crisis: Committee asks government to stop evictions - Daily Monitor,"AMURU/ADJUMANI. A six-member parliamentary committee, tasked to investigate the Apaa land conflict, has asked government to stop any form of eviction of locals settled on the disputed land until true land ownership is established.The legislators were selected on March 3 this year by Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga.They made the call on Monday while meeting a section of Apaa locals and their leaders at Amuru District headquarters.Apaa land, measuring approximately 827 Sq Km, borders Amuru and Adjumani districts. Government claims it is a protected East Madi Wildlife Reserve gazetted by Parliament in 2002.Their call follows government s recent directive of stopping business people from operating in Apaa Market citing it is in a protected area.The market was shifted to Zoka Centre in Zoka Parish, about 10 kilometres inside Adjumani District, sparking off outrage.In an April 10 letter written by the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) warden-in-charge of East Madi Wildlife Reserve, Mr Tony Olinga Bogere, the traders were ordered to conduct their last businesses last Friday.ComplaintsMs Agnes Ameede, the Butebo District Woman legislator, who is also the committee chairperson, told Daily Monitor in an interview on Monday that the recent directive waters down their work given the fact that they have been selected to investigate and inform government. It would have been prudent for government to wait for the outcome of our investigation. This issue was also handled in the 9th Parliament; reason why they didn t come out with a conclusive report was because the matter was taken to court. It is still due for hearing,  Ms Ameede said.She said if government had been operating under coordination of all interest, the recent directives of eviction would not have been implemented. It s not right and we as a committee since we have heard it from the locals as part of our finding, we shall write to the speaker to pray that government respects our work and possibly stop the eviction until our report is out,  she said.During the one-day meeting, the affected Apaa locals raised concern on the credibility of the committee citing that earlier the President had called for formation of committees from both Acholi and Amuru but their recommendations were never used.The locals also reiterated their rejection of government plans to relocate and compensate them and instead demanded degazettement of the land under contention.However, Ms Ameede said their committee is independent and promised that their reports will be based on facts.She also said they have been able to interact with various stakeholders, including the Tourism minister, Prime Minister, Internal Affairs minister, Lands minister, Acholi Parliamentary Group, Madi Parliamentary Group, and civil society.The Amuru Resident District Commissioner, Ms Agnes Linda Auma, said the eviction is denting government image.She blamed government for the recent clandestine registration of the locals in Apaa, arguing that the figures did not represent the true numbers of people.Documents presented before Cabinet in February seen by this newspaper titled:  The memorandum of efforts to resolve the Apaa land conflict,  indicated that a total of 374 households occupy the land out of which 206 of them were found to be cooperative with government.Ms Auma said the incorrect figures come as a result of people shying away from the exercise, adding that it is the same reason they rejected the proposed plans to resettle and compensate them. In my opinion, government should carry out fresh registration of the locals in the area and find out the exact number of the people and the bona fide land owners, this will enable a long lasting solution,  she said.She also blamed UWA officials for blocking consignments of medicine to be taken to Apaa Health Centre II, arguing that the locals in the area have to now move long distances for medical treatment.Other committee members are Mukono South MP Johnson Muyanja Ssenyonga, Kyaka South MP Jackson Kafuuzi Karugaba, Worker s MP Margaret Rwabushaija and Makindye-Ssabagabo Municipality MP Emmanuel Ssempala Kigo. The team is expected to visit the disputed Apaa land today.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Apaa-land-crisis-Committee-asks-government-stop-evictions/688334-5074842-9dlg9l/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post24.png
25,MPs task leaders to explain poor renovations at hospital - Daily Monitor,"NTUNGAMO. The Committee on Government Assurance and Implementation has expressed dissatisfaction with the renovation of facilities at Itojo Hospital in Ntungamo District and called for investigations into the procurement process.The renovation started in January 2016 and ended in December 2017. The works were aimed at upgrading sewerage system, general, male and paediatric wards and roofing, among other sections of the hospital.The renovation cost Shs700 million.However, during the visit to the hospital on Monday, MPs said the value of work done was below the money spent. Mr Patrick Kasumba, the MP for Bujenje County, tasked the leaders to explain.  We want to know how the hospital was renovated, the whole procurement process, the contractor, who awarded the contract and how it ended up like this.  The floor has remained the same, doors do not shut and the toilets do not work. The chief administrative officer, the district engineer and the contracts committee must explain,  he said after the visit to the hospital.Kumi Municipality MP Silas Aogon, the committee leader, said the works were incomplete or poorly done. He said they are interested in knowing how the certificates of compliance and completion were issued, and why the contractor was paid all the money.He asked the Chief Administrative Officer to write a report to the committee in a few days  time. The Apac District Woman MP, Mr Betty Engola, said the district leaders must take issue of accountability serious. Itojo Sub-county councillor Denis Muhumuza, who is also a member of the hospital management committee, noted that the contract was awarded from the ministry. He added:  We also want to know why we were never given money for the third phase because other hospitals had three phases (of works). It may be because we stopped the first contractor.  The hospital medical superintendent, Dr Oliver Asiimwe, said the poorly done renovation is part of the reason the hospital toilets, sewerage lines and water system keep breaking down.She also said the hospital has an outstanding electricity bill of Shs210 million and their annual budget is only Shs192 million. The Deputy Resident District Commissioner, Mr Isaiah Kanyamahane, asked the parliamentary committees to always go to local governments and check on accountability issues.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/MPs-task-leaders-to-explain-poor-renovations-at-hospital/688334-5074858-ionp1tz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post25.png

28,Cleric condemns arbitrary arrests - Daily Monitor,"KANUNGU/KASESE- The head of Kihihi Archdeaconry, the Rev Can Justus Tibesigwa, has criticised security agencies for the arbitrary arrests in the ongoing hunt for criminals who abducted a US tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott and Ugandan guide Jean Paul Mirenge.The two were kidnapped from Queen Elizabeth National Park Ishasha Sector on April 2 by four armed men and released on April 7 after paying a ransom of $30,000 (about (Shs110 million). The money was allegedly taken to the neigbouring DR Congo where they were being held.Locals say about 30 people have since been arrested from Kanungu District, mainly in Kihihi Town Council, which has created fear in the community. Addressing the congregation during the Palm Sunday prayers, Rev Tibesigwa, who is also the former Kinkizi Diocesan Secretary, said even those who merely speak about the abduction are picked up. Some people are being arrested in bad faith, we need prayers on how police and security agencies are conducting the operation. Some people have been arrested because they have been  negligent  in their ways,  Rev Tibesigwa said.He urged locals to be smart and careful in what they do to avoid trouble in the ongoing investigations. The Deputy Resident District Commissioner, Mr Emmy Ngabirano, on Monday said out of 21 people being held at police, 10 have been freed and 11 retained. The District Police Commander, Mr Julius Turyagumanawe, declined to comment on the matter and referred our reporter to the police spokesperson for Kigezi Region Elly Maate, who also referred the matter to the police headquarters. Police spokesperson Fred Enanga did not answer our repeated calls. US President Donald Trump has urged Ugandan government to arrest and prosecute the kidnappers.Meanwhile, Uganda Wild Life Authority (UWA) last week tightened security at the national park.Two new ranger posts have so far been opened in the middle of the park and more forces deployed to ensure security.  We (government), have decided to establish many ranger posts all over the park in order to seal off all security gaps.

The deputy Japanese ambassador to Uganda, Mr Mizimoto Horri, who founded the construction of Lions Bay ranger post, challenged UWA officials to utilise the facility to achieve the intended purpose. The UWA executive director, Mr Sam Mwandah, noted that efforts to secure Queen Elizabeth National Park were being limited by the 11 fishing villages inside the area and the three main highways that run through it.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Cleric-condemns-arbitrary-DR-Congo-Kanungu-Palm-Sunday/688334-5073140-mxk0pgz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post28.png
29,Farmers express mixed views on Museveni s rejection of Sugar Bill - Daily Monitor,"Jinja- President Museveni s recent refusal to assent to the Sugar Bill has drawn mixed reactions from sugarcane farmers and manufacturers in Busoga Sub-region.Addressing the NRM Parliamentary Caucus retreat at the National Leadership Institute in Kyankwanzi District last month, Mr Museveni said he refused to sign the Sugar Bill into law in order to protect the sugar industry. The way you are behaving, you are antagonising our old sugar people and I don t know the relationship you have with small sugar people,  the President said.But speaking at the weekend, the spokesperson of Busoga Sugarcane Out growers Association (BSGA), Mr Godfrey Naitema, expressed displeasure with the President s decision, arguing that Uganda is a liberalised economy where all investors are free to compete. Mr Museveni wants to favour only big investors yet he previously said he wants Uganda to be an industrialised country. We shall not accept monopoly in the country because we are already a liberalised economy,  he said.Mr Naitema said the current factories in Busoga, including Old Kakira Sugar Works Limited, cannot consume all the available sugarcane due to low demand from millers. President Museveni s refusal to assent to the Bill means farmers from Busoga will be the most affected because sugarcane farming is their main source of income. We have educated our children up to university using proceeds from sugarcane; so, limiting the number of sugar companies in an area will reduce on the market for our sugarcanes,  he said.According to Mr Naitema, if Parliament reinstates Clause 22 of the Sugar Bill [zoning], it will give old sugar companies a chance to reduce on the sugarcane prices because competition for raw materials will be eliminated.Key amendments in the Bill include deleting Clause 22, which had provided that the Sugar Board would not license more than one miller in an area within a radius of 25 kilometres from another.It also includes a new formula for paying sugarcane out growers, notably that the minimum prices will be a product of the weight in tonnes of the cane and the amount of sugar to be squeezed out of every 100 tonnes times 50 per cent.The 50 per cent is to compensate the out growers for the additional derivatives that millers extract from sugar such as molasses, ethanol and bagasse for power generation.The chairperson of Uganda Sugar Manufacturers Association (USMA), Mr Jim Kabeho, said the absence of a zoning policy compels millers to fight for sugarcane, which has killed the sugar industry. Since 2005 when these small factories started mushrooming, production has been going down yet ordinarily, it would have been going up because of the many factories,  Mr Kabeho said.  Uganda had a capacity of producing 600,000 metric tonnes of sugar every year but we are now producing only 400,000 tonnes because there are no enough raw materials for all the existing plants,  he said.The manager in-charge of large taxpayers at URA, Mr Simon Ngabirano, while in Kakira last week, said MPs rushed to pass the Sugar bill without understanding its implication.He said this has led to the Bill s misinterpretation. We can see the level of interests about the sugar Bill I think President s actions at the moment gives us chance to have another look, there is an opportunity to give the MPs time to re-table it because scarcity of materials and competition is not healthy in the Sugar sector,  Mr Ngabirano said. He was speaking during a function to recognise Kakira Sugar Works Ltd for its Shs254b contribution in taxes.About sugarcane sectorFarmers- BSGA records indicate that Busoga sub-region has 20,000 large scale sugarcane farmers and five sugar factories of Kakira Sugar Works in Jinja, Mayuge Sugar Factory, GM Sugar Factory in Njeru Town Council, Buikwe District, Kamuli Sugar Limited and Kaliro Sugar Limited.Likelihood. If Parliament amends the Bill, sources say all small sugar mills near established sugar factories will be compensated and given a five-year tax holiday until they break even. On March 1, Mr Museveni wrote to the Speaker of Parliament, Ms Rebecca Kadaga, rejecting the Bill.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Farmers-Museveni-Sugar-Bill-Busoga-NRM-Kakira/688334-5073146-15ft8yfz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post29.png

Staff started removing furniture from the buildings last Thursday following a reminder from Namulondo Investments Limited, an investment arm of the kingdom.In a March 22 letter addressed to the district, the kingdom accused the leaders of deliberately failing to formalise their tenancy. You stated that some officials promised to give a response to your claim of being bonafide/lawful occupants on the kingdom s land, but they did not revert to you. Our client does not have any record of any meeting with your office where such issues were discussed and resolved neither did you furnish us with the same,  Mr Magellan Kazibwe, a lawyer of Namulondo Investments Ltd, states in the letter.He said they will seek legal redress if district authorities fail to organise a meeting with kingdom officials in two weeks. The office blocks have been housing the office of the chief administration officer, health and education departments.Mr Jude Mbabaali, the district chairperson, said he relocated the affected departments to Kijjabwemi Rehabilitation Centre premises, about 2km away.  In the meantime, let us minimise the pressure put on us by Buganda, it is better we vacate as we find a solution of paying their money,  he said.Mr Mbabaali said they have written to central government requesting for funds to build their own headquarters, adding that they are yet to receive a response.Eviction noticeMr Musa Matovu Kigongo, the Buddu County spokesperson, said they have launched a campaign to evict districts in Buganda that are not paying the nominal ground rent. Months ago, authorities in Kalungu District were also given a 30-day ultimatum to vacate the kingdom buildings after failing to pay the rent amounting to Shs281.2m.

The residents under their umbrella association Bubulo Environmental Conservation and Management Association  (BECOMAP) have for the past three years been engaging in conservation activities to restore the degraded ecosystem in the landslide prone districts of Manafwa and neighbouring Namisindwa by planting trees on the hills that have been left bare due to massive deforestation. They have also planted bamboo trees and elephant grass on the banks of River Manafwa. Mr Musa Mandu, the chairperson of the association, said:  We realised nothing will work best to prevent such disasters in this region better than embracing conservation through community- based approaches. He said they are also operating nursery beds and practising fish farming and bee keeping as source of their income. Mr Mandu said they have also trained locals in several sub-counties in districts of Manafwa and Namisindwa to engage in good farming practices such as contour ploughing and digging terraces on hilly areas.He said this has improved livehoods, boosted catchment and reduced soil erosion, adding that they have plans to extend their project to Bududa by end of this year.  Mr Mandu said in the past, whenever it rained, River Manafwa would cause havoc and wash away their crops, livestock, bridges and houses.  We decided to plant different types of trees with strong roots along the river to curb flooding, which had become a menace in this area,  he said. Ms Susan Nakhayali, a member of the association, said previously, in Namutebi, the land was bare especially on the steep slopes but now it is being restored. The association, which has more than 150 members, was formed to promote environment conservation as solution to disasters. It has its headquarters in Namutebi Town Council in Manafwa District.The Mt Elgon area has registered spates of deadly landslides last year only between May and October more than 67 landslides were recorded.Mr Micheal Milisho, a member, said although they are doing voluntary work, they are happy that they are helping to save humanity from disasters.  We are working closely with district leadership to promote the conservation to mitigate the disasters and prevent the loss of lives of our people. That is our hope, which keeps us moving,  he says, adding that government and non-government organisations should supply them with more tree seedlings. In Bubuyela Village in Buyinza Town Council, residents have adopted the method of making terraces using rocks to control speed. The State minister for Environment, Ms Mary Gorreti Kitutu, said:  This is a true spirit of trying to address ecosystem degradation, which is a major drive of disasters such as landsides in Bugisu region.  The permanent secretary in the Ministry of Water and Environment, Mr Alfred Okidi Okot, said during the retreat for senior management of his ministry in Mbale Town at the weekend, that the government is willing and committed to supporting residents who have embraced environmental smart solutions to fight climate change. The deputy head of civil service, Ms Deborah Katuramu, said it is good that residents have started owning up responsibilities but urged the civil servants to play their part in service delivery. LandslidesLast year only between May and October more than 67 landslides were recorded at Mt Elgon area.However, in most of the landslides, there was no human deaths recorded apart from the Bukalasi mudslide in Bududa District, which left more than 50 people dead after River Tsume burst its banks due to heavy rain.In March 2010, more than 150 people were killed and 10,000 displaced in Nametsi, Bududa District by landslides.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Locals-adopt-tree-planting-fight-disasters/688334-5071498-lo8wvd/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post31.png
32,Gulu university returning officer detained - Daily Monitor,"Police are holding Gulu University returning officer Edmond Okello over allegations of interfering with the guild presidential elections.Okello was picked on Saturday evening shortly after announcing Mr Johnson Nowe as the winner of the hotly contested guild elections held on Saturday.Mr Nowe, a third year student of Medicine and Surgery garnered 1,403 votes, according to the results read by Mr Okello.Nowe defeated his close rival Samuel Oyet Agwani, a second year student pursuing Bachelor of Arts in Education who got 750 votes. He will now replace outgoing guild president Daniel Mbazira.Other candidatesImuran Ntambazi Java, who identified himself with People Power movement got 398 votes, Mr Alexander Okidi, a second year student pursuing Bachelor of Development Studies, garnered 158 votes while Moses Etyak, a second year student of Bachelor of Computer Science who came last with only 79 votes.However after the results were announced, some of the contestants and their supporters accused Mr Okello of helping Nowe to rig elections.They also complained that the number of ballot papers printed were less than the required numbers which made many students to miss voting.Mr Okello was later whisked away by police after the students tried to beat him up.The Aswa River Region Police Spokesperson Jimmy Patrick Okema told Daily Monitor that Okello is detained at Gulu central police station to prevent students from attacking him.""We carried out a preventive arrest because he was under threat from angry students. We shall free him when the situation is calm,"" Mr Okema said.The Spokesperson Gulu University electoral commission, Mr Emmanuel Ochan admitted that the ballot papers printed were less and blamed Okello for the mistakes.He noted that they had expected 5,000 ballot papers but only 3,000 were printed adding that by 4pm, voting had already stopped despite many students who had not yet cast their votes.A total of 4,700 students registered to vote for the guild elections.""Many students especially in the faculty of Humanity missed out because the ballot papers were over. The decision to print the ballot papers was solely in the hands of the returning officer and we wonder why he printed less,"" Mr Ochan said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Gulu-university-returning-officer-detained/688334-5071868-s97vag/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post32.png
33,Kabaka rallies schools on holistic education - Daily Monitor,"Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II has lauded schools championing holistic education programmes, saying it gives children hope for a brighter future.While addressing subjects during his 64th birthday celebrations at Ndejje Secondary School in Luweero District at the weekend, the Kabaka said every school should strive to achieve holistic education. All schools offering holistic education and upholding standards are giving us hope of a good future for the young generation. We thank Ndejje SS and all the other schools for the great work. We thank God for giving us life and we pray that God gives us the strength to serve our country in a better way,  the Kabaka said.Besides academics, holistic education entails co-curricular activities such as sports and music.Earlier, he toured different projects at Ndejje SS where he commissioned the administration block and planted a tree in commemoration of his birthday.He also gave accolades to five people in recognition for their contribution in developing the kingdom. These included businessman Gordon Wavamunno, Mr Magid Bagalaaliwo, musician Mesach Ssemakula, Mr IK Kabanda and Mr Abdul Kaaga.Mr Charles Peter Mayiga, the Katikkiro, said the celebrations come at a time when Buganda has registered progress in many areas which he attributed to team work. Buganda is on the right track in areas of development which is not only reflected in projects, but the health of its people. Many people look worried about the future of their country where the youth believe the time is now to engage in leadership which is healthy,  he said. Mr Mayiga warned residents of Bulemezi County against relying on handouts, but establish small enterprises to fight household poverty. This mentality [of surviving on handouts] is not good. Time for lamenting about the liberation war is not now because you have the capacity to live a better life,  he said.The Katikkiro also urged parents to ensure that their school-going children wear shoes. This is for the health of our children because many children still walk bare footed as they move to school. This should not happen in Buganda,  Mr Mayiga said.Bishop Elidard Nsubuga of Luweero Diocese urged parents and communities not to abandon the responsibility of grooming children into future responsible citizens. The good morals cannot be instilled by teachers at the day care centres. This should be a collective responsibility. We have parents who do not want to contribute to children s welfare, including their lunch. This is very bad and should stop because only healthy children will have the opportunity to concentrate,  he said.BACKGROUNDThe birthday celebrations began with Kabaka Birthday Run in Kampala and other towns and diaspora on April 7. Kabaka Mutebi was born on April 13, 1955, to Kabaka Edward Fredrick Muteesa II and Nabakyala Sarah Nalule at Mulago hospital and spent his early years in Mengo palace. He was later taken to the UK in 1967 when President Milton Obote abolished kingdoms.

34,"Mob lynches man for killing wife, son - Daily Monitor","KAKUMIRO. Grief and shock on Friday gripped residents of Kyakachwende Village, Katatemwa Parish in Kakindo Sub-county, Kakumiro District, after a 25-year-old man allegedly killed his wife and his one-year-old step son.Joseph Kukundakwe, a causal labourer, allegedly slit the throats of Rosett Tumuhirwe, 37, and Brian Ampumpaire with a machete and closed them inside the house. The duo had been married for 45 days.The District Police Commander, Mr Najib Waiswa, said the suspect, after committing the crime, went into hiding but residents mounted a search, found him and beat him up before police intervened.He was taken to Kakindo Health Centre IV where he was pronounced dead shortly after.Adrine Kirabo, 14, a daughter of Tumuhirwe, said she went to check on her mother on Saturday only to be repelled by a foul smell at the door of the house.On entering, she found the mutilated bodies of her mother and brother. I immediately called my grandmother who made an alarm that attracted residents,  Kirabo narrated.Police appealPolice conducted a postmortem before handing over the bodies of the deceased to relatives for burial. Mr Waiswa condemned the act and urged residents to always use local leaders in resolving domestic misunderstandings. People should not use violence to solve conflicts. People can use their neighbours, local leaders or even go to church rather than killing somebody,  he said.The sub-county chairperson, Mr Micheal Yombo, who had employed the two, said the man wrote a will before attempting to commit suicide. The man, after killing his wife and child, attempted to take poison. He also wrote his will, detailing why he had killed his step son and wife,  Mr Yombo said. The village chairperson, Mr Emmanuel Serunjogi, revealed that he had on several occasions received complaints of misunderstandings from the couple.Recent incident Rising cases. Five children of a businessman at Kahompo Village, Bufunjo Sub-county in Kyenjojo District were on March 13 hacked to death by unidentified assailants. The deceased were all children of Joseph Tumwebaze, a businessman and resident of Kahompo village. Police say the assailants hacked all the children to death, beat up the wife before they carried and dumped her in River Kahompo from where she was later rescued by the residents. According to detectives, Tumwebaze had travelled to Kasese District at the time his home was attacked. Police later arrested five people in connection with the murder. Investigations later pointed to a family wrangle that dates back in 2012.

35,Nodding syndrome parasite discovered - Daily Monitor,"A lead researcher into the mysterious Nodding Syndrome at the Ministry of Health has defined Onchocerca Volvulus (OV) as a parasite responsible for the cause of nodding in children where several lives in Acholi Sub-region have been lost.The nodding syndrome is a mysterious illness that affects the brain and central nervous system of children, primarily between the ages of five and 15.The children nod off their heads coupled with seizures and in most cases they lose the contact of the surrounding environment.The disease causes increased diminishment in mental capacity and over the course of time, many children develop severe growth retardation. A child who is 12 or 13 will appear to be six or eight years old.While presenting his research report before stakeholders in Gulu Town on Friday, Dr Richard Idro said his team was able to identify OV, a parasite vectored by black fly as the responsible parasite behind the nodding syndrome.The research that kicked off in 2015 in the northern region where nodding syndrome is reported relied on data provided by global positioning systems to come to a conclusion. We found that the nodding syndrome is associated with Onchocerciasis, which is transmitted by Onchocerca Volvulus found in black flies. This was after we tagged and mapped all the victims  GPS coordinates which indicated victims  concentration (population) on River Aswa which is an infection of the black fly,  Dr Idro said.The research, which was conducted in laboratories across the six districts of Lamwo, Kitgum, Pader, Lira, Omoro and Gulu, discovered fragments of proteins of OV peptides in the cerebrospinal fluids drawn from the victims.In his report, Dr Idro stated that more than 95 per cent of the specimen (participants) with nodding syndrome examined preliminarily showed higher levels of OV antibodies than in epileptic cases.He stated that their conclusion on black fly factor, a vector of Onchocerca Volvulus Microfilaria, discovered as being the cause of the infection was derived from results of larviciding and aerial spraying done in communities around River Aswa. Following mapping, larviciding and spraying by government to eradicate black fly in 2013, Uganda has not had any new case of nodding disease, this means that the black fly itself has been a big factor in the infection although the mechanism is yet to be established,  he said.The proportion of nodding syndrome patients testing positive for OV has since dropped from 15 in 2013 to four in 2017, when government embarked on massive vector control of black flies, the report stated.Tested samples from hair, blood, urine, soil, water and animals from this infected area did not reveal any toxins, thus nullifying the assumption that the disease could have been a result of chemical weapons due to the long war in the sub-region between Lord Resistance Army and UPDF or poisoned food distributed by humanitarian bodies during the insurgency.The report indicates that the brain damages in victims is permanent and requires medication for life.  Even if we got the drugs that cure the syndrome, the brains of the already affected children will never be healed, because the infection damaged the brain,   he said.It was also revealed that the brains of victims with severe conditions became smaller (generalised) cerebral atrophy [thinning] and degenerated like in the elderly with tau-Protein deposits [taupathy]. Last year, a team of researchers led by Dr Richard Echodu of Gulu University, in their six years  research failed to link the infection to mycotoxins in contaminated foods when they discovered no supporting evidence for the association between the two.The researchers were assessing whether the consumption of fungal mycotoxins contributes to nodding syndrome development after a WHO International meeting in Kampala in 2012 recommended that fungal contamination of foods should be investigated as a possible cause of the disease. More than 3,000 children in Acholi are grappling with the disease and more than 500 have so far died.Previous reportIn September 2018, a group of six scientists led by Ontario-based Prof Michael Pollanen and Uganda s consultant pathologist, Dr Sylvester Onzivua, released a report linking the disease to taupathy, referring to a degenerative disease linked to deposition of insoluble proteins in the brain.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Nodding-syndrome-parasite-discovered/688334-5071698-11cyrog/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post35.png
36,Government shifts Apaa Market amid protest from traders - Daily Monitor,"AMURU/ADJUMANI. Government has ordered businessmen and residents to stop operating in Apaa Market, one of the markets sitting on the disputed Apaa land bordering Amuru and Adjumani districts.The market brings together hundreds of traders from both Amuru and Adjumani who deal mainly in agricultural products. It was previously in Pabbo Sub-county, Amuru District, before government forcefully demarcated it in October 2017 and handed it to Adjumani District local government.In an April 10 letter written by the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) officer-in-charge of East Madi Wildlife Reserve, Mr Tony Olinga Bogere, traders were ordered to conduct their last business in the market on April 12 (Friday).He also noted that the market has since been shifted to Zoka Centre in Zoka Parish, Itirikwa Sub-county, about 10 kilometres inside Adjumani, arguing that the previous space is within a protected area.The move follows a directive from the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) dated March 28 that directed the Ministry of Local Government and the Adjumani District local government to urgently close Apaa Market, describing it as  illegal .The latest directive by government, however, sparked outrage among locals and district officials.The Adjumani District chairperson, Mr James Leku, said the decision has long been in the interest of the district since it s in a protected area.But his counterpart in Amuru District, Mr Michael Lakony, says the directive was undertaken by the OPM and the President without consulting the team they constituted to negotiate over the land. In February this year, cabinet resolved that the locals who are victims of the Apaa land conflict be resettled with building materials and money after assessing damages.A memorandum of understanding seen by Daily Monitor indicates that the victims are to be given a package of Shs10 million, 20 iron sheets, 20 bags of cements, and Shs2 million for those who cannot identify themselves or without National IDs.The process of relocation and compensation is supposed to be spearheaded by Office of the Prime Minister, Lands Ministry and the Northern Uganda State Minister, Ms Grace Kwiyucwiny.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-shifts-Apaa-Market-amid-protest-from-traders/688334-5071706-cnvc1f/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post36.png
37,"New limbs, new life for South Sudan amputees - Daily Monitor","Stephen, 12, romps confidently around the sunlit courtyard, weaving in between wheelchair-bound patients as he plays with the other children, his prosthetic leg barely a hindrance.When he was five years old, the car he and his family were travelling in hit a landmine in South Sudan's northern town of Bentiu. His grandmother was killed. His left leg was shattered and had to be amputated.Stephen was flown to a physical rehabilitation centre run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Juba, which serves both as a prosthetics factory and a hospital for patients coming from all around the country to be fitted with new limbs.""It helped me to go to school,"" Stephen says shyly, pointing to his artificial leg.After receiving his first prosthesis in 2013, war prevented Stephen from being able to return for new fittings every six months as recommended. When he finally made it to the centre this month, his prosthesis was far too short.South Sudan's five-year-long civil war has left possibly tens of thousands of people without limbs -- a toll that may never be accurately established.Approximately 60 percent of the patients who come to the Juba centre -- one of three in the country -- have gunshot-related injuries and disabilities, according to the ICRC.But much of the country faces limited access to healthcare, a result of fighting or simply a lack of infrastructure, with roads typically being utterly impassable during the rainy season. Many limbs are amputed for no other reason than lack of treatment.""A simple injury or fracture that could be treated easily in most countries... can result in infections here which result in an amputation because of problems with healthcare,"" said ICRC prosthetic specialist Regis Tiffeneau.""The large majority of patients are affected by the war in one way or the other.""Others became disabled by polio, rickets -- linked to malnutrition -- or other diseases that have been eliminated in so many other parts of the world.Lack of accessIn the factory, plaster is slapped on models of legs whirring on machines as workers shape them and then slather them in dark brown plastic.Workshop manager Emmanuel Loubari said that the prosthesis can be made within a day of a patient being measured and a cast taken. Last year the centre made 580 prosthetic limbs, with the cost of all treatment borne by the ICRC.But many challenges face patients who need to get fittings.""We have a lot of patients who are supposed to be fitted, but they cannot have access to the centre,"" Loubari said.In South Sudan, roads are so bad that the ICRC relies on a fleet of planes and helicopters to bring patients to hospitals and the physical rehabilitation centres.In the rainy season, it can be hard to land in many remote locations.Bringing people from across the country, injured in fighting mostly of an ethnic nature, brings its own problems.""They come here, they are traumatised, most of them are injured by gunshots and mines,"" said social worker James Soma. ""We talk to them about forgiveness.""He said an argument had broken out the previous day in which one patient accused another of targeting her because of her tribe, and said she would ""bring one of my relatives and shoot you all.""Toddlers shot on mothers' backsFor those who have used a prosthesis before, like Stephen, it takes only two or three days before they are ready to go home. But for new patients it can take a few weeks.Other patients at the centre currently include a young man with severe scoliosis -- a curved spine -- who was being taken to school in a wheelbarrow until he was brought in to get a customised wheelchair.Another was bitten by a snake and was not treated for almost two weeks, so his leg had to be amputated.""We have a lot of children coming in,"" said physiotherapist Oketta Robert Kanyara. ""We have five children in the centre, shot in different styles... We have children shot while tied to their mothers' backs.""Five-year-old Laytol was probably bitten by a snake. Her mother comes from the Murle people, and the doctors have difficulty understanding the language. But they believe her leg ""could probably have been saved"" if she had got help in time.Laytol is trying out her new leg for the first time, balancing herself calmly between two metal bars.Kanyara, the physiotherapist, said training children requires using games, as they do not understand the idea of shifting their weight and struggle to follow instructions.But progress can be made. When the physiotherapist started work with Stephen, the boy who lost his leg in a landmine in 2013, the challenges were many.""It was very, very difficult,"" Kanyara said. ""You tell him to do weight bearing, but he starts crying, so you have to go slowly.""Little Laytol took to her new leg more quickly.""She is very good,"" Kanyara said. ""She is fitted today, and she is not crying. She is walking.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/New-limbs-new-life-South-Sudan-amputees/688340-5074470-6qk10n/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post37.png
38,Notre-Dame counts cost as daylight reveals damage - Daily Monitor,"Shards of stained glass from priceless medieval windows, and a gaping hole above the choir area where the spire crashed down: daylight reveals the extent of damage at Notre-Dame cathedral on Tuesday morning as firefighters put out the last smouldering remains of the fire.Philippe Marsset, the vicar general of Notre-Dame, was among the first to enter the storied Gothic cathedral whose sculpted arches have been blackened by smoke and pews destroyed.""It felt like I was looking at a bombing,"" Marsset said of the church where he was ordained a priest 31 years ago.""It was hell,"" he said, describing the moment when the blaze was discovered on the soaring roof shortly after evening mass ended shortly before 7:00 pm (1700 GMT) on Monday.Church officials raced to remove as many artefacts, paintings and other cultural treasures they could before being evacuated by firefighters as they tried to stop the flames from spreading.Flames and smoke are seen billowing from the roof at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15, 2019.But the blaze kept springing up as globs of molten lead fell from the soaring heights of the church.""All night long I saw men going past with tears in their eyes. I described it this way: It was total chaos, but we can't let it knock us down,"" Marsset said.""This church was built 850 years ago. It withstood the wars, it withstood the bombings, it resisted everything,"" he said. Yet not all was lost: the crucifix standing over the main altar was one of several objects which escaped destruction.""I'm devastated, even if I haven't been a Catholic for a long time,"" 88-year-old Claire told AFP at the scene on Tuesday morning. ""I was baptised here.""On the banks of the river Seine, hundreds of Parisians and tourists stopped by on Tuesday morning to take pictures or gaze at the disaster site, many still stunned by the damage. 'Heroic' ""This isn't some little church that was damaged -- it's the symbol of the history of France and of Paris,"" Marsset said, noting that all distances from Paris are calculated from the square in front of Notre-Dame.But in the end there was relief that much was able to be saved, with much of stonework as well as the two massive square bell towers largely unscathed.US soldiers walk and take pictures on the Pont de l'Archev ch  near Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on October 01, 1944Most of the emblematic rose windows of medieval stained glass were also spared, including the huge round window dominating the church's intricately carved western facade.""We're all just dumbfounded. It's more than miraculous, it's heroic,"" Marsset said, calling the firefighters who toiled throughout the night ""heroes.""But he appeared lost for words when asked about what would happen now, as Christians worldwide prepared to celebrate Easter next Sunday.""We had things planned for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday -- We don't yet know where to do these. It's as if our mother has been wounded,"" he said.""My bed was right there,"" he adds, pointing towards the cathedral, where smoke continued to rise into the sky Tuesday morning.""It's not the Notre-Dame (Our Lady) of Catholics. It's Notre-Dame of France, Notre-Dame of the world,"" he adds.

39,Egypt parliament votes on extending Sisi rule - Daily Monitor,"Egypt's parliament, packed with loyalists of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is to vote Tuesday on changes to the constitution that could keep the former military chief in power until 2030.The proposed amendments were initially introduced in February by a parliamentary bloc supportive of Sisi and updated this week after several rounds of parliamentary debates.It includes changing Article 140 of the constitution to allow the Egyptian president to extend his current four-year term, which ends in 2022, by two years.A further change would permit Sisi to stand for another six-year term and potentially remain president until 2030.Sisi led the army's overthrow of elected president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 following mass protests against the Islamist leader's rule.He won his first term as president in 2014 and was re-elected in March 2018 with more than 97 percent of the vote, after standing virtually unopposed.His government has been widely criticised by human rights groups for the repression of political opponents.But Mohamed Abu-Hamed, one of the members of parliament who pushed for constitutional amendments to keep Sisi in power, is adamant that the changes are a must.""The constitution in 2014 was written under tough exceptional circumstances,"" he told AFP.He hailed Sisi as a president who ""took important political, economic and security measures... (and) must continue with his reforms,"" in the face of the unrest gripping neighbouring countries following the toppling of veteran president Omar al-Bashir in Sudan and the escalation of the conflict in Libya.Keeping Sisi in power, he added, reflects ""the will of the people"". 'Authoritarian rule' Since Sisi overthrew Morsi, Egypt has drawn heavy international criticism for its sweeping crackdown on dissent. The authorities have jailed thousands of Morsi's supporters as well as liberal and secular activists, including a popular blogger, actors, singers and journalists. Last week, Human Rights Watch warned that the amendments, which would also increase the military's political role and grant Sisi control over the judiciary, would ""institutionalise authoritarianism"".As Sisi visited Washington for talks with President Donald Trump, it urged Congress, to withhold endorsement of the Egyptian president's bid to extend his rule.""Congress needs to use its levers to pressure the Egyptian president to reverse course, starting with withdrawing these constitutional amendments set to consolidate authoritarian rule,"" said HRW's Michael Page.As well as a crackdown on dissent, Sisi has overseen a military campaign against Islamic State group-linked militants based in the Sinai PeninsulaOn Tuesday, the 596-seat parliament will also vote on a controversial article which critics fear might allow the military a greater influence in Egyptian political life.The vote is expected to be swift after the bill passed by an overwhelming majority earlier this year.If the bill is passed by a majority of two thirds, parliament will then hold a referendum in which Egyptians will vote on the raft of amendments.Other proposed amendments include a quota for women's representation of no less than 25 percent in parliament and forming a second parliamentary chamber.Human rights groups and opposition parties say the government has intensified its crackdown on dissent with a wave of arrests ahead of the vote.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Egypt-parliament-votes-extending-Sisi-rule/688340-5073706-vmgxd7z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post39.png

Some 3,000 people were killed.Smoke and flames rise during a fire at the landmark Notre-Dame Cathedral in central Paris on April 15, 2019, potentially involving renovation works being carried out at the site, the fire service said.A spokesman for YouTube, which is owned by Google, said the text box feature had been disabled for live streams related to the fire.""These panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call,"" the spokesman told AFP. ""We are deeply saddened by the ongoing fire at the Notre-Dame Cathedral.""The feature, which also links to other outside sources such as Wikipedia, was introduced last year after YouTube faced intense criticism over videos containing misleading and extreme content.

41,"Boeing under pressure amid cancelled flights, Trump tweets - Daily Monitor","Boeing faces a wave of flight cancelations by US airlines and pressure from President Donald Trump to rebrand its top-selling 737 MAX aircraft, a month after the plane was grounded worldwide in the wake of two deadly crashes.American and Southwest Airlines say the grounding will disrupt scheduled flights through the summer, during the peak travel season which helps generate corporate profits.American is cancelling all 737 MAX flights through August 19 while Southwest, which owns the largest 737 MAX fleet, with 34 planes, is cancelling them until August 5.United Airlines said it had previously used spare aircraft and ""creative solutions"" to keep from having to cancel flights but cancelations in the busy summer travel season could no longer be avoided.""No one knows when the FAA review will be complete, so we've decided to pull MAX flights out of our schedule through early July,"" a spokesperson told AFP on Monday.In all, an average of 275 flights a day will be cancelled, which are likely to put a dent in airline profits and could cause the companies to raise airfares.American already cut a key industry revenue metric -- Total Revenue per Available Seat-Mile, or TRASM -- saying it will rise one percent in 2019, down from a prior estimate of two percent.Southwest is allowing affected passengers to reschedule flights at no additional cost.""Neither Airbus nor Boeing like cancelations and there are stiff contracts which make this very difficult,"" said Scott Hamilton, managing editor of the aviation news site Leeham News and Analysis.""The companies will swap airplane types, however, if it comes to this.""All 737 MAX aircraft have been banned from the world's skies since mid-March after suffering two fatal crashes less than five months apart: a Lion Air flight crashed in the Java Sea in October, leaving 189 dead, and the Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, which killed 157 people.Crash investigators have zeroed in on the planes' anti-stall system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS.And Boeing, which has already ceased 737 MAX deliveries and slowed the pace of production, a buildup of delays could increase the penalties it must pay client airlines, Hamilton said.Trump tweeted early Monday that Boeing had to give its scandal-stricken aircraft a new image. Rebuilding trust ""What do I know about branding, maybe nothing (but I did become President!), but if I were Boeing, I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX, add some additional great features, & REBRAND the plane with a new name,"" he said.But Hamilton said Trump was right to doubt his own expertise.""Trump is a boob. Boeing isn't going to rebrand the 737,"" Hamilton said, pointing to Boeing's log of more than 4,600 backorders, a key sales revenue driver, and adding that the order cancelations so far were ""inconsequential.""Aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group agreed.""Pretty much all of President Trump's pronouncements on aviation are safely and best ignored,"" he said.Boeing is finalizing software upgrades for the MCAS, which it has pledged to submit to regulators in the coming weeks so that the 737 MAX grounding order can be lifted.""We're focused on testing and implementing the software update and rebuilding the trust of our airline customers, pilots and the traveling public,"" a spokesperson told AFP.""We know we have a deep responsibility to everyone who flies on our airplanes to ensure that the MAX is one of the safest aircraft ever to fly.""Rebranding the aircraft would impose additional costs on the airlines which would be required to fully retrain pilots, while an updated model involves less intense additional training.Flight cancelations show the airlines, that had hoped to have the planes back in the air by May, now expect it will be longer before the aircraft can return to service.Aviation analysts largely agree and expect the grounding to be lifted by the end of August.In the meantime, the industry is working to regain the trust of the flying public.The US Federal Aviation Administration, which must certify the 737 MAX's airworthiness, released a video last week in which its interim chief Daniel Elwell said the agency was working to keep pilots informed.The FAA also said the agency would not rush to get the 737 MAX flying again.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Boeing-under-pressure-amid-canceled-flights-Trump-tweets/688340-5073504-7y0kr5z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post41.png
42,UN appoints envoy to work with African Union on Sudan crisis - Daily Monitor,"UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appointed an envoy to Sudan to work with the African Union on mediating an end to the crisis sparked by a military takeover.Nicholas Haysom, a South African lawyer who has served as UN envoy in Somalia, Afghanistan as well as for Sudan and South Sudan, will support AU-led mediation efforts between the military and civil society, said spokesman Stephane Dujarric.The African Union has called on Sudan's military to hand over power to a civilian government within 15 days and strongly condemned the army takeover as a coup d'etat.The AU peace and security council has threatened to suspend Sudan from the 55-nation organization if it does not move to establish civilian rule.""The African Union put out a very clear statement,"" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. Haysom will ""do whatever he can to support their efforts.""

43,US says Sudan new regime can exit terror list - Daily Monitor,"The United States is willing to remove Sudan from its blacklist of state sponsors of terrorism if its new military leaders take tangible steps, a US official said Tuesday.Sudanese officials have for years sought to get off the list, engaging in inconclusive talks with the United States.A State Department official said that Washington had renewed its willingness to consider a delisting during meetings with the military rulers who last week ousted veteran leader Omar al-Bashir in the wake of months of street protests.A way to rescind the designation ""may be available if there is a fundamental change in the leadership and policies and if the Transitional Military Council is not supporting acts of international terrorism and provides assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.But the official said that the United States was not considering delisting Sudan ""at this time.""The comments come two days after the top US diplomat in Khartoum, Charge d'Affaires Steven Koutsis, met with the deputy head of the military council, Mohammad Hamdan Daglo.The US official said that the United States was also encouraging the military council to ""move quickly"" to include civilians in the interim government and hold elections.Protesters have remained on the street, calling on the military council to step aside.The United States had turbulent relations with Sudan during Bashir's three decades in power, in which he allied himself with Islamists, was accused of plotting genocide in the Darfur region and during the 1990s gave refuge to Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden.But in his later years, Bashir sought smoother ties with the United States and especially wanted the removal of the terror label, which had severely deterred foreign investors.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/US-says-Sudan-new-regime-can-exit-terror-list/688340-5075102-ks7ap8/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post43.png
44,Professional course will add you clout - Daily Monitor,"A year after Ramarah Nakungu graduated with a Bachelors of Commerce, she had not found a job. She figured that despite her degree being an honours, she needed to get more qualifications to add weight to it. She thus enrolled at Uganda Management Institute (UMI) for Chartered Public Accountants (CPA). Now an auditor with EFC bank, she does not regret taking on the course. Although there are not many professional courses in Uganda, there is a chance for graduates to pursue any of the available ones as the membership will not only market you in Uganda but also globally. Vincent Owori, a lecturer in CPA and CIPS at Venus Business and Communication, says academic qualifications only help one to learn the theory part of the course as there is more to any course practically.  A course such as Certified Public Account (CPA) will make you stand out of the crowd of the many accountants. Students who undergo professional courses are looked at as problem solvers with better knowledge of handling their jobs,  says Owori. Is there a right time Abdullah Mayanja, the head of professional courses department at Uganda Management Institute (UMI), says the best time would be after a degree. Through the degree background, he says, the graduate has already come across some terms that will make concepts at the professional course easy to grasp.  However, one can enroll for a professional course after O-Level such as Certified Public Accountant (CPA),  Mayanja says. The hiring questionJoweria Nansereko, a human resource and administration manager at Graben 4pl Company in Bugolobi, Kampala, says companies hire professionals because they have edge above plain graduates.  A procurement manager with CIPS is equipped with more knowledge and practicability than one with only a degree,  she says. Why the fuss   Employers and company clients feel more secure and safer with someone they feel is equipped with all competencies necessary for the job,  Nakungu, a CPA, says. Because most professional courses are international, one who pursues it can work abroad if they have to or want to.  ACCA, a UK course, is recognised in more than 170 countries in the world,  says Mayanja.Some courses offered in Uganda  Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Association of Business Executives (ABE) Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM)[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Professional-course-will-add-you-clout/688336-5071398-i6krc9z/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post44.png
45,Seeing students excel is my joy - Daily Monitor,"To Samuel Businde Saalongo, 38, nothing gives him more satisfaction than meeting technicians doing good work from institutions he has served in. Born to Edward Saalongo and Joyce Kalema, Businde is the principal, Lady Aidah Computer Based Institute of Fashion Design and Technology in Wakiso, and also patron Uganda Association of Private Vocational Institutions (UGAPRIVI) Kampala District chapter. He is also a duly registered technical instructor. Businde studied at Kezekiya Memorial Primary School in Rakai from 1987 to 93, then joined Kibaale Community Secondary School for O-Level and completed in 1999 with Aggregate 28. In 2000, I joined Kammengo Technical Institute with a goal to be a water engineer. I studied plumbing. This was a course least known to us by then but I was attracted to it because the sector was fast developing in Uganda,  Businde says. After he completed his Advanced level (Craft part Il) in 2003, and because he was an active student, the principal of the school then, (Charles Ebong) offered him an opportunity to start teaching. I eagerly accepted and he sent me to Kabira Technical Institute-Bushenyi in August 2003.  Young as I was, I went out ready to teach plumbing before our exams were even released,  he recalls.Since then, Businde never looked back but instead appreciated it more.  Teaching was very flexible. I even had time to get simple contracts of installing water in some buildings within Kabira and Ishaka Town as I trained students at the institute,  he says.Decision timeIn 2005, he decided to go back to school but this time to train as a teacher. He enrolled for an in-service Technical Teachers Education programme at Kal Institute of Technical Teacher Education (KaLIOTTE) where he got a certificate that made him register as a qualified teacher.In 2008, he joined the Royal Institute of Technical Teacher Education to head the department of plumbing and later on, was appointed deputy principal to coordinate academics and skills training at the institute. In 2009, Businde joined Kampala Polytechnic, Mengo to upgrade with a Diploma in Water Engineering for two years and in 2015 asked to serve as a visiting principal at Uganda Children s Centre Vocational and Technical Institute on Salaama Road.Through the ranksBusinde notes that growing through the ranks in vocational education requires thorough knowledge about the dynamics in the sector but he says he was able to do this because he had committed mentors who helped him actualise the leadership roles and as well as teaching.  Simon Kisasa, the former Uganda National Examinations Board deputy executive secretary and Emmanuel Bampiigga, the former national chairman UGAPRIVI, are the people who have continuously modelled me,  he confesses. Motivation  In leading and training, I aim at seeing people who go through my hands able to apply the skills acquired but also able to upgrade their studies. My core task is to make them get more informed so as to equally compete with the challenges in the world of work,  says Businde.Though one of the most evident challenges of vocational education in the country is the negative attitude by both parents and students especially due to lack of sensitisation, Businde is proud that more people, even professors have started to understand the impact of vocational education at all levels.It is also against this backdrop that he established a voluntary organisation; Change Education Attitude, Uganda, that goes around the country sensitising Ugandans, parents in particular, to embrace and harness vocational education. We make them appreciate that vocational education is purposeful because it introduces the students directly to the world of work and opens doors for advancing,  says Businde. Challenges Being a leader in a private vocational institute, he says, they encounter several challenges including, low enrollment of students, heavy taxes in procuring training materials, equipment and tools; and low fees charged by schools which makes running of these institutions difficult.  This results into poor remuneration which affects skills training and might lead to passing out incompetent personnel. Additionally, the public has not yet accepted that one can progressively go through technical education right from community polytechnic up to PhD,  he notes. Furthermore, Businde believes it is everyone s role to support Business Technical Vocational Education and Training (BTVET) by sensitising the public to realise the potential value in it.  I implore all of us to appreciate that the only way to fight unemployment and poverty out of Uganda is in BTVET,  Businde implores. Brief bio1987-1993.

46,Suicide: What is plaguing university students  - Daily Monitor,"On March 21, 2019 Ugandans woke up to news that Arthur Basalirwa, a student of Makerere University Business School (MUBS), had committed suicide. A few hours before his death, Basalirwa had posted on one of his social media accounts saying,  I am sorry but it s too late, I m sorry too much weighing on me, I do not want to live to see another day. Basalirwa had posted several other statements on social media earlier in the month which friends were later to realise were revelations that he was going through tough times but did not think deeply about them until they learnt about his death.In September 2018, Joshua Ajuna was found dead in his room in Nsibirwa Hall at Makerere University. Next to his body was a bottle of suspected poison and two suicides notes. According to the notes, personal reasons had driven Ajuna to kill himself. Earlier in April 2011, Francis Kigenyi, 23, had jumped to his death from the fifth floor of Baskon hostel on Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road in Kampala. Before his death, Kigenyi had told guests at his birthday party that his life was worthless and referred to himself as a ghost.Yet Joshua Nuwasasira, 22, a second-year student of Makerere University Business School, Mbarara study centre had in 2012, also committed suicide after he apparently spent every penny of his tuition fees on drinking and partying. He was found hanging in his rented room in Nkokonjeru, Mbarara.These are some of the suicide cases that have been reported at universities over the years, making the situation worrying. What could drive a student who is largely dependent on their parents to take their own life  DepressionAccording to Margaret Kyosaba Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, the main reason for suicides among university students is depression. She says this depression in most cases arises from maladjusted relationships, financial challenges, stress, academic anxiety, low self-esteem, drug abuse, poor performance, career indecision, uncertainty about post-school life and other informational needs. I have had chance to interact with some students who are contemplating suicide; most of them feel as though there is no way out of their situation. They are bombarded with feelings of hopelessness, fear, isolation, hatred toward themselves and so much more. The pain they feel is often immeasurable, to a point where they see no other option but to end their lives,  she explains.How can you tell Jean Nuwagaba, the head of counselling department Kyambogo University, says when a student is depressed, they may show signs of being overly sensitive to how they are perceived by others, their failures, and their relationships. They will also show signs of hopelessness, helplessness, unexplained fear of people, places, events, or objects (phobias), escapism, and general unusual or unacceptable behaviour such as drug abuse and unwarranted sexual escapades. She says sometimes some of these people overuse defense mechanisms such as denial, blame, and projection which are also indicative of mental health issues.Nevertheless, Nuwagaba says a student in such a state can get assistance through psychological interventions such as counselling, guidance, and other forms of psychosocial support.  Extreme cases should be taken to clinical psychologists or psychiatrists for further treatment,  she says.Sometimes students get depressed but fail to get anybody to talk to yet counsellors say talking can go a long way in helping one overcome painful circumstances.University intervention Ritah Namisango, the spokesperson Makerere University, says Makerere University (Mak) has a functional Counselling and Guidance Centre. The Mak Counselling and Guidance Centre is headed by a manager who is supported by professional counsellors. The managers and counsellors are fulltime members of staff at the university. The centre provides professional counselling services to both students and staff and the services are available to help students deal with and solve challenges of living that would otherwise affect their academic achievement and their wholesome being in general. She explains that the centre handles issues such as academics; for instance failure to understand or conceptualise what is taught and failure to make the required grades. It also handles psychological problems such as sexual dysfunctions, family problems, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, bereavement, and love relationships such as being dumped by a lover, failure to relate with a lover or other people, failure to quit an oppressive relationship, as well as psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, drug addiction, sexual harassment, HIV/Aids counselling.Apart from providing students with career guidance, the guidance and counselling unit provides first year students with a fresher s orientation where they explain to new entrants the dos and don ts of university life. During this fresher s orientation week, we give every new student at Makerere University an instruction booklet, which is meant to guide them on their life at university,  she says. This, she explains, is to minimise cases of transitional challenges.But Namisango is quick to note that the attendance of these guidance and counselling services is voluntary.At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.Luckily, she adds that the unit has handled quite a number of depression cases among students so far.  Ever since the inception of this facility, we have tried to popularise our services among students, by distributing flyers to students, notices on noticeboards around the university and making outreaches in student hostels,  she explains.Why are students adamant Unfortunately, some students are not embracing counselling and guidance services yet. According to Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, though universities have created counselling departments, some students are still skeptical to go in for these services. She says some are afraid of being seen by their peers obtaining such services. It is unfortunate that though counselling is very vital for university students, some find it uncalled for and shaming,  she says, adding that for this reason at Kyambogo, they have started online counselling services to help students who would prefer online to physical meetings. Namisango also admits that though the counselling services are free, some students opt out since they are not compulsory. Way forward Biribonwa says it is high time university students accepted that everyone gets depressed at some point in their lives. However, how long it lasts is one of the key factors to determine the severity.  If depression has lasted for more than two weeks and it is affecting your day-to-day life, it is time to get treatment,  she advises.Biribonwa insists that there is absolutely no shame in getting help adding that it is important for any student who is depressed to talk to friends and open up honestly about their feelings.  If you are feeling down, tell them that. If you need someone to talk to, tell them that, too. You might be surprised by how willing they are to help you get through it,  she advises.InterventionsStudent mentors. At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.

47,Why you need to check that school before sending your child there - Daily Monitor,"There are a number of advertisement activities that schools engage in to attract students which sometimes do not replicate what is on the ground. And a lot of times, some aspects which may impact on your child negatively might be happening at their school behind your back. Agnes Mweteise, was two years ago convinced to take her daughter to a school in Mbarara. She was largely excited about the school s performance in that year s O-Level results that were advertised extensively in the media.But a year after, the school s performance was different and a parent had raised the issue on how the administration always advertises wrong results to dupe them about the performance.  We were surprised when one of us armed with results from the newspaper cuttings found that they were not similar to those of Uganda National Examinations Board. The one advertised in the newspaper showed they had 10 students in Division One while those of UNEB showed that the school had got none,  said Mweteise who withdrew her daughter immediately. Milton Batekateka, a retired primary school teacher, blames the liberalisation policy in education and inadequate inspection, saying education officers should be keen on whatever material schools advertise in media. Mbarara district education officer, Gabriel Ahimbisibwe, warned that schools which dupe parents risk being de-registered and administrators arrested.  Any school found to be engaging in this practice will be de-registered. It is a very bad and dangerous strategy of attracting students,  says Ahimbisibwe. Low school charges Some schools charge rather very low school fees but are these commensurate to the services or what a student or pupil needs for his career development and social welfare Laban Kanywa, the chairperson Federation of Non State Institutions in Western Uganda, says parents should interest themselves in schools that charge very low school fees especially on how they go about the costs of running these schools. Those charging very low fees are only interested in the numbers but not in the standard of education. It is these schools where teachers are not paid or are unprofessional or starve students,  says Kanywa. Every TV, radio station and newspapers at the beginning of the school s term are awash with advertisements of schools. Adverts such as  we have professional staff, science laboratory, well-stocked library, swimming pool, and balanced diet , among others are common but as a parent do you take a step further to investigate whether these actually exist Andrew Kankiriho noted that the commercialisation of education has driven schools to employ all tricks to attract students. One of the schools here in Mbarara even duped the President. It claims to teach science and technology but when the President was going to visit the school, they hired old computers, welding and fabrication machines, sewing machines and forged a workshop, imagine,  said Kankiriho. He challenges parents to always do ground check on schools before enrolling children but added that even after they enrol, parents should always check on the capacity of the school to meet their expectations. Emotional violenceUnlike other forms of violence, emotional violence does not leave physical scars but wounds the heart which lowers one s esteem, dignity, and self-worth. It includes constant belittling, shaming, humiliating, negative comparisons, and frequent yelling and bullying. Nathan Mugume, the head teacher Mbarara Junior School, admits this kind of violence exists in schools and it has very disastrous effects even to a nation; such as having a violent nation. If a teacher is violent, abusive to pupils they may grow up to have violent and abusive families. As teachers we should guide, counsel, discuss and show empathy to pupils because we can either kill or build their future,  says Mugume.He says parents need to always interest themselves in checking their children s behaviour but also monitor the behaviour of school managers and staff towards the pupils.Third partiesDue to commercialisation of education, competition has forced schools to hire private brokers and agents who comb areas looking for students while spreading the  excellence  gospel of the schools.Unsuspecting parents easily get convinced by these brokers, forgetting that these are only interested in getting paid and whatever happens after is none of their business.  During our days, competition was driven by performance but now it is about the numbers you can attract just for economic gain. Why do you employ brokers if your school is sending pupils to first class institutions with good courses   Esau Muhangi, a retired secondary school teacher, asks.This is where the trouble lies. Pupils are in schools not just to learn but also make business for the proprietor.In case you check... Security. The general security at the school and in the neighbourhood should be safe. Care. Some teachers do not have proper handling of students even when they are disciplining them. Ability to teach. This is not just about having professional teachers but those who are able to teach.Hygiene. Are the toilets, latrine, kitchen, dining area and classrooms in good condition  Behaviour. The behaviour of students in a given school can give you a picture of whether it is a good school or not. Plans. Ask about the future plans of the school, especially if the school is new or just building up momentum.Performance. Consider student performance, not just in P7, S4 or S6, but the other classes too.Games. Ensure that the school pays attention and develops learners through co-curricular activities.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Check-that-school-before-sending-your-child-there/688336-5060788-hpnsow/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post47.png
48,Dedicated to pupils with special needs - Daily Monitor,"Maria Nansubuga Galiwango was supposed to be a journalist. That is what she longed for as a child. She thought that each of her days would be filled with an adventure of travelling to new places.Instead, after completing Senior Four, her elder brother encouraged her to become a teacher because of her love for children. That was the turning point as Nansubuga joined Gaba Teachers College where she graduated with a certificate in primary school teaching. It was the beginning of the journey into the unknown. She got a job at a school that she never thought would change her life forever.Tough startIn 2012, Nansubuga joined Hill Preparatory School, Naguru, kickstarting her journey in teaching.  I was given an inclusion class but that was a big challenge,  the 32-year-old said.An inclusive class has learners with disabilities and special education learning alongside their non-disabled peers. I had no interest at first. I was even afraid but after prayer I realised that this was a special group of people God had allowed me to reach,  Nansubuga recalls.As we sat for the interview, the love from the children was evident. A couple of them played with her while some hugged her, interrupting the session at several stages.Getting into the grooveA multi-talented teacher, Nansubuga later completed her diploma at Uganda Martyrs University-Nkozi in 2015 courtesy of the school director Clare Wavamunno and head teacher Ambrose Kibuuka. She attended several school trainings at Lugogo in Kampala which were regularly organised by Special Olympics Uganda as well as Umoja Global Community Music Therapy. The British Council also offered her an opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom in 2014 during an exchange programme to improve her skills of teaching special needs children.  I picked interest in furthering my knowledge of special needs education because I found these children amazing. They are so loving and I started seeing Jesus in them,  she said.Another dimensionNansubuga who teaches English and Mathematics, currently conducts private lessons at the convenience of the parents  homes for the last one year.Although she left Hill last year, she still goes there to conduct swimming lessons on a private arrangement.Nansubuga said she is now married to teaching even though she opted to start her private classes which she says offered her greener pastures. There are some parents who are still not comfortable bringing their special needs children in public and I find that an opportunity to reach out to them and help them develop,  she said.Nansubuga said she chose that approach because it is exciting yet she has a passion for seeing children with special needs excel. For special needs children, there s something new everyday, she says. They are fun and can be a challenge sometimes especially children with intellectual disabilities but we get to know each other. Nansubuga believes a good special needs educator is someone who has a passion for what they teach, and who you teach.  Being flexible and passionate is something I take pride in as an educator. I constantly talk to them to be able to build self-esteem. She was forced into swimming to tame autistic children who are normally hyper, especially after lunch making it necessary to curb extra energy.The common intellectual disability cases she has handled include; autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Each of those cases are handled differently and that is the best lesson I have learned in life. Everyone is different from the other,  she notes, adding that loving such children is what makes us human.Moving onNansubuga agrees that she cannot get all the money she needs from teaching as such she handles different projects. After opting to leave Hill Preparatory School last year, she joined Kampala International Pre-School in Naguru before she settled at Bourneville International School. She supplements this by working in a network marketing company, Success, which deals in cryptocurrencies. I do personal work with Success online and I never have to worry about my teaching appointments,  she says about her balancing act.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Dedicated-pupils-with-special-needs/688336-5060824-glwrmwz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post48.png
49,Are we sending pupils to boarding school too early  - Daily Monitor,"Gloria Namukisa sent her daughter to boarding school while she was in Primary Two. She says she was forced to make this decision by the challenges in commuting to school daily. But Namukisa also reveals, that is a decision she was later to regret.  I counselled her for several weeks before enrolling her; making her ready for the time I would not be around. I taught her how to wash her clothes, how to bathe, take care of her things, but also to psychologically prepare her to know that she will be responsible for most of her property. Most importantly I was encouraging her that everything would be fine,  she explains. However, things did not go as Namukisa expected.  Within two weeks, the other children had stolen her key, and swept her suitcase clean. The only thing she remained with were her bed sheets and blanket,  she recalls. But that was not all.  She came back a bit different. She would get nightmares and later told me that her fellow pupils told her that evil spirits come at night looking for children. She was also more selfish and did not want anyone to touch her belongings. This really got me rethinking my decision and what I needed to do,  she explains. Namukisa, a tailor, decided to move her tailoring shop to the neighbourhood she lived so that she could have her daughter in day school.Boarding schools are becoming more common than they were in the recent past. Originally the most common boarding schools were secondary ones. Today, almost every primary school has a boarding section and some schools have made it compulsory for some classes.  Growing up, my older siblings only joined boarding school in secondary school, and even then, my mother would remain worried that at Senior One they were still too young for boarding school. It was my father who always insisted on the move,  Faith Musinguzi, a parent, recalls.But thanks to the parents who have embraced boarding school in numbers, schools are admitting children from the age of five into the boarding sections. Seeing children aged as young as five standing next to mattresses and suitcases bigger than them on reporting day is now a common phenomenon. One wonders how a child who can barely do homework on their own will wash their clothes, take care of their possessions or themselves. Although nobody has earmarked the right age at which a child should join boarding school, the debate is; are we taking our children to boarding school too early  There are growing concerns that children are being sent to boarding school at a very young age and for some this has come with adverse effects on their lives. File photoBetter option Angella Ankunda, who took her now six-year-old daughter to boarding school when she was five, says in some cases, boarding school is a better option.  If you can leave a three-months-old baby with a house maid and go to work, it would be hypocritical to say that taking a five-year-old to boarding school is the worst thing one can do,  she asserts. She also argues that instead of leaving your child with a help who might expose them to some bad behaviour or abuse them, why not leave them at school where they will be in a more guided and controlled environment  Truth is, it is painful to part with your child at a very young age but circumstances often dictate to parents,  says Ankunda. But Matilda Namuyaba, a school matron at White Angels Primary School, Masajja, shares that although they try to give more attention to the younger pupils, they cannot provide all the care.  Since they are many, you cannot give all of them the maximum attention and care they deserve. So, some fall sick and you learn of it later when they are bedridden because they did not tell you or you were too preoccupied to observe. Some young ones even cry in the night when they want their parents, especially when they have just joined the school. Others are too stubborn to listen to you as the matron because they only listen to their parents,  she shares some of their challenges as caretakers. She further advises that a child should be sent to boarding school when they at least know the basics.  If a child is able to wash their clothes, bathe, fetch their own water, get their own meals and know when to eat, take care of their belongings and manage most of their affairs or relate easily with others, then these may find boarding school easier than those who cannot. Though we help them, we cannot do everything,  Namuyaba states. Psychological implications Lois Nakibuuka, a counselling psychologist, shares that parents or guardians are the first people who influence their child s life, view of the world and the people in it.  To be separated from them at a young age for boarding school gives them deep anxiety and bewilderment. This may even cause a child to wonder what they could possibly have done to deserve the punishment of being taken off to a strange environment and then try to cope on their own by non-social skills,  she notes. These may include; interacting and navigating the environment in an awkward, weird, or odd manner, antagonising others, teasing others frequently, being emotionally immature, among others. And other issues ranging from anxiety, low self-esteem. Emotional and mental scarring for life may also occur. The inability to sustain lasting emotional relationships may also be as a result of a child feeling unwanted. They may wonder that if they are not good enough for their parents to want them at home, how can they be good enough for anybody else to want them in their lives   Nakibuuka adds. She further advises that talking them through the reasons why you are taking them to boarding school way ahead of time will allow them to wrap their heads around the idea and get used to it.  Tell them about the situations that are leading them to this difficult solution. For example; if a child has to navigate a long route to school, ask them what danger they could encounter and how it can be solved. Point out the advantages of being in boarding school but also tell them what to expect realistically,  she says.The performance issue However, amid the debate on age and boarding school is the delusion; by teachers, school owners and parents that boarding school equals great academic results.  My son has always been an average student right from primary school though he was in boarding school. But when he joined secondary school; day section, the teachers started pestering me to bring him to boarding section. Every time they invited us for a parent s meeting to look at their assessment marks in the remedial examinations, the one and only solution that all teachers had to his poor results was enrolling him in the boarding section,  Geoffrey Kazibwe confesses. He recalls teachers advising that when he enrols his Senior Two son into boarding section, he will be surprised at how drastic his grades would improve.  They used this marketing language like they were more concerned about his grades than I was, that it made me think that probably, the teachers get a commission on every student who enrols in the boarding section!  Kazibwe asserts. Other alternativesRichard Muhumuza shares that there are some alternatives parents can consider.  For example, I still felt that my Senior One daughter was still too young for boarding school. What I did was to have her in a student hostel owned by her school (Mengo Secondary School). She stays at hostel during weekdays but comes back home for the weekend,  This way, he is able to strike a balance between her study time and time with her. There are some primary and secondary schools that offer weekly boarding to students such as Greenhill Academy and Rainbow International School. Alternatively, home-schooling may be the way to go for some parents. All the parent has to do is hire a qualified teacher to teach their child. This is not only convenient, but will also give the parents ample time with their child. However, Emmanuel Mugarura, the head of education at Kampala Smart School, an organisation that offers home-schooling services, says before parents choose to home-school their children, there are key aspects to note such as designing a personal learning plan and academic framework for the child.  This includes selecting a curriculum, instructional resources, learning applications and continuity plans,  he explains. Mugarura adds that a parent needs to also have the chance to provide weekly opportunities where the child meets with other children for interaction to boost their social skills. Some education experts argue that 10 should be the minimun age at which a child should join boarding school which is not the situation on ground. PHOTO BY ALEX ESAGALAExplore onlinePauline Mukisa, an online course moderator and digital enthusiast, shares that learning can now be online.  The only challenge so far is that local content may be limited, but a child can apply for an international curriculum in an international school and then study online. The thought may still be far from many people s minds but it could be something to look at, especially now that more people are embracing digitisation,  she says. For parents intent on keeping their children in a day school environment, a purely day school could be the solution for you.  The advantages of purely day schools is that the classes are timetabled in a way that will be convenient for all students. Classes start at 8am and end at 5pm to allow students time to move back home in time. It is usually candidate classes that have remedial classes that begin at 7am to 6pm. Additionally you will not get the school administration ordering you about a mandatory boarding section because they do not have the section in the first place,  Henry Bukembo, a teacher and parent, shares. Views on what should be the right time to take a child to school are divergent from one person to another. However, the International journal of Education and research on  The influence of boarding school to young children  (a case of Tanzania, 2016) refers to Ellen G. White s view that the suitable age for children to go to boarding school is that of 10 years. The journal also refers to the Kenyan parliament s decision in 2002 that the proper age for boarding school should be 12 years, when children are old enough.An illegal move Frances Atima, the assistant commissioner in the Directorate of Education Standards (DES), noted that boarding section arrangement is purely facilitated by parents and that government policy only emphasises access to quality education. He said this during the release of a DES report made after a survey on the standard of boarding schools in the country in November last year.The report also said 70 per cent of secondary schools are illegally operating boarding sections, having sought no permission from the relevant agencies. Atima explained that any institution which wants to have a boarding section must apply separately, be inspected and if they meet the minimum standards, be given authority to operate. Of the 800 secondary schools inspected, only 30 per cent of the schools complied with the required standards.  We already raised the red flag that many schools are operating boarding facilities without authority from the ministry. No school is registered as day and boarding other than the traditional schools, which were there in the early years,  Atima said.Is boarding school necessary Moses Kisekka, a teacher at St Kizito Primary School, shares that although boarding school has its own challenges to a child, it is necessary to impart some life skills. Though a child may be young, boarding school gives them more challenges to become responsible over their own property and life. For example, they may eat their edibles or waste their money the first time, and from that, they learn how to eat responsibly and use things sparingly, which is a skill everyone needs.He further emphasises that boarding school provides a good environment for a child to fully engage in education related activities with little distractions. Kisekka also notes the fact that boarding school can offer a better environment, especially for children who come from violent and abusive homes, who walk long distances to get to school among other circumstances.

50,"Landscaping, a new vocation course to try - Daily Monitor","Chrissy Ethel Namono, is a former accountant who loves beautiful spaces and was determined to turn that love into a job.  After working a few jobs as an accountant, I decided to quit for my passion,  the landscaper and founder Iconic Hedges, shares.  I did not grow up in a beautiful home, but when I travelled to other countries such as Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, among others, I appreciated how organised most of their homes and compounds were,  she states.In addition, every time she visited a home, she found herself rearranging it in her mind, and with time, she realised she could do more than just imagine. I only had Shs800,000 as starting capital which I used to buy a mowing machine. Clad in overalls, and a mowing machine in hand, I would move door to door looking for clients. Sometimes I would be mocked but I never gave up,  she recalls.As a landscaper, her first client was a home Namono had mowed earlier but found their compound out of shape.  I asked them whether I could put their compound back in shape. I rendered the service and the compound came out perfectly,  she exclaims.Lucrative jobIt is these that started recommending her services to other people leading to the birth of her own company - Iconic Hedges in 2016.To improve her skills, Namono had to pursue a Certificate in Landscaping with Design Concepts in Dubai, UAE. And in addition to this, she did an online design courses from Real Time Architecture.As more people appreciate beautiful homes, landscapes and gardening, in 2011, the Ministry of Education and Sports, under its Business Technical Vocational Education and Training programme rolled out an Assessment and Training Package for landscape gardeners (Level 1) for schools that train landscape gardeners. One such school is CIDI Training Centre for Gardening and Landscaping in Kampala. Edward Mutebi, 19, is a student pursuing a two-year Certificate in Landscape and Gardening at CIDI who joined the course after Senior Four.  It was difficult to choose what I would do but when I learned about gardening and landscaping, I thought that would work for me since I had studied Agriculture at O-Level and had passed it with a D2,  he shares. The first two weeks were challenging for Mutebi, especially having to learn botanical names of plants and flowers, but after counselling at the school, he was encouraged. We started going to the field and it became interesting. We would go to maintain compounds and plants, sometimes even setting a garden in place,  he recounts. Four weeks into the course, Mutebi started earning.  Recently I landscaped for a client in Bukasa, Muyenga. I designed the compound, mixed flowers and also did an accent plant for her. I earned more than Shs400,000 from this job,  he notes.About the course According to Rosemary Nampindi, a second-year student at CIDI, one of the course units is on landscape   which includes compound designing, drawing/ making compound plans, implementing a plan, maintenance of gardens. There is softscaping which deals mostly with plants and hardscaping that is composed of setting up areas, designs, platforms using constructive materials. We also study urban agriculture, which includes smart agriculture. Herbs production where we look at growing, producing and a bit of value addition of different medicinal plants and entrepreneurship, that is all about managing one s business,  she explains.Nampimbi has worked with three clients.  I worked on one compound, drew a plan for another and I have two clients I am going to draw plans for currently. Since I am just starting, I plan to sell my plans at about Shs500,000,  she says.Complementing each otherJucinta Kyobe, an animator, is surprised at how her skills in animation are gelling with with those in landscaping.  Even while doing animation, I used to do interior and exterior house designs so when I started studying landscaping, I got an idea of fusing the two because the software that we use in landscaping is like that used in animation,  she says.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Landscaping--a-new-vocation-course-try/688336-5071320-866takz/index.html,/static/img-2019-04-17/post50.png

52,Suspect narrates Kyambogo bullion van robbery scheme - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. One of the suspects in the highly-publicised bullion van robbery, which occurred on March 6 at Kyambogo, has spoken out on how the plot was hatched and executed.The suspect, Mr Alfred Wabuyi, 53, a resident of Kireka narrated the sequence of events before the press on Monday night at the Internal Security Organisation (ISO) base in Nakasero, Kampala. Clad in a long-sleeved checked shirt and black trousers, Mr Wabuyi spoke with composure for at least 40 minutes with occasional licking of his lips. The father of six children was arrested a day after the foiled robbery.Mr Wabuyi revealed that he and his accomplices held at least two meetings around the city before the mission.A former car dealer on Luwum Street, Mr Wabuyi, said he had since ventured into trading in repairing and selling weighing scales. His confession made astonishing revelations.Three days before the mission, his friend asked him to find him in town for an  urgent meeting . Upon reaching the appointed venue, a friend of his, whom he only identified as Badru, asked him to help him do a simple assignment. I received his call while at my workplace in Mutungo and when I met him in town, I found him with three other men. When I asked him the details of the assignment, he [Badru] told me that it involved driving to Mukono to pick some stuff. Since he was my friend, I didn t hesitate to help him,  he said.The following day, they held a second meeting at a place from where they were to leave for Mukono. At ISO offices on Monday night, he only identified the people he was with as Bright, Eddy, Badru and another man whose name he could not readily remember.The arrangements madeHe said from that meeting, it was agreed that he and Badru would drive a Mark II while Bright, Eddy and two others, whose details he said he could not recall, would drive a Toyota Premio to Mukono. At this time, he was told that they were going for a very big deal in Mukono.He said the deal involved trailing a bullion van from Mukono to Kampala. Apparently, one of his colleagues, Eddy, was a brother of the bullion van driver, whom he later identified as Micheal Oketch. According to Mr Wabuyi s narrative, Mr Oketch had briefed his brother, Eddy, about the deal. Eddy later briefed Bright, Badru and the other colleagues.He would later learn that Bright was a former soldier under the Special Force Command (SFC).According to the plan, the Mark II manned by Bright, Eddy and some other guys was supposed to carry the money after the robbery.They set off from Kampala to Mukono and stationed around Stanbic Bank Mukono Branch, waiting for the bullion van to return from Kayunga, where it had gone to collect the money. Mr Wabuyi said when the van arrived from Kayunga and parked at Stanbic Bank Mukono Branch, the driver picked the drinks and bread which had been laced with sedatives from them.These eats, Mr Wabuyi said, were supposed to be given to the guards manning the bullion van. It is at this time that they started trailing the van. We could overtake them and wait for them because we were getting updates from the driver. We occasionally overtook the bullion van because it made several stopovers. When it stopped at Namanve Industrial Area, the driver stopped and called Eddy, who was in the Toyota Premio with the other men since it had also parked at Namanve to bring him the polythene bags we had bought before we left for Mukono. He trusted Eddy so much because they are brothers. He feared other guys to run away with the money. All this happened while we parked at a distance in our car. Unfortunately, the polythene bags ran out of space and we were told to look for other polythene bags around Namanve. They told us that we would find them on the way,  he recounted. But they told us that the pliers they had had failed to cut the seals on the boxes which contained money. The money, which was stashed in polythene bags was just on top of the boxes and that is why it was easy for our colleagues to pack it. The guards who were aboard the bullion van had lost consciousness and one of the other guys travelling in the Toyota Premio had entered the van. It is him and the driver that were communicating with us. By this time, Mr Wabuyi and his colleague Badru didn t know how much money had been stashed in the polythene bags. He said the driver preferred the other car to shuttle the money because his brother Eddy was in it.Throughout the journey, they maintained communication on phone. The next plan was how to break the seals that contained the other money and by the time they approached Kireka, darkness had started setting in. Unfortunately, their car, ran out of fuel. They called Bright who was in the other car several times to give them some money to fuel the car and also know how far they had gone but he wasn t picking his calls. They both contributed what they had and bought fuel. Since there was a lot of jam, we chose to drive through Kyambogo University so that we could connect through the other gate so that we could join them since they had told us that they could branch off from Jinja Road and head towards Kyambogo side. But shortly after exiting, we met a scuffle-like scene where two police officers stood by the roadside wielding guns. The bullion van and a Toyota Premio was also parked by the side. We drove off and I got out from around Nakawa while Badru remained with the car. I headed to my place in Mutungo,  Mr Wabuyi recollected.However, the following day, Mr Wabuyi says men dressed like civilians came to his workstation, asked him a few details before handcuffing him and taking him to ISO offices. For the last one month, he has been detained at ISO but says his family is aware. Asked why he and his colleague didn t stop after seeing a bullion van and a Toyota Premio which their colleagues travelled in parked by the side, he went mute.  He said he later learnt through the press that Bright and another man had been gunned down during a scuffle with security personnel at the scene while the rest fled.How security foiled robberyAn ISO official, who was privy to the operations that foiled the robbery but preferred anonymity, told journalists at ISO offices that they learnt of the deal from the very time it was being hatched.The officer said the late Bright Turyatunga, who was one of the architects of the deal, had confided in an officer in another security agency to join them but he rejected the risky deal. It is this officer that intimated to us and we started tracking them right from the first meeting. We kept monitoring their movements until we foiled the deal,  he said.The officer said the bullion driver and the other people involved in the mission are still on the run while two suspects are in custody. He dismissed Mr Wabuyi s claim that he wasn t at the scene. However, he suspected the entire deal was planned with the help of bank officials. Banks are supposed to have a tracking system to monitor movement of the bullion van.  Last month, ISO said the money in the van was Shs2.4b but noted that Shs617m had been stolen by the thugs.

53,"My Easter concerts are on, says Bobi Wine - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, has said he will go ahead to hold his Easter music shows even if police have not responded to his notification he sent to them more than a month ago. Mr Kyagulanyi said he notified police in time to deny them the legroom to have excuses of not being notified as it has been the norm on several occasions when they blocked his shows. I hope the whole world is following. We notified police about six weeks ago and they are pretending to come out to say we did not write to them in time. We shall hold that concert with or without their reply,  he said. Police did not come clean on whether they had received Bobi s letter of notification or not as the deputy police spokesperson, Ms Polly Namaye, referred us to Kampala Metropolitan Police to comment on the matter.  This matter should be handled by the police spokesperson,  she said. Mr Patrick Onyango, the spokesperson for Kampala Metropolitan Region, said:  If they have referred you to us, let me check if there is a letter to that effect   According to schedule, Bobi Wine is expected to hold his concerts at One Love Beach in Busabala in Wakiso District on Easter Monday. He will then perform in Lira on May 3, Arua on May 4 and Gulu on May 5. Many times in the past, Police have banned or blocked Bobi Wine s concerts claiming he has not notified them in writing or had informed them late and they had not authorised the shows.Last year, police accused Bobi Wine of failing to notify them in time and closed his show on Boxing Day at the last minute. The same show had been previously blocked at Mandela National Stadium with claims the stadium had been earlier booked for a wedding function.In 2018, Bobi Wine s show that was meant to take place in Bukoto in Kampala was also blocked at the last moment. Meanwhile, yesterday, event organisers and promoters met President Museveni at State House in Entebbe to be compensated for the losses incurred in the previous events which were cancelled. The promoters had earlier appealed to President Museveni, who later promised them Shs1 billion but they have only received Shs200m. The lawAct. Section 5 of the Public Order Management Act says:  An organiser shall give notice in writing signed by the organiser or his or her agent to the authority officer of the intention to hold a public meeting, at least three days but not more than 15 days before the proposed date of the public meeting. It s reinforced by Section 6 which states:  Upon receipt of a notice under section 5, where it is not possible to hold the proposed public meeting for some reasons; the authority shall, in writing within 48 hours after receipt of the notification, notify the organiser or his or her agent that it is not possible to hold the proposed public meeting and the notice shall be delivered to the organiser s address as the notice of intention to hold a public address.
