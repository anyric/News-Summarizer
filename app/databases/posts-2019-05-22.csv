0,S.Africa's parliament set to elect Ramaphosa president - Daily Monitor,"South African lawmakers were set to re-elect Cyril Ramaphosa as the nation's president on Wednesday, two weeks after the ANC returned to power in legislative elections.MPs from the African National Congress, which won 230 out of 400 seats on May 8, will choose the head of state in the parliament's first post-election sitting.The ANC won the ballot with 57.5 percent of the vote, its thinnest majority since the end of apartheid.Lawmakers were sworn in before the maiden session starting at 2.00 p.m. (1200 GMT).The next president will be sworn in on Saturday and name a deputy president and cabinet at the weekend.Under South Africa's 1996 constitution, electors vote for a party, and the party selects individuals who go to the National Assembly, which then chooses the head of state.Ramaphosa, 66, is a trade unionist who played a prominent part in the struggle against white minority rule before becoming a successful business after the end of apartheid.He will be serving his first full five-year term since taking over last year from Jacob Zuma who was forced out over a series of corruption scandals.Ramaphosa's first test as he starts his new term will be his choice of a cabinet -- a task beset by rival factions within the ANC.- Shadow of scandals -Prospects of a major reshuffle were heightened hours before Ramaphosa's expected return to office, when Deputy President David Mabuza announced he would defer taking his oath as a lawmaker.In a report, the ANC's integrity commission alleged Mabuza -- the party's No. 2 -- ""prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organisation into disrepute"".His name has repeatedly come up in media reports for corruption and political killings, when he was premier of the eastern Mpumalanga province before becoming vice president last year.He became the ANC's vice president in December 2017 when Ramaphosa was elected party leader. ""We have accepted and agreed to a request by the deputy president... to postpone his swearing-in,"" party spokesman Zizi Kodwa said on local TV news channel ENCA.Kodwa said it was not a given that Mabuza, as the party's vice president, would become the nation's deputy president.""The fact that he is deputy president of the ANC is not a guarantee or guarantor of a position of the deputy president of the republic,"" said Kodwa. Another senior ANC official, outgoing environment minister Nomvula Mokonyane, who has been named in the ongoing judicial inquiry into state corruption, has also pulled out and will not be an MP.The main opposition Democratic Alliance's chief whip in parliament, John Steenhuisen said the last-minute withdrawal by two senior ANC members is ""very clearly a sign that something is afoot in the ANC"".""It is completely bizarre ...and telling the divisions that exist within the governing party are continuing to exist and we are seeing manifestations of the various factions now playing out,"" said Steenhuisen.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/SouthAfrica-parliament-Ramaphosa-president--election/688340-5126826-oopqhu/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post0.png

Never, mum. I did not trust you, mum. And. I. Pulled air hard and balled it down into my navel, and let it out slow and firm, clean and without bumps out of my mouth, loud and clear over a shoulder, into her ear.  I am a homosexual, mum.

4,Parliament approves more Shs17b for Museveni country tours - Daily Monitor,"Parliament. Parliament has approved Shs33 billion as additional budget for State House to run President Museveni s activities about four weeks to the end of the financial year. The budget includes Shs17.6 billion for Mr Museveni s ongoing field tours countrywide, which he says are for sensitising the public on poverty alleviation and Shs15.7b for classified expenditure. The supplementary request dated May 17 was yesterday tabled before Parliament s before the Budget Committee yesterday by Minister of State for Planning David Bahati.According the documents tabled in Parliament, the money will be used for transporting, feeding and accommodating the President and his entourage.Finance minister Matia Kasaija said:  He has to fly; there are cars following him, then the advance team, so it is not cheap,  he said. The approval was done amid objections from the Opposition who claimed the President wants the money for early campaigns.MPs Muwanga Kivumbi and Cecilia Ogwal opposed the expenditure, claiming the President s field operations should be funded by his NRM party since he is engaging in early election campaigns.  You have to advise the President that if he is going for a nationwide campaign he should avoid NRM politics,  Ms Ogwal said. In all the regions Mr Museveni has visited, he has been endorsed as the NRM sole candidate.He has toured West Nile, Bunyoro, Tooro and northern Uganda where he has commissioned roads and addressed public rallies in the last three weeks. In 2018/2019 financial year, the President was given Shs249b for field operations.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Parliament-approves-more-Shs17b-Museveni-country-tours/688334-5125928-k7h2ouz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post4.png
5,Traffic diverted as construction of  Kampala Flyover starts - Daily Monitor,"Traffic at Shoprite and Clock Tower junctions will be temporarily diverted as the construction of the Kampala Flyover Construction and Road Upgrading project (KFCRUP) starts.The project is a joint venture between Shimizu Corporation and Konoike Construction Company Ltd.Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) officials on Tuesday issued a statement announcing what they termed as  temporary diversion of traffic  around Clock Tower and Shoprite junction also known as Queens Way junction and Nsambya Road.  They, however, clarified that this is not total road closure but rather diverting traffic to one lane instead of the current two lanes being used. UNRA officials say, as construction starts, motorists as well as cyclists should expect delays because of the traffic jam in the affected areas especially during rush hours.However, the affected roads will be closed for 24 hours from Wednesday May 15 to Friday June 12 2019.A schedule for temporary traffic diversion states that Nsambya road will be jammed for 10 days, Queens Way will be for 10 days while the jam at Clock Tower and Shoprite Junction will persist for  20 days. This implies that Kampala-bound traffic (Nsambya to Kampala) shall use the lane on the extreme left. This will also apply to  Nsambya bound travellers (Kampala to Nsambya)/Kibuli traffic who will use the lane on the extreme left.Entebbe-bound traffic (Kampala to Entebbe) will also use the lane to extreme left.  We urge road users to take note of the above schedule and adjust accordingly,  a UNRA statement reads in part.  We deeply regret the inconveniences caused and look forward to your understanding and good cooperation.  The Kampala Flyover Road Project is a road-improvement project in the Central Division of Kampala.BackgroundThe flyover project will be executed in phases. Phase 2 will be on Jinja Road near the Centenary Park and Wampewo Roundabout.  JICA will also fund it. The tendering of the design for the second phase will be announced next year. Phase two is expected to cost Shs659 billion.JICA conceived the flyover project eight years ago after commissioning studies to explore options for alleviating chronic traffic jams around the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area. The flyovers are also expected to connect outwards to the proposed Kampala-Jinja and Kampala-Mpigi Expressways.The government and Japanese government signed a loan for the flyover project in 2015.

6,Museveni okays Shs35b for parties - Daily Monitor,"ENTEBBE. President Museveni has granted a request by political parties seeking government to increase funding to them from Shs10b to Shs35b annually. The money is meant to cover the political parties  administrative costs at both national and district offices.The President ordered Finance minister Matia Kasaija to find the extra Shs25b, which should be included in the Budget for the 2019/20 financial year, which begins in July.The increased funding was one of the resolutions reached during closed-door proceedings of the Interparty Organisation for Dialogue (IPOD) Summit at State House Entebbe on Monday. The IPOD Summit comprises five political parties, which have representation in Parliament. They are the ruling NRM, the Democratic Party (DP), Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC), Justice Forum (JEEMA) and the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC). The State House summit on Monday was attended by the NRM chairperson, Mr Museveni, DP president-general Norbert Mao, UPC president James Akena, and Mr Muhammad Kibirige Mayanja, who represented Jeema party president Asuman Basalirwa. FDC boycotted the dialogue.Sources in the closed-door summit revealed to Daily Monitor that when the agenda of financing political parties was read out by Mr Mao, Mr Museveni showed no objection but disagreed with the IPOD Council on how the money should be spent.Sources said the President opposed the plan to allocate 20 per cent of the money to the IPOD Secretariat and share the balance equally among the parties. Sources said Mr Museveni instead guided that 40 per cent be used on administration of parties, including paying salaries of staff, 15 per cent goes to IPOD and the rest be spent on running parties  activities. The Shs35b will be shared by political parties in accordance with their respective numerical strength in Parliament.Mr Kasaija, who was in attendance, reportedly told the President that  it could not be possible  to have the money in the new financial year budget because allocations had already been completed. However, sources said Mr Museveni ordered the minister to find the money by whatever means to avoid conflicts in the parties that might breed violence. The minister of Finance was crying  there is no money  but after the President ordered him to find the money, he said  let me go and look around ,  a source said.During the summit, Mr Museveni reportedly also agreed to the proposal to amend the Public Order Management Act (POMA), which the Opposition said is being used by police to block their meetings. The political parties were concerned about Section 5 of the Act, which provides that the Inspector General of Police shall be notified about a public meeting or gathering by anyone or political group organising such a meeting at least three days before or not more than 15 days before the proposed date.Museveni on Bobi, BesigyeSources said much as the President agreed to the proposed amendments tabled in Parliament for approval, he insisted that former FDC presidential candidate Kizza Besigye and Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, alias Bobi Wine, will still be blocked by police from traversing the country because they do not have the legitimacy to carry out national mobilisation of the masses.Sources said the President argued that Dr Besigye and Mr Bobi Wine do not have  legitimate positions  in political parties. He said Dr Besigye does not occupy any defined position in the FDC hierarchy whereas Mr Bobi Wine is an MP whose operation should be restricted to his constituency.  What is their identity  We are discussing political party issues. If you are a party president or secretary general you should not be blocked from mobilisation,  the President reportedly said.He was responding to a concern by Mr Mayanja on why Bobi Wine and Dr Besigye were being blocked by police from meeting the people.Mr Museveni reportedly said Secretaries General should be allowed to do mobilisation for their respective political parties countrywide. However, the President s justification for blocking Dr Besigye and Bobi Wine does not explain why the police have been blocking rallies and meetings organised by Mr Patrick Amuriat Oboi, who is the FDC president. In his speech after the IPOD summit, Mr Mayanja said he was not satisfied with the President s explanation about the security agencies blocking Bobi Wine s music concerts.What people power, FDC sayMs Ingrid Turinawe yesterday said there is no way Dr Besigye, an FDC card holder, can be barred from being deployed by his party president to move around the country on any errand.  Mr Museveni should know that Dr Besigye is a Ugandan who won the 2016 elections but he overthrew him by sending him to prison. We will not allow Mr Museveni to tell us who should be deployed and who should not,  she said.The spokesperson of Bobi Wine s People Power political pressure group, Mr Joel Ssenyonyi, described the President s stance as someone fearing politicians who do not have identity.  Our President always fumbles with matters of law. Now, which law was he quoting here  If Hon Kyagulanyi has no political identity, why is he so scared of him   he said.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Museveni-okays-Shs35b-parties/688334-5125902-13ixsxdz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post6.png
7,Cabinet elevates 15 municipalities to cities - Daily Monitor,"KAMPALA. The first five of the 15 cities that the Cabinet approved on Monday will start operations in July 2020, Ministry of Local Government has confirmed.  We have set aside a budget of Shs130b to operationalise [to make operational] the cities, with the first lot starting operations in July 2020,  Col Tom Butime, the minister of Local Government, said yesterday.The first lot has Arua, Gulu, Jinja, Fort Portal and Mbarara. In the second cohort, Hoima and Mbale will be elevated in 2021, while Lira and Entebbe will be in the third lot of the elevation. Others are Nakasongola, Moroto, Masaka, Soroti, Kabale and Wakiso. While presenting the list of the cities yesterday, Col Butime said all the cities will be managed by the Ministry of Local Government. Col Butime said the nine municipalities meet all the minimum requirements to be elevated to a city status, and will be upgraded in phases.  As part of the overall effort to fast track Uganda into middle income status government has approved creation of 15 cities and their operationalisation is phased. Arua, Mbarara, Fort Portal and Gulu will start operations in July 2020, Hoima and Mbale will start in 2021, while Lira and Entebbe will come on board in 2022. Nakasongola, Moroto, Masaka, Soroti, Kabale and Wakiso will start operations in 2023,  Col Butime said.He said the ministry is now developing guidelines for the operations of the approved cities. According to him, the guidelines will help in running the administration of the cities. We shall sit down and give guidelines to these new cities on how they are going to operate because the only city we have is Kampala, which is a central government city. There has never been a city which is local government. Now there are going to be cities as local governments so we need to have very clear guidelines of operations,  he said.Election of Members of ParliamentAccording to the directive from the Local Government, each city will have three MPs. Two will represent the divisions within the cities and one Woman MP, just like the district representatives.Col Butime said the creation of the cities will not eliminate the districts, adding that the original districts would remain intact, while the cities will have their own administrative units.For example, initially, the entire Arua District had passed a resolution to become part of Arua city. However, later, Vurra County decided that they would not be part of the district, but would opt to be a district of their own. If the decision goes through, Arua District will cease to exist, metamorphosing into Arua City.The minister said a city like Arua will have one representative for Arua Central, which is the current municipality, and another one representing Ayivu Division. We have divided them into two divisions, each division will have an MP, and just like the district, the third MP will be the Woman MP, to add the numbers to three,  he said.He said all the new municipalities will have equal numbers of legislators to represent them.On the boundary issues, Col Butime said all the issues regarding the boundaries between the divisions, cities and the mother districts have already been resolved. He said prior to presenting the list of the cities to the Cabinet for approval, the commissioner for urban development was tasked to ensure that the issues are resolved and presented a clean bill of health. You know before we went to the Cabinet, the commissioner for urban administration went back to all those proposed cities and made sure that there was no debate or quarrel over those boundaries. As I talk now, we were in Cabinet last night, there was no misunderstanding over the boundaries, it is very clear. We made sure there was no going back to mark the boundaries of those divisions of the cities,  he said.Other administrative unitsThe minister also said a number of other administrative units have also been created to create closer service delivery points to the people. He said over the last three years, government has operationalised the creation of 23 districts that were approved before the 2016 elections. The remaining districts that did not start operations will effective July 1, this year become districts. They include; Rwampara, Karenga, Obongi, Kalaki, Kitagwenda, Kazo and Madi Okollo districts. Terego District will start operations in 2020, according to the minister.The minister said overall, the ministry has completed 62 per cent of the manifesto promises and is on course to score 100 per cent by the end of this year, or early next year. To this end, the ministry has already realised 62 per cent of the manifesto commitments and remains committed to achieving 100 per cent by completing construction of markets, improving staff levels, conducive environment and scaling up resources transferred to the local governments,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Cabinet-elevates-15-municipalities-cities/688334-5125824-5h8yw4z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post7.png
8,AAR clinics reopen as doctors call off strike - Daily Monitor,"Private clinics under Africa Air Rescue (AAR) Healthcare Uganda resumed operations yesterday after the management heeded to the striking doctors  demands for salary enhancement.Eight of the 11 AAR private clinics closed last Friday after doctors laid down their tools, protesting low pay compared to their counterparts in other private and public hospitals.Following a meeting with management on Monday, the doctors agreed to return to work.  The purpose of this collective agreement between the employer and the employee is to mutually agree on satisfactory working relations between the employer and its employees, establish and maintain its rates of pay and conditions of employment, to provide appropriate procedures for prompt resolution of grievances and problems and to recognise the mutual value of joint discussion, consultation and negotiation,  the collective agreement between both parties reads in part. The doctors, who receive between Shs1.9m and Shs2.1m net salary were demanding at least Shs3m net salary, while the part-time doctors wanted their current pay of Shs12,000 per hour revised to Shs15,000 per hour.Under the collective agreement, entry salary for doctors shall be gross of Shs3.8m and net of Shs2.5m. On the other hand, management agreed to pay part time doctors Shs13,000 per hour and specialised doctors will be paid 50 per cent of the consultation fees in line with the respective insurance companies. Although salary adjustments are slightly lower than the earlier demands, one of the doctors said they accepted the terms to allow services to resume as talks with management for better working conditions continue.  For me it was not even about the salary increment alone but even the way things are handled such as threatening doctors whenever they demand for better terms,  said the doctor who did not want to disclose his identity.Mr Indren Pooven, the AAR chief executive director, said on Sunday that they had taken long to adjust the staff salaries because the Group s board needed more information before the approval. AAR Healthcare Uganda Limited is a subsidiary of AAR Healthcare Holdings Limited operating in East Africa.The doctors had also complained that the Shs15,000 given to specialists per patient is too little compared to the Shs50,000-Shs80,000 paid by patients.

9,"Uganda needs 5,000 pharmacists - experts - Daily Monitor","Uganda needs at least 5,000 pharmacists for both the private and government sectors to effectively serve the population, experts have said. This was revealed in Kampala yesterday during the launch of the 8th convention for pharmacy students that will be held in July.Dr Samuel Opio, the secretary Pharmaceutical Society of Uganda, said currently, Uganda has 1,100 registered and licensed pharmacists but about 20 per cent of them are out of the country for further studies or work. We need to increase five times more because only 150 pharmacists graduate annually and we need to increase the number to 600 to be able to cover the gap in 10 years to come,  he said.Brain drainDr Opio added that of the registered pharmacists, 90 per cent are employed in the private sector. This means that access to the pharmacists is still a problem for Ugandans who are using public sector facilities, especially in remote areas. That is why they end up having individual treatment,  he said.Dr Opio added that the public should also change the perception that pharmacists are drug sellers yet they are experts in medicine.  Currently, there is a need to have more veterinary pharmacists because screening of animal products is becoming a problem in Uganda and it is meant to be done by these pharmacists,  he said. Dr Opio also revealed that they have developed a mobile application that will help improve pharmaceutical services across the county. This application will be used by the pharmacists and their employers. It is currently on trial for the whole of this month after which we expect to launch it,  he said. Mr Morris Seru, the acting commissioner for pharmaceuticals in the Ministry of Health, said that government is not in position to employ all the pharmacists needed in the country. As government, we know where we need pharmacists and we are working to make sure that we have them but some will be hired by private sectors,  he said. Mr Seru added that they want a pharmacist for every district. We are working with the human resource department because district health officers are over loaded and these pharmacists will be responsible to support in pharmaceutical services right from health centre II. We need one pharmacist per 10 people, which means we still have a gap of 4,000 pharmacists,  he said.

10,Oulanyah slams Finance for messing up budget process - Daily Monitor,"Parliament. The Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Mr Jacob Oulanyah, has castigated the Finance ministers for frustrating Parliament s efforts to conclude the budget process by introducing new additions late. These are documents that should have come to Parliament on or by April 1  Today is May 21. It is not fair to Parliament, it is not   Mr Oulanyah said. The budget amendment, technically cited as an addendum, refers to the additional Shs1 trillion by government, which will see the National Budget rise to Shs40.5 trillion.Mr Oulanyah made the stinging remarks yesterday while presiding over the House sitting, during which Mr David Bahati, the Minister of State for Planning, presented an amendment to the Financial Year 2019/20 Budget, hours before Parliament was expecting to make final changes and debate on the same.Kasaija muteFinance minister Kasaija was quietly seated next to Mr Bahati, sternly staring at the Speaker. I am hoping that the Budget Committee has already accessed this document because if it is coming up for the first time, Honourable minister, you know what you have done to us,  Mr Oulanyah mused.Mr Bahati quickly responded, saying the Budget Committee had received an advance copy of the amendment containing the additional Shs1 trillion, but had to wait for the addendum to be officially laid before Parliament.Butambala County MP Muhammad Muwanga Kivumbi drew the Speaker s attention to the law, saying the amendment was only being stampeded without scrutiny by the responsible committees, yet the deadline for passing the budget was fast approaching.Parliament is expected to debate and pass the budget not later than May 30. Mr Kivumbi cited the Shs105b request for Uganda Revenue Authority meant for digital stamps. An item of that nature has to be looked at by the sectorial committee but if you are to push it there, we cannot beat the deadline,  he said.He added:  In the Budget Committee, we do not have the requisite knowledge and skill to retrospect that item, we are constrained and Finance should be restrained from going forward to lay this kind of addendum. The MP implored the Deputy Speaker to tell the truth to authorities in the Ministry of Finance, whose operations, he said,  make Parliament s work look shabby. Mr Oulanyah said the ministers were acting unfairly to Parliament by submitting fresh additions to the budget only a few days to final appropriation.He told Mr Kasaija:   you are about to be guilty of financial indiscipline. However, when he took to the floor, Mr Kasaija said them [Finance], were there to serve the country and the sectors would come with something that is extremely urgent.He was ruled out of order, this time with the Speaker making clear emphasis on mandate, law and timelines in a more severe tone.  You see, some of us may be here to serve the country but a lot more people and these MPs here are part of them who are determined to serve their country   Mr Oulanyah charged at Mr Kasaija.He added:  Yours is a wish and desire that you can do but for us we want to serve this country; committed, determined that this country should be served but by your methods of work, you don t seem to be portraying what you seem to believe. He emphasised that with a law in place,  any agency that does not follow that timeline should not mess anybody else apart from itself. The additional of Shs1 trillion was referred to the Budget Committee for possible consideration only if resources allow. The Budget Committee has up to tomorrow to present its report to Parliament.BackgroundThe changes. Finance minister Matia Kasaija in the addendum has made fresh alterations to the main Budget, suggesting new requirements that lead to a rise in the earlier proposed funds. One of the items included is a Shs105b request for a digital stamp and e-system for the Uganda Revenue Authority.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Oulanyah-slams-Finance-messing-up-budget-process/688334-5125872-b2b1ocz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post10.png
11,Africa's dilemma in the face of imminent global shocks - Daily Monitor,"The future is no longer is as predictable as it used to be. Weather and climate change trends pose huge challenges. Principles of democracy are being put to test in the very nations that birthed and emphasized the same principles over the years. Even academic concepts such as the law of demand and supply are being stretched in the face of increasing reliance on software driven production and supply channels. The need to employ a futuristic approach to managing all human occupations needs no emphasis in view of such uncertainty. Globally, the future promises to be laden with disconcerting surprises. The World Economic Forum produces an annual global risks report which is a good log of evolving trends in the shocks that prevail in our times. Their 2018 edition highlights developments that should interest Africa. Among other global threats, it highlights that political commitment to globalization has since weakened in the wake of the global financial crisis and this threatens global trade as a result of bilateral trade wars that can easily cascade. Today, there are deeper protectionist tendencies all over the world. The global trade system is threatened.Africa being the poorest continent must quickly devise means to address the danger arising from this and The African Continental Free Trade Area initiative being pursued currently is an excellent step in the right direction. Unfortunately though, there appears to be lack of appreciation of the urgency required to consolidate this initiative. By mid-May 2019, out of 55 countries, 3 had not signed the relevant agreement at all whereas only 20 countries had proceeded to ratify it after signing. Nigeria, the largest economy on the continent, is among the 3 countries that had not signed it, along with Eritrea and Benin. Protectionism is rife on the continent, the prevailing poverty and trailing position of the continent on the global wealth scale notwithstanding. African countries seem not to realize that their dismal economies have nothing to benefit from continuing to play in isolation, or that indeed even the biggest amongst them are endangered. Our isolated economies are too weak to wield any favorable influence for themselves on the international stage and will continue to be taken advantage of, in a global market space that is turning into a jungle.Equally important is the revelation that the world faces danger of simultaneous failure of breadbaskets facilitated by disruptors such as extreme weather, political instability or crop diseases. All these disrupting factors are prominent for Africa. For example, the continent is almost entirely unprepared for extreme weather events. According to FAO, only an average 7% of arable land in Africa was under irrigation by 2015, with the scale for Sub-Saharan Africa tipping to an even a smaller 4%. The rest of the continent s farming activity runs on rain fed agriculture. Civil strife is also a common occurrence, and in many instances political conflicts have matured into prolonged wars as have been seen in Somalia, South Sudan, the Lake Chad Basin, DRC and Central African Republic, the Horn of Africa and Mali. Such conflicts can cripple food production. In foresight, continental leaders have taken steps to strengthen the food production chain, although again the intended measures to attain this have not been implemented. In 2003, African countries agreed under the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme to allocate at least 10 percent of public budgets to agriculture in order to achieve 6% growth in the sector. By 2010,seven years later, Sub-Saharan Africa was allocating only 3% of total expenditures on agriculture on average, and the entire continent was doing slightly better at 3.9%. With the highest population growth rate in the world and the related food need, this is a dire situation for Africa.It is unfortunate that even when obvious dangers have been identified and solutions devised, the continent procrastinates along the solutions paths. We are positioning our descendants for peril.Prominent also among other global dangers is the increasing tendency towards war without rules manifesting especially in form of cyber-attacks, even between super powers. The growing disregard for conventional war, with agreed norms and protocols, should concern Africa because it is an indicator of potential reckless attacks by super powers of weaker nations in future, even in form of physical aggression. Africa in the current state, of isolated countries, is too weak to protect itself from such trends. Perhaps the continent should be considering unity beyond trade as well.The writer is a Chartered Risk Analyst and risk management consultant[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Africa-dilemma-global-shocks-supply-channels-Nigeria/688334-5125068-xrgs5e/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post11.png
12,Farmers protest verification of seedlings supplied by government - Daily Monitor,"BUHWEJU/KANUNGU/NTUNGAMO/RUKUNGIRI.  Farmers under their umbrella body of Tea Nursery Bed Operators and Growers Association, led by Mr Frank Byaruhanga, have protested a repeated verification exercise of tea seedlings done by Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Operation Wealth Creation (OWC) and National Agriculture and Advisory Services (Naads). Those who were verifying worked with the District Internal Security Officer and Gombolola Internal Security Officers forced themselves into the fields, the political and other leaders never participated,  Mr Byaruhanga, who is also the LC5 councillor for Mpungu Sub-county in Kanungu, said.He said on Monday that it was not proper for Naads to repeat the verification exercise knowing that some of the seedlings were destroyed by the drought that hit the country in 2017.Officials had concluded the verification exercise of seedlings supplied in Buhweju, Ntungamo, Kanungu and Rukungiri districts in 2016 and 2017 under delegated procurement.The verification exercise took 19 days and ended on Sunday. The aim was to establish the existence of both beneficiaries and nursery bed operators (suppliers), who claim to have delivered seedlings to farmers in four districts for which they demand about Shs20 billion from government. The verification exercise has ended, the team is going come out with a final report,  OWC programme spokesperson, Maj Tabaro Kiconco, said on Monday.He added:  This exercise will help to weed out ghost claimants, and the fraudsters. It was intended to establish the acreage of the tea fields and traceability of the tea distributed under OWC programme.  Otherwise the tea enterprise is taking shape with demands of more factories from farmers in Ntungamo and Buhweju districts. One team worked in Kanungu and Rukungiri while another worked in Ntungamo and Buhweju. They conducted physical garden visits to verify planted seedlings and used Global Positioning System to determine the planted area. Similar exerciseHowever, a similar verification was done in the districts of Kabale, Mitooma, Rubirizi, Bushenyi, Isingiro, Sheema, Rukiga, Rubanda, Mbarara and Kisoro last year.Maj Tabaro said details of the findings will be in the final report.Another official who was on the verification team, said Rukungiri and Kanungu districts have less than 50 per cent of the tea claimed to have been supplied in the period.Naads gave the districts the mandate of procuring suppliers of tea seedlings (delegated procurement).Districts were supposed to identify nursery bed operators, contract them to supply tea to farmers and verify the tea before Naads pays them. However, Kanungu District executive members were opposed to the verification exercise. They placed announcements on radios urging the farmers not to cooperate with the verification team. Ms Josephine Kasya, the LC5 chairperson, argued that the verification exercise was done earlier and Naads had declined to pay the suppliers. She said they had to sue Naads in the Commercial Court in Kampala in July 2018 over the loss. We were surprised on April 29, when the officials from the Naads secretariat stormed the district saying they wanted to re-do verification exercise of the planted tea seedlings. We told them that we cannot repeat the exercise because the resolution at the mediation meeting was that Naads pays those who supplied seedlings.Now that Naads secretariat has opted to breach the mediation resolutions, let the courts of law take over the matter and decide,  Ms Kasya said while addressing farmers at the district headquarters on May 2.Dr Christopher Bukenya, the head of technical services at the Naads Secretariat, said he had not been briefed by the head of the verification team led by Mr Everest Mulumba.He, however, added that the findings from the exercise will guide government in paying those who supplied tea seedlings in the tea growing districts in South-Western Uganda.By  certain circumstances  Dr Bukenya was denoting the fact that suppliers did not have formal contracts with Naads. He added:  We were guided that despite the circumstances, we need to verify the tea that was planted, we are trying to correct something that went wrong. He said though the report has not been compiled, payments will be a process and will still depend on the success of the exercise. Dr Bukenya added that those who sued Naads might have made an error because they were not duly contracted to supply government.However, Mr Byaruhanga said independent districts were delegated to handle tea procurement starting from 2008. He said the farmers had by 2015 grown tea and when leaders and tea stakeholders from South-Western met the President in Gulu the same year, it was agreed that Kanungu, Kisoro, Kabale, Rukungiri, Isingiro and Ntungamo districts get tea factories. The President promised that government will allocate Shs220 billion for procurement of tea seedlings to be released in two financial years of 2015/2016 and 2016/2017,  Mr Byaruhanga added.Failure in paymentSome of the seedlings lost value from nursery beds and while some of those planted got destroyed by the 2017 drought, Naads could not verify and pay for them.After several efforts to get paid money they injected in the project failed, 717 nursery bed operators (from all tea growing districts in South-Western), in 2018, took Naads to court. Mr Byaruhanga said the matter is in court and the verification exercise was contempt of court.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Farmers-protest-verification-seedlings-supplied-government/688334-5125660-102liauz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post15.png
13,Potholes eat up Lira access road - Daily Monitor,"LIRA. Road users have expressed concern over the poor state of Olwol Road in Lira Town. Potholes are gradually eating away the busy road that stretches from All Nations Corner connecting Kwania Road via Lira Bus Park.Residents claim the potholes that have peppered most portion of the road, have made the Olwol Road almost impassable. The road is key because it serves motorists and passengers travelling from within Lira Municipality and the neighbouring districts such as Alebtong, Abim and Otuke to access Lira Bus Park. Mr Walter Okello, a boda boda rider, said several accidents have occurred on Olwol Road.  Just last week, a pregnant woman who was riding on a bicycle fell down after hitting a pothole,  he said. A motorcycle mechanic, Mr Benson Okullu, said the road is in a sorry state and that those using it are at risk.District leaders have, however, said the World Bank has approved additional funding for road construction in Lira Town under the Uganda Support to Municipal Infrastructure Development (USMID) project. The acting municipal engineer, Mr Freddie Owiny, recently said plans were underway to develop and design Boundary, Obangakene, Independence, Lumumba-Ogengo, Jackson Oyuku, Ayer and Teso Bar roads in 2018/2019 financial year. So far, Obote Avenue, Oyam, Oyite Ojok Lane, Aroma Lane and Rwot Aler roads have been constructed, he said, adding that engineering design of Boundary, Olwol, Obangakene and Noteber roads has also been done with support from USMID.  We are fully committed to doing our best, both as technical officers and political leaders of the municipality and are determined to change the face of Lira for the better without fear or favour,  Mr Mike Ogwang Olwa- Veve, the Lira mayor, said.On May 17, President Yoweri Museveni commissioned Obote Avenue, one of the three roads constructed in Lira Town central business district under USMID. The other roads are Soroti and Kwania roads. The three roads measuring 2.8 kilometres were constructed at a cost of Shs21.4 billion. Town clerk Assy Abirebe recently told this newspaper that Lira Municipal Council had received Shs55 billion from the World Bank to fund the construction of 12 roads in the area. The roads to be constructed in this three under USMID s infrastructural development plan are the Boundary, Olwol, Obangakene, Note Ber, Oyam, Wonyaci, Ojwang Opota, Ogwang Edola, Agoro, Ayer, Teso Bar/ Corner Kamdini, Post Office, Bala, Aputi and Inomo.The project USMID, which was first launched in 2013, currently enhances the institutional performance of 14 municipal local governments countrywide, to improve urban service delivery. The beneficiary municipalities are Lira, Gulu, Soroti, Arua, Mbale, Jinja, Mbarara, Masaka, Entebbe, Fort Portal, Kabale, Moroto, Tororo and Hoima. The six-year project is expected to expand urban infrastructure and enhance the capacity of the 14 beneficiary municipalities to generate own revenues, improve urban planning, and strengthen financial management, procurement, environmental and social systems.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Potholes-eat-up-Lira-access-road/688334-5125686-n5wibtz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post16.png
14,New Mubende-Kagadi road boosts business - Daily Monitor,"KAKUMIRO/KAGADI. Residents of Kakumiro and Kagadi cannot hold their joy as construction of the Mubende-Kakumiro-Kagadi road takes shape.A section of residents have now put up roadside markets on the already completed section of the road to tap into business opportunities through selling their merchandise.The residents, mostly farmers, are selling different foodstuffs to the people driving on the new road, which had over the years been shunned by motorists because of its sorry state.The 104km road is being constructed by China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) at a cost of more than Shs480 billion.About 45kms of the road have already been completed, to the excitement of people who usually travel from Mubende to Kakumiro, Kibaale and Kagadi districts.Now, with the completed section lying between Kibaale Town in Kibaale District to Kibambula Trading Centre in Kakumiro District, foodstuffs such as bananas (matooke), beans, cassava and fruits are displayed on stalls all day long.Others are assembling charcoal bags beside the road to tap into opportunities coming with increased traffic on the road.Mr Gerald Turinawe, a resident of Kasongoire in Matale Sub-county, Kibaale District, is among the dozens of people who vend matooke at Busesa Trading Centre.   The road has already started helping us because as you can see, the place is like a full market. You cannot come here with matooke and fail to get customers. We are surviving on this roadside market,  Mr Turinawe said.He said with the proceeds from the roadside sale of matooke, he will increase the size of his banana plantation before venturing into vegetable gardens.Away from the roadside markets, the new road has led to the rapid increase in value for land as people are set to tap into the available opportunities.Mr Denis Kugonza from Kasojo Trading Centre in Bwanswa Sub-county, Kibaale District, said the cost of a 50x100ft plot of land has doubled from Shs4m to Shs8m.  The coming of the tarmac has increased the price of land here. All people want to build on the main road and that has increased the value,  he said.The Kakumiro District secretary for works, transport and technical services, Mr Eriya Twebaze, said upon completion, the road will increase the local revenue base because of increased investments. BackgroundAdvice. President Museveni, during his recent tour of Bunyoro sub-region, encouraged the people in the area to use the oil roads being constructed to increase their household incomes. The roads are for all people but how are you going to use them  Here, people should look at wealth creation and skills specialisation. People should be in commercial agriculture, small scale factories, and services like catering, hair dressing and food processing, among others,  the President said.The President said oil roads such as Buhimba-Nalweyo-Igayaza-Kakumiro; Masindi-Biso; Kabaale-Kizirafumdi; Hohwa-Nyairongo-Kyarushesha-Butole; and Hoima- Butiaba -Wanseko, would be worked on.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/New-Mubende-Kagadi-road-boosts-business/688334-5125702-137kf5kz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post17.png
15,"Government to revamp Bukalasa College, says minister - Daily Monitor","LUWEERO. Government is set to revamp Bukalasa Agriculture College in order to produce better extensionists with hands-on skills, Agriculture minister Vincent Ssempijja, has said.The minister said the partnership between Uganda and donor agencies, including the twining up of Bukalasa Agriculture College with Dalhousie University from Canada to transform Bukalasa to a centre of agriculture excellence, is part of their commitment to ensure that the college produces extension staff with hands-on skills that match the modern farming practices targeting commercial agriculture in Uganda. Government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, is already undertaking several strategies to ensure that Bukalasa Agriculture College, now producing the bulk of the country s agriculture extension staff, gets the necessary assistance in terms of manpower, technology, among other logistical support, to boost the agriculture sector. The increasing challenges in the weather patterns and the need for a robust transformation from subsistence to commercial-oriented farming sector calls for strengthened skills training,  Mr Ssempijja told parents and graduands at the 55th Bukalasa Agriculture College graduation ceremony at the college campus in Luweero District on last Friday.GruaduandsA total of 1, 083 graduands were awarded diplomas and certificates after successfully completing their respective courses in agribusiness management, animal production and management, crop production and management, horticulture, human nutrition and dietetics, among others.The minister said government has also prioritised the boosting of the service sector within the Agriculture ministry by recruiting more extension staff to help the farmers adapt to modern farming practices, with emphasis on commercial agriculture.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-revamp-Bukalasa-College-minister/688334-5125708-xwpof8z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post18.png
16,Island residents can t wait for MV Sigulu to start work - Daily Monitor,"Namayingo.  Mr Morris Ojambo, a resident of Ndaiga Village in Bukane Sub-county in Namayingo District is still coping with the death of his wife, two years after. The 50-year-old breaks down as he narrates how his wife developed complications and bled to death while giving birth because there was no nearby health centre. I wanted to take her to a health centre across the mainland but I failed because I could not get affordable means of transport,  Mr Ojambo says. Many families here cannot afford to hire a boat in time to transport their sick relatives. As a result, we end up losing our beloved ones under our watch,  he adds.Hiring a boat from Lolwe Island to Busiro Landing Site in Banda Sub-county to access a health facility costs more than Shs400,000.However, Mr Ojambo is optimistic that the situation will change when the construction of Sigulu ferry at Masese Landing Site is complete.The MV Sigulu will connect Sigulu and Lolwe Islands to Lugala mainland. The ferry was contracted to JGH Marine A/S, a Danish firm. Ms Benedict Nangosia, the chairman of Buhone Village, where a dock is being built, says:  We are happy that finally, we are going to have a ferry in this area. The number of accidents will also reduce on the lake. In 2016, a boat from Bukana Island to Bumalenge Beach in Sigulu capsized, killing all the people on board.Mr Geoffrey Ouma, another resident, says the ferry will create job opportunities. We will get odd jobs such as loading cargo, and it will also promote investments,  he says.Mr Peter Okumu Wanda, the district speaker, says the ferry will also promote tourism between the main land and the islands. Dolwe has a huge potential for tourism, including the magnificent art rocks, the bird species, boat racing, water rafting, which have not been exploited and we hope business is going to develop rapidly,  Mr Okumu says.Mr Ronald Sanya, the district chairperson, says they have been having challenges of deploying staff, especially teachers and health workers in the area. Many of the district workers deployed to work in Bukhooli Islands have been turning down our requests because they fear travelling on small boats to distant places like Dolwe but now that the ferry is complete, we are going to see more teachers and medical staff deployed in the island. This will improve service delivery,  Mr Sanya says. Ms Joyce Nambozo, the chief administrative officer, says the ferry will transport expectant women to the mainlands. We have lost several mothers in the islands due to lack of transport because the family cannot afford to hire a boat,  Ms Nambozo said.Ferry to sail soonRecently, Ms Allen Kagina, the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) executive director, said construction works on the ferry were complete. Ms Kagina made the remarks while addressing project affected persons on the Majanji-Busia road.  This vessel is fitted with three engines, a 300-passenger seater space, huge cargo space and has most modern technology digital equipment to enable remote monitoring from Kampala, on engine performance, loading and location while sailing on water,  Ms Kagina, said. She said the construction cost about $4.3m (about Shs166b) and has been built to high standards to enable it have a high sea worthiness certificate. UNRA officials say the construction started in September last year and that the ferry has a load capacity of 300 tonnes.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Island-residents-can-t-wait-MV-Sigulu-start-work/688334-5125730-9h1ulw/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post19.png
17,Acholi clerics meet South Sudan rebel commanders - Daily Monitor,"Gulu. Clerics from Acholi Sub-region under their umbrella body Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative (ARLPI) have said their meeting with top South Sudanese rebel commanders will shape efforts made by other partners to end the conflict in the country.The meeting, coordinated by the UN Peace Office in Torit and Inter-religious Council of Eastern Equatoria State, was held in a rebel controlled territory in Torit county, Eastern Equatoria State last Friday.Retired Bishop Nelson Onono Onweng of Northern Uganda, also the ARLPI chairperson, told journalists in Gulu Town on Monday that they asked the rebel commanders to think of the consequences of the war and focus on the children and women who are largely being affected. We asked them whether they love their country and why they should be fighting again, we told them what we think would be better to stabilise their country and that would be cessation of hostility,  Bishop Onweng said.The prelates met the Sudan People s Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA/IO) top commanders, including Gen Justine Taban, the Eastern Equatoria State SPLA/IO commander.They visited the country on invitation of their counterparts, the Interreligious Council of Eastern Equatoria State on a benchmarking meeting themed  Amazing impact of unity of religious leaders. Bishop Onweng said they also held meetings with clerics from Eastern Equtoria State headed by Archbishop Bernard Oringa where they shared their experience in resolving wars.Sheikh Musa Khelil, the Acholi Muslim Khadi, said they urged the rebel commanders to keep their promises. We are impressed with declaration made by the rebel leaders not to go back to war again and cause any harm on the civilian population. We believe if they keep up to that promise, the conflict will end and South Sudan will become a better nation,  Sheikh Khelil said.Other officials on the Acholi team included Mr Francis Lukwiya, the ALRPI programme coordinator and Rev Patrick Lumumba from the Northern Uganda Diocese.BACKGROUNDLast year, South Sudan President Salva Kiir signed a peace deal with Dr Riek Machar, the SPLA-IO leader in an attempt to bring an end to the civil war. In April, Pope Francis kissed the feet of the two leaders and implored them to maintain peace that exists between them. Civil unrest broke up in South Sudan in 2013, following tension between forces loyal to President Kiir and Dr Machar.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Acholi-clerics-meet-South-Sudan-rebel-commanders/688334-5125738-11i94nl/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post20.png
18,Government in talks with Amin family over Arua airport expansion - Daily Monitor,"ARUA. The government is holding discussions with the family of former president Idi Amin to acquire large chunks of land for the expansion of Arua airport to international standards.Officials from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) say discussions have progressed well and they will soon enter an agreement.Mr Samuel Wonekha, the CAA general manager for regional airports, said he is hopeful that both parties will come to an agreeable position very soon. The issue of land in Arua; after we carried out the detailed master plan for the airport, the master plan dictated that some additional land must be acquired to implement the plan and we are actually looking for additional land,  said Mr Wonekha. Part of this land actually belongs to the former head of state. The family of late president Idi Amin own most of the land around the airport. We are moving on well with the talks and hope to secure this land very soon,  he added. CAA plansMr Wonekha said once the land is acquired, they will embark on the construction of the terminals and runways to accommodate different sizes of the planes. CAA wants to upgrade the airfield to Category 4C airport, which has field length of more than 1,800 metres.The category 4C airport can accommodate a plane of wing length of up to 24 metres. Arua airport currently has length of 1,800m, and officials from the CAA say the master plan demands that more land be availed to make the airport meet the required specifications.On delays to complete the compensation of those who own land near the airport, Mr Wonekha admitted that some rejected the initial government offer, while others have no letters of administration because the owners of the land died. In our report, we indicated that we have effected payment so far up to 98 per cent. For the 11 members, who have not been compensated yet, there are issues that range from the fact that the estates changed because people passed on and they are to secure letters of administration before their proper settlement. We also have people who objected to the value of their properties, which are under review by the government chief valuer and we are getting positive data from those affected and soon we are going to effect their payments,  he said. Mr Wonekha also said government is currently soliciting for $56m (Shs209.2b) for the general upgrading of the airport to meet the regional and international standards. He said the major works have been delayed because government has not secured the required funds. Government is still sourcing for financing of about $56m that will enable us to begin on the actual major project of upgrading the airport in Arua. However, the smaller components of the projects are ongoing but the major works will start when we receive the funding,  he said.Strategic position Arua is the second busiest domestic airport in the country after Entebbe, with a monthly average of 180 air traffic movements. Presently, Eagle Air operates scheduled flights with a 19- seater aircraft. Ad hoc and charter flights are also operated by Mission Aviation Fellowship, United Nations, AIM Air, Samaritan Purse and Kampala Aero Club and Flight Training Centre.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-talks-with-Amin-family-Arua-airport-expansion/688334-5123910-mcn44yz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post21.png
19,UPC to punish members for endorsing Museveni s sole candidature - Daily Monitor,"OYAM. The Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC) party has said it will discipline some of its members who recently endorsed President Museveni as the sole candidate for the 2021 presidential elections. On May 16, leaders of the Opposition Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and UPC in Lango sub-region reportedly seconded a resolution, endorsing Mr Museveni as the sole candidate for the forthcoming elections. When the President convened a meeting at Oyam Boma grounds for all the local leaders in Lango sub-region to deliver his message of wealth creation, the resolution to endorse him for 2021 was moved by NRM and seconded by FDC and UPC members. Mr Ogwal Ojok, the NRM chairperson for Oyam District, read out a bi-partisan resolution, endorsing Mr Museveni as the sole candidate.Mr Ojok was seconded by Mr Onac Okello, the Kwania District chairperson (UPC), Mr Brian Ogutu, the Oyam District councillor and FDC chairperson; Mr Celestine Ouma, the Oyam District councillor (UPC), and Mr Masor Bashir, the male councillor (UPC). The UPC secretary general, Mr Fred Ebil Ebil, warned that the UPC leaders who endorsed Mr Museveni s sole candidature in the 2021 elections would face disciplinary action. Mr Ebil Ebil said the UPC regional office will this week convene a meeting of district party chairpersons to discuss the matter.  This is because those individuals do not hold any authority to make decisions on behalf of the country s oldest political party rather than the UPC National Council,  he said yesterday.  We are looking for evidence to pin those UPC members who were reported in the media to have endorsed Mr Museveni as sole candidate for 2021,  UPC secretary general added.According to Mr Ebil Ebil, UPC has never endorsed any presidential candidate because the party is also preparing to front their candidate for the top most political seat. We are not supporting anybody who has shown interest to contest for presidential elections of 2021 apart from UPC candidate,  he said in an interview.  But if the Opposition political parties decide to form a coalition and front a single candidate for presidency, that position can only be determined by the National Council of UPC but not anybody else,  he added. The Member of Parliament for Erute South in Lira District, Mr Jonathan Odur, said the people who are purported to have endorsed President Museveni on behalf of Lango to fulfil their selfish gains should be publicly condemned.  Less than 1 per cent of Langi cannot claim to have endorsed [President] Museveni without making any consultations in all the constituencies. These are people who are money hungry who have just joined NRM and they are trying to show that they are more powerful than those who were in NRM before,  Mr Odur said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UPC-punish-members-endorsing-Museveni-s-sole-candidature/688334-5123954-fhrmxoz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post22.png
20,Government starts relocation of Bududa landslide victims to Bulambuli - Daily Monitor,"Bududa. The truck groans and squeaks as it climbs the murram road. Perched on atop, between pieces of furniture and assorted personal effects.In the vans are men, women and children anxious to reach the promised land.  As perilous as it seems, this journey is a flight to safety. After months in makeshift camps, survivors of recent landslides on the slopes of Mt Elgon in eastern Uganda are finally being relocated to permanent homes in safer areas.   This is the day we have been waiting for,  said Mr Boaz Mutinye, a landslide survivor and head of Shisambwa Village in Bukalasi Sub-county.  We will live here happily with no life threats posed by the landslides,  he said. The relocation began slowly, with 10 households of 60 people moved to Bunambutye in Bulambuli District, where the government, through the Office of the Prime Minister, has built new homes.A few remain in temporary camps while more than 10,000 are living in their homes, which are at risk of landslides. About 100 households will be relocated over the next two weeks in the first phase. Each household will get a two-bedroom house on an acre of land, with another two acres for agriculture. The move has rescued survivors  from the jaws of death , says Ms Lydia Nandudu, who lost family members in the most recent landslide in Bukalasi.  We have been having sleepless nights whenever it rains. We will now sleep without disruptions,  she said, breaking out in a gospel song. Mr Isaac Mugera, an OPM spokesman, said heavy rain and difficult terrain had delayed the resettlement. BenefitsThe government, he said, will feed the families for a year, long enough for them to grow and harvest their own food.  A health centre has also been built nearby for the communities, although the recent arrivals will have to find places in area schools, as the new term is about to open. The UPDF s Engineering Brigade built the houses between December and March. Some 900 houses will be built at a cost of Shs32 billion on the 2,800-acre piece of land government acquired in 2013 as part of a 10-year resettlement plan. The plan has not been without challenges: residents attached to their ancestral lands and are reluctant to leave their landslide-prone homes, while disputes remain over the ownership and suitability of some of the resettlement land. For those lucky enough to get onto the relocation trucks, however, the relatively short journey away from the mountain slopes is a giant leap from danger and a chance to break new ground.ReallocationThe construction of 101 houses by the Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) Engineering Brigade and police s construction unit, started on December 15, 2018 and they were completed by March, 2019. According to the resettlement scheme on the 2,800 acres of land, which the government acquired in 2013, 250 houses will be constructed on Plot 94, which measures 270 acres. Plot 157, which is 918 acres, will house 650 houses, while Plot 198, measuring 1,688 acres, will be reserved for mechanised agricultural production.

21,"Ntagali condemns theft of public funds, immorality - Daily Monitor","Butebo/Tororo. The Church of Uganda Archbishop, the Rt Rev Stanley Ntagali, has decried gross misappropriation of public funds that has led to loss of taxpayers  money.The prelate made the remarks while bidding farewell to Christians of Bukedi Diocese at St John s Church of Uganda, the headquarters of Butebo Archdeaconry, at the weekend.He warned against amassing wealth through dubious means and encouraged believers to work hard.  The negative attitude towards work coupled with the prevailing poverty have fuelled corruption through stealing of public funds,  Archbishop Ntagali said. People should instead work hard to own their properties. I strongly condemn the increasing theft of funds. The raging immorality is becoming another cancer that is increasingly eating up society; for instance, I did strongly oppose homosexuality and became an enemy to some donors who had proposed to impose this act on us,  he addedFirm on Church position I have no apology for having stood strong to protect the church from these evil acts. I therefore salute the House of Bishops for being behind me in this struggle to oppose homosexuality. We need to stand on the biblical truth that requires man to marry a woman and not man to man or woman to woman. This is totally against the canons of the Bible and should strongly be rejected. The Archbishop first laid a foundation stone at St Philip Church of Uganda in Kawojan, Kabwangasi Parish, Butebo, where 90 per cent of the works have been funded by the family of Ms Elizabeth Aisu.A brass band then led the procession of hundreds of believers through Butebo Trading Centre, up to the venue, which was approximately about 4kms, as Christians endured the scorching sunshine.The Archbishop asked Christians to pray for Uganda. The country is faced with many challenges. We need to pray for them and for the new Bishop of Soroti Diocese, who is awaiting consecration,  Archbishiop Ntagali said.In TororoWhile in Tororo District , the prelate said the continuous demand for the carving out of administrative units in the Anglican Church is a clear demonstration of the growing faith.He said already in the pipeline is the outstanding approval for carving out of East Busoga Diocese and West Rwenzori Diocese, which will increase the number of dioceses from the current 37 to 39. When I was enthroned the Archbishop of Church of Uganda, they were only 34 but out of demand for self-autonomy by Christians. I managed to carve more three and recently Christians initiated carving of two more dioceses, which I have okayed and they are likely to be inaugurated before I retire,   Archbishop Ntagali said.The Archbishop has been in Bukedi Diocese on his final tour ahead of his retirement in March 1, 2020.He commended Christians of Bukedi Diocese for the commitment and strong faith that has helped the diocese grow stronger, which has been evidenced by creation of archdeaconries and parishes.Church of Uganda constitution requires that at 65 years, one is mandated to retire.In June 2012, Archbishop Ntagali was elected by two thirds majority as the 8th Archbishop of the Church of Uganda. The election was presided over by Rt Rev Nicodemus Okille, the Dean of the Church of the Province of Uganda. Previous ArchbishopsPrevious Archbishops of the Church of Uganda are Leslie Brown, a British missionary, was the first Archbishop of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Boga-Zaire [1961-1966], Erch Sabiti [1966-1974], Janani Luwum [1974-1977-martyred in 1977, Silvanus Wani [1977-1983].

22,500 residents share one borehole - Daily Monitor,"Luweero. More than 500 people in Katagwe Parish, Kamira Sub- county, Luweero District, spend about six hours queuing at one borehole to get water while hundreds of others share an abandoned dam with animals. Mothers are failing to engage in any productive work because they spend it lining up at the borehole,  Mr Ponsiano Katumba, the Katagwe chairperson, said during a village meeting at the weekend.  Sometimes we have to escort our wives at night to line up at the borehole where they spend more than six hours before returning home. Many residents have resorted to using dirty water shared with animals,  he added.Mr Patrick Mwesigye, the Kamira councillor, said the situation has compromised the health of residents. We have repeatedly petitioned the district authorities to provide more safe water sources with little success. The few shallow wells drilled by the district water department dried up just a few months after being commissioned,  Mr Mwesigye said. Ms Rebecca Nakanjako, a resident of Katagwe, said women are at risk of being raped since they move late at night.The State Minister for Local Government, Ms Jenipher Namuyangu, tasked district leaders to address the challenge. The district should prioritise the well-being of residents by ensuring they have safe water. It is the duty of the leaders to be transparent and ensure that the residents get to know about all the projects being implemented including the accountability component,  Ms Namuyangu said.Mr Henry Musisi, the district assistant chief administrative officer, attributed the low safe water coverage in the area due to the low water table resulting from the poor bed rock that does not favour establishment of shallow wells. The district is, however, sourcing for additional funding to ensure that these areas get the deep bore holes. Each deep borehole costs about Shs19m. The district plans to allocate more funds for the safe water sources for Kamira in the new financial year 2019/2020,  Mr Musisi said.Early this month, the district leaders said they had partnered with the National Water and Sewerage Corporation to extend piped water to all remote villages, especially in the cattle corridor areas. Under the partnership, the district has already committed more than Shs30m to extend piped water to Lutuula, Namatogonya, Kiiya, Lukinzi and Lusanja villages in Butuntumula Sub-county. Water coverageCurrently, clean piped water is only accessible by 27.5 per cent of the district population in Luweero Town, Wobulenzi, Bombo, Zirobwe, Kikyusa and Bamunanika. Last year, NWSC secured Shs15b to extend piped water to more 406 villages in Luweero, Wobulenzi, Semuto, Bombo, Kapeeka and Zirobwe.Statistics from the district water office indicate that about 76 per cent of the total population depend on water point sources.

23,UPDF takes over security at Kawolo hospital - Daily Monitor,"Buikwe. Uganda People s Defence Forces (UPDF) have been deployed at Kawolo hospital in Buikwe District to crack down on the theft of building materials following a public request.The health facility is currently undergoing renovation and expansion.Residents and the hospital administration through the Resident District Commissioner, Ms Jane Frances Kagayi, called for the army s intervention after efforts by a private security company and police proved futile.Thugs have been stealing cement, iron bars, doors, solar panels and taps, among other materials.Daily Monitor learnt that private guards and police officers were withdrawn on May 9 while at least 20 UPDF soldiers from UPDF Engineering Brigade, Lugazi took over. Dr Joshua Kiberu, the hospital medical superintendent, said the deployment will improve security. The situation has been terrible, some of us could not catch sleep ever since the renovation works started. Now that the soldiers are here, we know they are going to solve this problem (theft),  Dr Kiberu said in an interview last week. Those people (thieves) have been stealing anything they could come across, and we were getting worried that one time, they might steal our patients,   he added. Dr Kiberu also said they are now challenged with replacing stolen items from the new buildings that have already been handed over. The contractor has been handing over whatever building he completes so that we can start using them for our daily operations. It is from these buildings where expensive items such as solar panels and doors, among others things, have been stolen,  he said.Dr Kiberu said the administration is yet to compute the amount of money lost in the theft.The renovation works are being undertaken by Excel Construction Company Ltd at a tune of Shs39b.Brig Richard Karemire, the UPDF spokesperson, said he was not aware of the deployment and referred us to UPDF officers at Gaddafi Barracks in Jinja District.Ms Kagayi, who chairs the district security committee, said deployment was a last resort. It was a hard decision to take, but we had nothing to do. Let our people cooperate with them (soldiers) by giving them information about that racket of stealing building materials,  she said.ReliefMr Steven Kikawula Mugoya, a councillor representing Kiwawula Ward at Lugazi Municipality, welcomed the deployment.  They have taken so long to come, but it is good they have responded and we do not expect to hear any more stealing of property,   Mr Mugoya said.A soldier, who talked to this newspaper on condition of anonymity since he is not the authorised to speak to the press, urged patients and caregivers not worry about their presence, saying they are there to restore sanity. We act differently in situations like this. So, those who have been surviving on stealing from this government facility, they should not dare step here again,   the army officer said.About hospitalKawolo hospital had not received major renovation since 1968. The hospital administrator, Dr Joshua Kiberu, said more than 90 per cent of the renovation works have been done, adding that fixing some machines and erection of a perimeter wall are left. Among the new facilities constructed are a trauma centre, a modern mortuary, new out-patient block, four staff houses and two operating theatres. The hospital has also been boosted with harvest tanks. The project, which will officially be handed over to government later this year, is funded by the Spanish government.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/UPDF-takes-over-security-Kawolo-hospital/688334-5122560-2qyyvk/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post26.png
24,Nema vows to arrest wetland encroachers - Daily Monitor,"Kayunga. Encroachers who recently reclaimed a section of Ssezibwa wetland in Kayunga and Mukono districts face arrest, National Environment Management (Nema) officials have said.More than 500 people were evicted from the area in December last year.However, Mr Nicholas Magara, the Nema coordinator of wetland matters in the central region, said the encroachers have failed to respect the commitment. Last year, we were lenient and didn t arrest them. However, this time we are going to arrest and prosecute them and no one is going to blame us,  Mr Magara said last week.Section 36 of the National Environment Act provides for the protection of wetlands and prohibits reclamation, erection of illegal structures and empowers authorities to demolish any structure that is fixed in, on, under or above any wetland. The Kayunga environment officer, Mr Patrick Musaazi, said they are working with the Resident District Commissioner, District Internal Security Officer and the environment police to take action against the encroachers. We don t want any political interference when time comes to arrest those people,  Mr Musaazi said.A source within the police in Kayunga said a letter had been written to the commandant of the environmental protection unit in February about the issue, but said he had not received a response.Plead for leniency Some encroachers said they were forced back to cultivate in the wetland due to lack of arable land. We are landless yet we have to pay school fees for our children. We ask the President to allow us to grow crops because we have nowhere to go,  Mr Moses Mukisa, a resident, said.Statistics show that the country has lost more than 30 per cent of its wetlands in the last 23 years.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Nema-vows-arrest-wetland-encroachers/688334-5122568-30j940z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post27.png

26,Take risk to succeed in business - Kyambadde - Daily Monitor,"Amuru. The Minister of Trade, Industries and Cooperatives, Ms Amelia Kyambadde, has advised women in Acholi Sub-region to take risk if they are to succeed in their business ventures. Speaking on Thursday during the inauguration of Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd in Atiak Sub-county, Amuru District, Ms Kyambadde said many women in the region shy away from venturing into business opportunities that would turn profitable and change their lives because they fear losing money. Be ready to take risks, if you don t take risks, you will not be anywhere, take that risk to start a business and succeed,  she said adding that most of the successful people around the world took risks.Ms Kyambadde cited Amina Moghe Hersi, who is establishing Atiak Sugar Factory in Amuru saying she took a risk to start her investment.She lauded the outgrowers for venturing into sugarcane growing since the sugar industry is one of the key industries in East Africa citing that in Uganda, sugar production has increased by 10 per cent from 240,000 metric tonnes in 2008 to now 430,000 metric tonnes currently.Ms Kyambadde promised to help women outgrowers dealing in the production of honey, Shea butter oil, ground nut butter and crafts with fast tracking certification of their products.Ms Joyce Santa Laker, the chairperson Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd, said four districts are now directly implementing sugarcane growing citing Adjumani, Lamwo, Gulu and Amuru.She noted that their ultimate goal is to change the mind-set of the community and engage them in productivity.Ms Amina Moghe Hersi, the owner of Atiak Sugar Factory, told women that the region will now be the food basket of Africa since they will produce all food crops.Cooperative membershipThe Atiak Sugar Planting Outgrowers  Cooperative Ltd comprises 4,070 members, majority of whom are women from Acholi Sub-region and Adjumani District, who were former abductees, sex workers, persons with disability, HIV/Aids persons and those from nodding syndrome families.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Take-risk-succeed-business-Kyambadde/688334-5122600-kigj8e/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post29.png

The Bishop of Kinkiizi Diocese, Rt Rev Dan Zoreka, has said the future of the country will depend on the shaping of the young generation, and asked parents and community members to end child neglect and abuse.Officiating at the opening of a four-day women s conference in Kihihi Archdeaconry organised by Rev Ven Justus Tibesigwa on Friday, Bishop Zoreka said children have been neglected and parents do not talk to them to show them the right way. He added that the conditions children are living in are not favourable for their prosperity. Our children today are abused, they are given work that doesn t suit them, many have been neglected, abused and are subjected to torture. Praise God if you see yourself still doing well for your children.  These children will be here when we are not. As a nation, we must rise and work together to nurture the children so that when time comes, we get gifts from them,  Bishop Zoreka said.He said parents need to create time for their children and instil in them good values instead of trusting schools. He added:  These days, there are many things that pull us away; many parents are busy, they are looking for money in all ways. A parent can be busy and the whole week passes without talking to their children. The conference attracted more than 1,500 women from various parishes. Topics covered include attitude change, confidence-building, economic empowerment and personal development.  You can t nurture a child without money, you must be empowered economically; you can t parent when you don t have food thus you must be a hardworking mother who has food; you can t nurture a child when you are not a good example you must be a good example as a mother and a parent so that when a child is being nurtured, he sees you as a symbol of love,  Bishop Zoreka said.Businessman James Musinguzi Garuga asked women to develop self-confidence and should not take husbands as providers but partners in development if they want their families to succeed.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Bishop-Zoreka-decries-child-neglect-abuse/688334-5122680-rgn9cfz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post30.png
28,Theatres close over lack of staff - Daily Monitor,"KAKUMIRO. Kakumiro District health centres have abandoned key medical and surgical operations as their only theatres remain closed over lack of technical staff.Kakumiro District only has two well equipped theatres at Kakumiro and Kakindo health centre IVs in Kakumiro and Kakindo town councils, respectively. They all serve about 350,000 people. The crisis of key theatre staff such as anesthetists and theatre assistants has left the theatres closed for about a year.Key surgeries such as hernia, caesarean operation on expectant mothers and critical life threatening injuries cannot be handled there and patients are referred to either Mubende or Hoima regional referral hospitals, which are about an hour s drive away. The in-charge of Kakindo Health Centre, Dr Hargreaves Byaruhanga, said the theatre has been closed because of lack of key staff and this has left people to suffer with referrals. We have been raising our concerns ever since Infectious Diseases institute (IDI) stopped the  Saving Mothers, Giving Life  project, that was supporting us with staff. Later, everything came to a standstill,   Dr Byaruhanga said. He added:  Some expectant mothers have died or lost their babies because we refer them to Hoima or Mubende and these are distant places. We understand the pain our people are enduring and yet all their concerns would be attended to at our theatre here  .Ms Jane Kamagara, a resident of Kalangala Village, Kibijo Sub-county, Kagadi District, said her daughter lost a baby after she was referred to Mubende hospital and she reached late and doctors could not save her unborn baby.Ms Vastina Kabarungi, a resident of Irora Village in Kiryanga Sub-county, in the neighbouring Kagadi District, said she had battled hernia infection for years but she could not get operated on at Kakindo Health Centre IV because of the challenges at the theatre.Her life was saved last week when Adalante Africa, a non-government organisation held a free surgical camp with doctors from Spain. Dr Israel Kyejimbo, the in-charge at Kakumiro Health centre IV in Kakumiro Town Council, said the crisis has also affected operations at the health facility.  It is true that our theatre has not been working for about one year and the problem started when IDI withdrew the personnel support. We nowadays refer all cases necessitating surgery to Mubende hospital. We have received several cases of expectant mothers suffering ruptured uterus and others losing their babies because of delayed attention and poor transport system,   Dr Kyejimbo said.The Kakumiro District health officer, Dr Robert Senteza, said:   We have a known challenge for human resource in health in the district due to inadequate wage bill especially of critical staff gaps in that area of service of the theatre. With all stakeholders at all levels aware of this service delivery hiccup, joint collective efforts are on and the population should remain calm and hopeful as we try our best for the best,   Dr Senteza said.The Kakumiro District Chief Administrative Officer, Mr Stephen Monday, said the need for key staff at the health centers has been included in the next financial year recruitment plan.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Theatres-close-over-lack-staff/688334-5122686-158drrhz/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post31.png

33,Australia election stokes mistrust in opinion polls - Daily Monitor,"The failure of opinion polls to tip a conservative win in Australia's elections has raised questions about their credibility just years after similar errors in forecasting Brexit and Donald Trump's victory in the US.Australia's ruling Liberal-National coalition claimed a shock victory in Saturday's election, after two years of trailing the opposition Labor Party in every major national poll.The polls showed a slight tightening between the two main parties with Labor ahead roughly 51-49 just before the election.The tentative result, pending final results from the Australian Electoral Commission, shows the coalition instead ahead 51-49 on Monday.""Why did we have such an amazing sequence of polls in a row that all got the same (results) "" Australian polling analyst Kevin Bonham told AFP of the years of polling that pointed to a Labor victory.Most media routinely rely on polls -- surveys of hundreds, sometimes thousands of voters by phone or online -- to flag political trends and tip the leading candidates.But question marks were raised about their accuracy in 2016 after the failure to forecast Britain's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's triumph in the US presidential election.In Australia, political polling has had a good record, and is so closely followed in Canberra that a string of prime ministers were dumped by their own parties over the past decade over poor showings in surveys.Traditionally, pollsters contacted voters using extensive landline lists, such as the phone book. But with voters ditching landlines, it is become more difficult for pollsters to collect an accurate representative sample of the electorate.Bonham said signs polling was becoming less accurate had emerged at the state level, particularly ahead of regional elections in Victoria state in November which failed to capture a strong swing to the incumbent Labor government.""It's become increasingly harder to actually just find where a telephone number is and therefore design an efficient sample,"" Martin O'Shannessy, the ex-chief of major Australian pollster Newspoll, told AFP.""This is being faced by the whole research industry and what we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg.""Pollsters have also turned to cheaper forms of collecting opinions, such as robocalls and online surveys, which experts say are significantly less accurate.O'Shannessy said the key problems that emerged from the polls of the 2016 US elections were similar.""The good quality polls, which did the best job that they could have sampling... and used human operators, generally got the answer right. However they were only 12 percent of all the polls,"" he said.""The other 88 percent were online (polls), robopolls... the average error for those polls was five percent and the biggest error was 10 percent.""One alternative method of sampling voters has been through social media.In Australia, Griffith University data scientist Bela Stantic said he accurately predicted Trump's win, Brexit and the conservatives' win on Saturday by analysing millions of social media comments.He told news.com.au he was successful as he had used large sample sizes -- some two million ""relevant"" tweets from around half a million accounts.O'Shannessy said to make news polls more accurate, Australia's market research sector was lobbying for access to the government's Integrated Public Number Database (IPND), which contains all listed and unlisted telephone numbers and is used by emergency services and law enforcement.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Australia-election-opinion-polls-Brexit-Donald-Trump/688334-5123084-1svn26/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post36.png
34,Kenyan court due to rule on decriminalising homosexuality - Daily Monitor,"Kenya's High Court is on Friday expected to deliver a long-awaited ruling on whether to scrap colonial-era laws which criminalise homosexuality, a verdict that could have repercussions across Africa.However, the LGBT community fears yet another postponement. In February, the three-judge bench pushed back its decision, citing a heavy workload, prompting dismay from a persecuted community who have fought for years to be accepted.""There are a lot of mixed emotions around this because people are just wary of the fact that it could be postponed yet again,"" Brian Macharia of the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya (GALCK), one of the petitioners, told AFP.""Everyone is just hopeful and we recognise that things could go either way.""Gay rights organisations are asking the court to scrap two sections of the penal code that criminalise homosexuality.One section states that anyone who has ""carnal knowledge... against the order of nature"" can be imprisoned for 14 years. Another provides for a five-year jail term for ""indecent practices between males"".Activists believe Kenya has a chance to blaze a trail in Africa where homophobia is virulent in many communities, with similar laws in over half the countries on the continent.While convictions under the decades-old laws are rare, gay activists say the legislation is unconstitutional and fuels homophobia.The National Gay And Lesbian Human Rights Commission says it dealt with 15 prosecutions under the laws in 2018, with no convictions recorded.Unimaginable harmThe petitioners argue that under Kenya's 2010 constitution, every person is said to be equal before the law.However members of the LGBT community are blackmailed, evicted, fired, expelled from school, or assaulted over their sexual orientation, but are unable to access justice without effectively confessing to a crime.""LGBTQ people in Kenya for years and years have faced and suffered violence and harm in unimaginable ways, but justice has not been afforded to them because of the penal code,"" said Macharia.Activists are optimistic of an eventual ruling in their favour, given recent decisions by the court.In March, the High Court banned forced anal testing of men suspected of being gay.And in September, a court ruled that ""Rafiki"" (""Friend""), a film about a lesbian love affair which was the first Kenyan movie to be shown at the Cannes film festival, could be screened domestically for seven days after its initial banning.Macharia said Kenya's powerful churches had been holding special events in the leadup to the ruling to fight what they term ""the LGBT agenda"".""The church is spreading a lot of hatred, a lot of misinformation,"" he said.The petition is being fought by an association of Catholics, Protestants and evangelicals.Twenty-eight out of 49 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have laws penalising same-sex relationships, according to Neela Ghoshal, a Human Rights Watch (HRW) specialist in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.The death penalty is on the books, under Islamic sharia law, in Mauritania, Sudan and northern Nigeria, although there have been no known executions in recent times. In southern Somalia, gay men are believed to have been put to death in territory ruled by the Al-Shabaab jihadist group.Angola, Mozambique and Seychelles have scrapped anti-gay laws in recent years.On the other hand, Chad and Uganda have introduced or toughened legislation.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Kenyan-court-decriminalising-homosexuality-Gay-Lesbian/688340-5125998-lctu1w/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post37.png
35,Ocaya to bring his car dream to life - Daily Monitor,"Born to Silverno Orinyo from Zombo, Matthias Ocaya, 25, is one of the innovators in the vocational field, thanks to his persistence. An old student of Otoroga Boys Primary School in Zombo, Ocaya started dreaming about joining vocational education then, but his father would not hear any of it.  After Primary Seven, I told my father that I wanted to enroll in a vocational institute although he wanted me to continue to secondary school. So, I joined St Aloysius Secondary School in Zombo District and while there, my knowledge on innovation developed,  Ocaya recalls. He got career guidance and learned that he could actually go enroll in a vocational school after O-Level.  Whenever we got holidays, I would go to different people in my village for apprenticeship in plumbing work, building and wiring. I did that from Senior One holidays to Senior Four. In Senior Four vacation, I built myself a house and since I wanted to make a door for it, I went to a certain carpenter in my village to ask him for his equipment,  he says. But the carpenter instead asked him to come and help him at his workshop since he had no one to work with. Ocaya started work the following day.  I made my door but also learnt more skills, so, next, I made myself a bed but before I could take it home, a buyer asked for it. I told him I could make him one and he paid me Shs200,000. This was the first money I earned and through him, I got many more customers,  he narrates. Although Ocaya did carpentry work, being a mechanic was his ultimate dream. After Senior Four vacation, he still expressed interest in vocational education but his father still did not want him to go.  I joined A-Level at Paidha Senior Secondary School but class things had gotten a bit slow for me. I looked for a garage in the area where I would work at the weekend and during the holiday. It was then that I thought about making a prototype of a car from timber,  he says. Realising his dreamWith six points after A-Level, he joined vocational school. Ocaya joined Lugogo Vocational Institute in Kampala in 2016.  Two weeks into the course, I went to my lecturer and told him I wanted to build a car. He asked me how I was going to do it and told me to write a proposal with all the details and to also draw what I wanted to make. He also asked me whether I would be able to pull it off,  Ocaya explains. In first year, when real life projects were introduced and they were asked to make stoves, Ocaya had bigger fish to fry in mind.  In second year when they told us to build something, I just wanted to build a car. I already had my proposal and I told the teacher that I wanted to make a car, but he said that could not work. I went and talked to the head of department, who gave me a go ahead,  he recalls.Financial constraitsOcaya had no money. So during holidays, he went to the village and found work.  I earned Shs150,000 which I used to buy some things such as a motor, magnetar and other things for my prototype.  Ocaya spent two and a half months building the car in addition to building and designing things such as DC stoves, water pumps and a car heater for friends in order to get money for his prototype. After completing his prototype, he took it to the teacher and showed off his dream. The prototype was a solar driven car with an external steering wheel which he could use to control its movements.  But because I had a tuition debt, I went back to the village to look for money. From there, I was called by the principal for a vocational exhibition at Parliament in November 2017. I was also allowed to do my examinations. But when I went back to the village with my Shs400,000 that I had got from people who saw my innovation at the exhibition, I decided to build a big car which I am currently working on but won t give a lot of details about it for now,  Ocaya asserts.  I was also recently invited to an exhibition at UBTEB, where I exhibited my car before the Education minister Janet Museveni. But as I work on my big project, I also work in a garage in my village because I still have a debt at school,  he says. Ocaya needs about Shs95m to build his first big prototype of a solar driven car. Other student innovationsTogether with his robotics team, the International University of East Africa students built a car surveillance system. Andrew Bakashaba said, this is a smart home surveillance system that will have multiple functions. It will be able to; pick up sound, take videos, see what is at a distance, will be able to detect obstacles and able to control the lighting system in a home using a timer. It will also be able to pick feedback, move for example in a compound or house and do all those functions. I specifically did the parking coding that detects obstacles. We have built a control module/app that is connected to a mobile app, so it can connect everywhere, plus the camera module. We are still working on that body to adopt to functions and implement some parts but we want to have a working prototype soon. The surveillance car works as a proof of concept that we can build our own robots without studying a specific course.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Ocaya-car-dream-to-life-carpentry-work-Zombo-District/688336-5112776-rvg9my/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post38.png
36,Want to boost your career  Read - Daily Monitor,"Gives me confidenceMy job is to sell knowledge, history and tell a story the clients have no idea about. This has taught me to read constantly. Everyday I read something in relation to travel. Before taking any person to the site, I visit it first, make research and buy any written literature about it. I read any travel literature I come across naturally. I even read about the different Christian historical sites. I may not necessarily buy a book, but I carry out research and read online. This has opened my mind and widened my knowledge about different cultures. When I am talking to people; I speak with confidence because I am sure about what I am telling them. Mary Josephina Nanyonga, tours and travel dealerMotivated my career choiceMy reading journey started while in primary school. I enjoyed reading fictional stories such as Mr Hare tales because I found them entertaining. While in secondary school I would visit the school library to read novels during my free time. I read a book titled To Be the Best by Barbara Taylor which motivated me to aim higher and opened me up to more of her work such as A woman of Substance, which inspired me to pursue a career in finance. Currently, I read mathematics-related articles and mainly motivational books. My current read is Nice Girls Don t Get the Corner Office which talks about unconscious mistakes women make that sabotage their careers.Ann Kyakuwaire, auditorReading makes me practicalKyamanywa handles civil law cases to do with property, family issues that entail divorce, annulment, child custody. Because of his choice of work, he says his reading is not about to end. To manage handling the different cases I realised I need to have an inquisitive mind, excellent analytical skills and the ability to think.  At times clients expect an immediate answer. With this I came to a conclusion that lawyers need to be good readers. I read books such as Civil rights and Liberties in the 21 century, In Our Defense. The Civil Rights book gives an analysis of the Supreme Court s landmark rulings on civil rights and liberties. Reading has made me resourceful to my clients, taught me new court presentations and has helped me improve on my vocabulary. However, it calls for commitment. Currently, I am reading My Life in Court by Louise Nizer. Edward Cooper Kyamanywa, lawyerBroadened my thinkingMy reading culture started at the age of 10. In those early years I read a lot of adventure books. I would literally feel as if I was on the same adventure journey as the characters in the book. As a teen, I began reading literature from authors such as Jeffrey Archer, Wilbur Smith and Danielle Steele, which helped me understand new concepts about life and my vocabulary. While in high school he was introduced to African authors such as Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe and others whose works gave him a new understanding of the continent. Today, I read different genres of literature, popular psychology, faith-based books, biographies, African books on history and economics, leadership and management books, motivational books. Reading has broadened my mind. I am able to know and understand a variety of topics. Currently, I am reading Purple Cow by Seth Godin, which is about avoiding being average. If you want to develop a reading culture, start slowly with one book at a time, those that you will enjoy, as well as joining a book club.Stirling Gapara, leadership and management consultantEnlightened meAmos Wekesa s reading culture did not develop until 2001 when he committed to reading for two hours a day. Reading different literature such as Transformation of Singapore from third world to second world, Problems of Africa, he says his reading kept improving. When reading, I spare 45 minute to read about a topic I am involved in. This has given me leverage over many people who come to me for information. I was influenced into reading by my wife. My wife is a good reader and so are my children. I realised if I did not read I would remain the idiot of the family. Writing has also given me an opportunity to read. The more you write, the more you read.Amos Wekesa, tourism entrepreneurKeeps my brain activeMy father used to read a lot. When I was a child, he would read to me story books written in Rutooro. Slowly, I began to broaden my reading scope. When I joined Nyakasura School, I started a newspaper called The Student. But today, I read medicine-related material, I read about the latest advances, news about medicine and I do a lot of research.  I keep tickling my brain by reading all the necessary literature within my profession and others I find relevant. Vincent Karuhanga, doctorLeaders are readers Leaders are readers. If you want to be a leader then you must be a reader. If you want to excel in any field such as being a politician or fashion designer you have to be a long-life learner and reader.  In life there has to be continuous improvement in all that we do. And the way you can improve is to continuously read.   If the last time you read a book was the time you graduated from university, yet you have been working for the last five years, it means you are stunted. As an educationist, I read constantly. I believe, the more you read, the better you become. Through reading I have been mentored by different people I admire but can never have conversations with. My recent great read has been by Michelle Obama s, Becoming. But currently I am reading The 15 Rules of Growth by John Maxwell. He says growth is intentional, not accidental. To inspire my children to read, each time any of them reads a book I put Shs10,000 in their piggy bank.

37,"Digital libraries, game-changer in rural schools - Daily Monitor","In October last year, Nyombi Thembo, the director Rural Communications Development Fund at the Uganda Communications Commission, announced government would introduce video conferencing lessons aimed at connecting rural schools to their urban counterparts. According to Thembo, the move is aimed at providing rural and urban students the same learning opportunities. We want a situation where a good Mathematics teacher in St Mary s College, Kisubi is giving a lesson, and some 100 rural schools in Karamoja following this lesson,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries. To support the move, National Social Security Fund (NSSF) has injected more than Shs450m to provide tablets to mainly underpriviledged secondary schools so as to compete favourably with priviledged schools.While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation, owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.In the wake of this attempt at digitising teaching and learning, the National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) has embarked on a pilot project in four schools within Kampala where they are establishing digital libraries.

While rolling out the first tablets at Mpummudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District recently, Richard Byarugaba, the NSSF managing director, said digital libraries will ease teaching and learning especially in schools that face challenges of inadequate reading materials and facilities.  The traditional education system is undergoing transformation owing to the ever advancing technology. Unfortunately, the use of technology in Uganda s education system is almost non-existent, especially in government-aided schools which are often underfunded,  he said.So far, the Fund has donated at least 440 digital learning tablets to 11 schools with each school receiving 40 tablets. The project is expected to benefit more than 3,500 students in Senior Four and Senior Six in the next one year and more than 5,200 students in the next two years. Aggrey Kibenge, the Under Secretary in the Ministry of Education and Sports, says the initiative will help students in underpriviledged schools to rise up to the occasion and compete favourably with their counterparts in priviledged schools.  Students in schools that do not have access to modern learning facilities will get exposure to and access modern learning resources and tools. I look forward to a time when all secondary schools will benefit from this type of digital technology to transform teaching and learning,  he said.Infrastructure issuesSanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher of Mpummudde Seed Secondary School, said he is supportive of the project and hopes it will help in reducing the workload for teachers and expose students to a wide range of learning materials as well as the digital world.However, he expressed worry that due to limited space in some government-aided schools for instance, as a result of the surging numbers in student population, buildings to house digital libraries must be put up.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space for this digital library. My teachers do not have where to sit because the staffroom is now occupied with the tablets,  he lamented. James Asili, the head of department for secondary schools and coordinator of the Digital Library project at NCDC, is optimistic that the tablet will prepare students for a digital curriculum with multiple content. The tablet costs Shs600,000 but Asili is hopeful that the cost will reduce with time. How the tablet works Ivan Mukasa, the software engineer in charge of the digital library project, says the digital tablets have been tailored to the school curriculum inclusive of all subjects for both O and A levels.  The tablet has been fitted with virtual learn software that incorporates the curriculum for both O and A levels. Each subject follows topics as designed in the curriculum. We shall keep modifying it to suit the students  needs,  he reveals.He further explains,  At the end of each topic, a student can do a self-assessment basing on the three levels of assessment. If the student fails the assessment, they are advised to retake and complete it. All the students  work and assessments are stored on the cloud for review by teachers as well as NCDC officials for analysis on how students are progressing in different subjects, for instance by analysing the difficult and easy topics.    It is also designed with an e-book readers  icon which enables students to buy online text books and read on their own. The virtual learn also permits performance tracking by schools and parents that can be accessed on Android mobile phones,  Mukasa adds.The tablet can be used both online and offline. Even better, a solar backpack has been provided in cases of power blackout or shortages.  At first the goal was to develop a virtual lab for sciences but then later we agreed to incorporate both arts and sciences. Students can even tap into the syllabus and read ahead of the teacher and do assessments.  Students react Hendrick Oboth, a Senior Six student, says he is enthusiastic about the digital library and hopes it will improve his learning.  I have realised there are things teachers fail to explain well in class but which you can read and understand on the tablets on your own. Similarly, Doreen Mugala, a Senior Four student, says it will ease her studies and help her get more details through research.  I will also be able to acquire skills in ICT which I may require in future,  she hopefully says.Knowing how many rural school grapple with poorly stocked libraries or nonexistent libraries at all, digital libraries could be the timely intervention to bridge the gap between rural underprivildged schools and priviledged ones.Other edu-tabsKaino Africa, a smart school management tech company last year launched their flagship product, the Kaino Tablet crafted for the Ugandan primary pupil. This Education Technology (EdTech) tablet comes with curriculum aligned teacher guides that show the teacher lesson plans; how they are supposed to proceed with the class, what examples to give as well as time the lesson is supposed to start and end. It comes with well-prepared notes from Ugandan content providers, not to mention, it has offline and online past papers, exams and instant assessments at the end of the tests. All this comes in addition to digitalised text books that are cheap (between USD1 to USD10) (about Shs38,000).BeneficiariesThe beneficiary schools include: Mpummudde Secondary School in Jinja, Nabumali High School Mbale, Atutur Seed Secondary School in Soroti, Sir Tito Winyi Secondary School in Hoima, Kagamba Secondary School in Mbarara, Kyenjojo Secondary School in Fort Portal and St. Charles Lwanga SS, Kasasa in Masaka.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Digital-libraries-game-changer-rural-schools/688336-5101196-e93vek/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post40.png
38,Essay challenge brings students  knowledge on biotechnology to life - Daily Monitor,"In a bid to familiarise students with modern biotechnology, National Crop Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) organised the Biotechnology Essay Writing Contest among secondary and university students.Resty Nansubuga, the 17-year-old science student at St Joseph s Girls Senior Secondary School, who scooped the best essay award in the secondary school category, says she only learnt about plant breeding using modern biotechnology in a bid to develop Genetically Modified Organisms crops from her teacher recently.Her essay focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food under the theme;  Modern Biosciences for more nutritious food . She explained the use of breeding crops using advanced technology to develop improved varieties which have better nutrition and are high yielding hence capable of feeding the world s growing population.Organised by the Uganda Biosciences Information centre, the competition attracted several students who, like Nansubuga, had scanty knowledge about crop breeding. Widespread issueBut this lack of knowledge is also true in majority of Ugandans who are ignorant about plant breeding using modern biotechnology and mistake improved plant varieties such as hybrids with GMOs.Thus scientists at NaCRRI have put in efforts to sensitise school children right from primary to university level by organising essay competitions where the students are required to search for information about application of modern biotechnology in plant breeding. The 6th edition of the essay competition awardees were given certificates, plaques, laptops and a one-week internship training at NaCRRI.This was the first time most of the competing students were visiting the research institute and its laboratory where tissue culture cassava breeding is being done by breeding them in tests tubes. The students were also amazed to see tissue culture cassava growing from test tubes to a full plant in the field.Enlightened Nasubuga was excited to receive her award and promised to sensitise fellow students at her school and other communities on the importance of scientists using emerging technologies to breed crops. I do not see any difference between improved cassava, maize and rice varieties with the traditional varieties being tested at the institute. I have heard that many Ugandans are opposed to improved crop varieties but it seems people lack knowledge about what the scientists are doing,  she asserted. Students submitted essays under the topic modern Biosciences to produce better nutritious food while Nsubuga focused on breeding of improved crop varieties to make nutritious food citing orange sweet potato and cassava which is bred conventionally and pro vitamin A treangenic banana which contains Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.She is optimistic that she will encourage fellow students to read scientific books to get knowledge especially in Biosciences be it in crop breeding of applied science to developing vaccines and drugs in the health sector.For Marvin Steven Nsubuga, the overall winner in the tertiary and university category, this is his third time participating in the awards. He submitted his first essay in 2015 when he was a Senior Five student and won an accolade, a certificate and a one-week internship at the institute.Nsubuga, a first year Administrative Science student at Kyambogo University, researched on using applied modern biotechnology to breed crops which can be used as a raw material in order to boost the industrial sector. He focused on crops such cassava which farmers will be able to grow and get high yields which can be supplied to brewing industries.  The starch can also be used to process glue and highly processed cassava flour used by industries processing confectionary products. I am currently disseminating this information for government to make good policy,  he noted.On his third time competing, Nsubuga scooped a certificate, plaque, a laptop and a one week internship at the institute. More student researchHe is encouraging university students to be in search of scientific information, especially in agricultural science where scientists are breeding crops to address challenges of climate change and devising ways of feeding the growing population in the world.National Agricultural Research Organisation board chairman, Prof Joseph Obua, urged students to pursue science subjects because science is a driver and engine of economic growth of all nations. I am urging teachers to use the best methods when teaching science subjects; make it simple and practical. This is because children tend to shy away from science subjects because teachers are using complex words which scare them. It is important to simplify the words for students to appreciate science, technology and innovations,  he noted.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Essay-challenge-brings-students-knowledge-biotechnology-life-/688336-5101200-d2t4y2z/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post41.png
39,Startup tips crucial to vocational students - Daily Monitor,"One of the major challenges vocational graduates face is lack of start-up capital despite being trained to be job creators not seekers. This sometimes forces them to end up in the job seekers pool which their training was trying to avoid.For a long time, Sophie Joyce Laker, a Fashion and Design student at Kitgum Technical Institute, would worry about starting a business citing lack of money. What Laker did not know though, was that mindset is the first capital and for as long as one s brain is functional, they can do anything they set out to do. She also came to learn that an entrepreneur must not keep complaining about challenges such as rent and delays in supplies but rather always devise solutions. The Fashion and Design student has since started a business; Rwot-Twero Workshop in Kitgum Town. But it was not until the Skills for Life programme recently that Laker realised all this and more about mentorship in business.Thirty youthful entrepreneurs from Kitgum Technical Institute and Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute in Gulu, received training in business start-ups and expansion skills from Enterprise Uganda experts, to ensure their dreams are realised. Subsequent follow-up visits to measure their progress coupled with mentorship have been ongoing since. Funded by Uganda Breweries (UBL), this expert training and mentoring under the Skills for Life programme aims at avoiding this. Launched in 2001, the programme has so far seen more than 114 scholarships awarded to academically deserving yet economically disadvantaged students with the aim of curbing youth unemployment and high school dropouts.The problemUganda s small and medium scale businesses are estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000; employing 2.5 million people (about 90 per cent of private sector jobs) and contributing about 20 per cent to the country s Gross Domestic Product, while producing 80 per cent of manufactured output. In fact, studies have ranked Uganda as one of the most entrepreneurial nations in the world. However, the business failure rate is equally high   standing at more than 50 per cent. This is due to various challenges, including lack of financial support and vital skills including entrepreneurial, management, marketing and financial planning. Other challenges include lack of business records, low corporate governance, poor banking and borrowing history, a culture that disrespects business contracts, fierce local and international competition and limited access to business development services.In fact Anjijuka Narasi Kambaho, the senior information and communication officer at Uganda Business and Technical Examinations Board, says starting personal businesses is not always easy for vocational trained graduates. There are expenses involved including purchasing the necessary equipment, paying rent and the required licenses needed for operation. Sometimes people want to first get formal jobs in order save and accumulate money for starting their own businesses later,  he says.Registered successAt Enterprise Uganda, a public-private institution aimed at promoting SMEs as the main vehicle for expanding production, providing sustainable jobs and enhancing economic growth, the Acholi youth are likely to avoid falling on the wayside like many similar businesses countrywide.  The mindset and entrepreneurship training model is an effective standard in transforming the behaviour of participants and triggering the desired action to start a business. This is corroborated by the statistic where 26 out of the 30 students actually started business after the December 2018 training, representing a 87 per cent success rate,  says Rosemary Mutyabule, the lead trainer. One such students is Nelson Mandela, of Daniel Comboni Vocational Institute who believes his poultry business can help him contribute to his family and community. Located in Custom-Corner Village, Layibi Division in Gulu municipality, Mandela s farm has 235 22-days old broiler chicks, fully vaccinated in line with the requirements from the trainers. During a visit to assess his business last month, it was discovered that Mandela, who mainly sells to roadside chicken roasters in Gulu Town feels his enterprise is delivering tangible benefits. He has earned Shs1.9m in chicken sales from his first stock giving him a profit of Shs300,000.  This poultry business is giving me a sense of purpose in life. I even sell the chicken droppings and earn at least Shs5,000 every 100kg sack,  Mandela says. Paul Otim, a Gulu-based business counsellor and mentor, who assessed Mandela s farm, believes, that though new, the enterprise has great potential to grow given the market opportunities available and the determination of the young entrepreneur.  A planned farm exposure visit will undoubtedly reinforce his potential to develop the business, especially on technical methods of handling the poultry, cost saving using local resources plus proper records management,  says Otim. Follow-upBroadly, the Skills for Life programme does not stop at the training or skilling phase, but the beneficiaries undergo various follow-up visits by the implementers who ensure the trainees  learning and development is in fulfillment of the programme s objectives.The latest additions to this initiative are 20 students of Kabale s African College of Commerce and Technology and another 20 from Datamine Institute in Kampala for whom UBL has provided up to about Shs115m to cover tuition for their second year of study, entrepreneurship training as well as seed capital for those that would have excelled in the programme.And for Sunday Auma Okee, an Electrical Systems and Maintenance student at Kitgum Technical Institute, the scholarship, aside from helping him stay in school, has helped him learn to start a business with what he has and in fact his dream of opening an electrical workshop seems closer. Interventions Edward Asiimwe, the principal at Uganda Rural Development and Training institute, says policy makers, the government in particular needs to support vocational training at all levels.  Just like in other education sectors, increased funding and investment is also mandatory in vocational institutions.  In addition, Asiimwe believes that students need to be continuously given the proper career guidance to enable them make better informed academic choices.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Startup-tips-crucial-vocational-students/688336-5101216-aaicob/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post42.png

The problem with universal primary education schools is that the population in class is too high. It is possible to find more than 200 pupils in one class. Private schools have a small teacher to pupil ratio. You will find 50 pupils in a class which is manageable. A child in a class of many pupils will not learn anything and might take long to understand,  Byaruhanga says. In 1997, government introduced Universal Primary Education. Under this arrangement, four children in every family were to study free of charge in all government-aided primary schools. Almost 10 years after UPE, the government introduced Universal Secondary Education becoming the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to introduce universal secondary education. But despite this, parents are increasingly parting with huge sums of money to educate their children in private schools. As such numbers of private schools increase each year.According to the Uganda Schools Guide website, as of today there are more than 13,000 private schools in 127 districts in Uganda. Among the private schools are the high end ones that offer foreign curriculums and target wealthy parents and the ones that target middle income earners. The endless challenges plaguing most public schools have increasingly eroded public confidence. They have been labelled as for the  poor  forcing some parents to take children to private schools where they hope to find better education for their children.The increase in enrollment of students has not only accelerated a rise in private schools across the country; but also the cost of education. Overwhelming numbersIn January 2018, Alex Kakooza, the permanent secretary of Ministry of Education and Sports while at the Senior One selection exercise at Uganda Manufacturers Association grounds announced that government had scrapped Universal Secondary Education in private schools under the Public Private Partnership (PPP). At the peak was a challenge of funding and an increasing number of ghost students. This did not go down well with parents who had fear of transferring their children to public schools for the USE programme dreading the appalling conditions of overcrowding. For instance, at Masindi Secondary School, a government funded school, students study in shifts; some in the morning to noon while others from 2pm to evening. According to Byaruhanga,  Some parents take their children to UPE schools because the tuition is relatively lower there. Personally I do not have much money but I want my children to at least have a good education. I would rather pay in installments to make sure that my children study in a private school. But the move to scrap USE from private schools was intended to raise money and ensure that every sub county has a public school. According to Kakooza, more than 615 government sub-counties had no secondary schools. At the time, government would pay Shs47,000 for each student per term in a private school under the USE programme. Mpumudde Seed Secondary School in Jinja District is one of the new schools established by government to create equity in providing education across the country. However, since its establishment, the school is still housed in Mpumudde Primary School buildings with a few new classroom blocks. Sanon Mwesigwa, the head teacher, recently expressed worry over a surging student population with no facilities while at the launch of a digital library at the school.  We want to appreciate e-learning, but we do not have space where to put this digital library. My teachers have nowhere to sit because the staffroom is now full of digital tablets,  he said.  We want extra building materials and land for expansion and creation of access roads and a laboratory with chemicals and equipment,  he added.Aggrey Kibenge, the undersecretary at the Ministry of Education and Sports who was the chief guest at the event gave a one worded response.  We shall look into the matter at the ministry.  High price to pay With appalling conditions in both public primary and secondary schools, private schools have been increasing over time to attend to the needs of frustrated parents but at a much higher cost.According to the ministry of Education, the Private Schools and Institutions department was inaugurated in 2008, consequent to the restructuring of the ministry to cater for the ever expanding private investment in education. Since the government decision to liberalise the education sector in 1993, thousands of schools and institutions have been set up by private investors. In the secondary sub-sector, the number of private schools, at about 4,000, is more than double the number of government-funded schools. Light Academy on Entebbe road is one such private school that specifically cater for the middle class who can afford the fees. Mahad Budda, a student at Light Academy (former Turkish), says the school charges between Shs1.8m and Shs2m per term and the fees increase termly. However, he says, the services are worth the money because the teacher-student ratio is low with each class stream having between 28 and 32 students. He adds that the sickbay is good with fulltime nurses as well as better accommodation.Other private schools around Kampala and Wakiso districts charge between Shs500,000 and Shs2m as tuition fees for either day or boarding section. Scraped fundingAt the start of 2018, the ministry of Education scrapped funding to 792 private secondary schools which had been implementing the Universal Secondary Education programme. The ministry officials argued that the government has built capacity over the years in areas where they did not have any government-aided schools and are now ready to absorb those students in these institutions, adding that this, however, will be done in phases. The move left an estimated number of students who were expected to benefit from the Public Private Partnership in Senior One stranded.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/private-schools-children-UPE-a-laboratory-parents/688336-5112742-11d5ivi/index.html,/static/img-2019-05-22/post43.png
41,The right time to get a master s degree - Daily Monitor,"There is an increase in the number of universities in the country, making it easy for one to acquire qualifications. And as such many young people are going for graduate studies soon after their undergraduate qualifications, and as with many issues, this, too, has its advantages and disadvantages. Before Rosta Asiimwe completed her undergraduate degree in Human Nutrition, she had applied for a Masters in Public Health Nutrition.  I worked on-and-off for five months with research organisations. That little experience motivated me to take my master s degree seriously. Previously, I was just going through the motions but then I became interested in research. Besides, the pay is good in research work. The advantage of rushing into a postgraduate programme early is that you are still young and have the time to concentrate. On the downside, you tend to continue in the same course you began at undergraduate level. Gaining work experience opens the mind to a variety of career choices. The merits of growing your career first Spending a few years in the work arena can help a person focus their career goals. Grace Kenganzi, who has a Bachelor s degree in Mass Communication, undertook a postgraduate in Media and Communications after working for more than three years in a media house.  By that time, I was sure of the experience I wanted to attain   the kind that I could not get from my workplace. I had majored in public relations in my undergraduate course and since I worked for a media organisation, I had learnt on the job. I was more deliberate as I looked for a postgraduate course; I did not want just any media course because in the future, I want to branch into communication,  said Kenganzi.Samuel Bakutana, the chief executive officer Inspired Leaders International, says by concentrating on growing a career, a person comes to terms with the real demands of the job world, instead of making up their mind based on what they are told in the lecture room.  The working experience gives you a more mature perspective. By the time I went for my Master s in Leadership, I was already aware of the glaring gaps, the available opportunities and the needs of my future work. I approached the studies with a more mature, sober and committed attitude,  he says, adding:  A working background enables you relate with the programme content at a more real, practical and personal level because you have gone through the scenarios (or have examples to draw from) being presented in the course materials as you progressively apply the new or renewed learning. The financial questionWhen you are younger, chances of getting a scholarship are higher than if you are above 35 years. However, all is not bleak.  There are specialised programmes, for example The Chevening Scholarship Programme, that only gives scholarships to people who have careers,  Kenganzi says, adding,  You can only know about them when you are working. If I studied my postgraduate much earlier, I would not have thought of studying abroad or applying for a scholarship. Generally, because a master s degree can be expensive and students may be uncertain about what they want to do with their lives, students should gain some real-world experience before beginning a master s degree programme.Fitting into the labour marketEmployers are comfortable employing someone who already has job experience because, from a purely financial perspective, training of new staff is expensive and may not pay off immediately. Kenganzi believes her work experience and her master s degree gives her an edge.  I know what I want and I will ask for it. I cannot just accept anything thrown my way.  Asiimwe is not so confident.  Getting a job will be quite tricky. In the Ugandan (labour) market, (work) experience is the password and I know those who have it have an advantage over me.
