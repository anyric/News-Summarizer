0,Bouteflika ally named Algeria's first new president in 20 years - Daily Monitor,"Algerian lawmakers appointed a regime stalwart as the country's first new president in two decades Tuesday, dismaying protesters seeking sweeping change following the resignation of veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The election of upper house speaker Abdelkader Bensalah as interim president follows constitutional rules but goes against the demands of demonstrators, who have pushed for him and other top politicians to stand down.""I want to work towards fulfilling the interests of the people,"" Bensalah, a trusted ally of Bouteflika, told parliament on taking up the 90-day interim presidency.""It's a great responsibility that the constitution demands of me,"" the 77-year-old added.Opposition parties refused to back the appointment of the seasoned establishment insider and boycotted the session, as thousands of students protested against him in Algiers.""Resign Bensalah!"" they chanted, clutching hand-written placards and Algerian flags.For the first time in seven weeks police in the capital fired tear gas to try to disperse the protest by students, who were also hit with water cannon.On Friday -- in the first weekly mass protest since Bouteflika announced his departure after losing the military's support -- Algerians demanded regime insiders be excluded from the political transition.Ahead of the parliamentary session, an editorial in pro-government daily El Moudjahid on Tuesday suggested Bensalah should step aside from the presidential post.He is ""not tolerated by the citizen movement, which demands his immediate departure,"" or by the opposition and various political groups in both houses of parliament, the newspaper said.- 'Voice of the people' -Three men in particular have drawn demonstrators' ire: Bensalah, the head of the constitutional council Tayeb Belaiz and prime minister Noureddine Bedoui.The protest movement is calling for a new transitional framework that is committed to deep reforms and organising free elections.Ahead of Bensalah's appointment, calls continued for the speaker to step down.""He has to resign, it's the voice of the people and the people must be right,"" said 50-year-old Mourad, an entrepreneur who will protest Friday with his two young daughters.""They don't know that there's democracy... I want to teach them what freedom is,"" he added.Algerians of all ages have rallied since late February against Bouteflika, who resigned a week ago after efforts to appease demonstrators proved fruitless.Although the 82-year-old's resignation was celebrated by protesters, they have remained firm in pushing for a wider overhaul of the political system.Human Rights Watch said Bouteflika's departure is ""at most a first step in ending autocratic rule.""""During any transitional phase, authorities should fully respect the rights of Algerians to speak, assemble and associate with one another,"" the watchdog said in a statement.Demonstrators in huge numbers have defied a protest ban in Algiers, and HRW on Tuesday called on authorities to overhaul laws ""on association and assembly that stifle rights.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Bouteflika-ally-named-Algeria-s-first-new-president-20-years/688340-5063880-euwet5/index.html
1,School heads in Kinkiizi Diocese face demotion over poor grades - Daily Monitor,"Kanungu. Head teachers in Church of Uganda-founded primary schools in Kinkiizi Diocese that fail to register pupils in Division One this academic year will be demoted, Bishop Dan Zoreka has said. Non-performing head teachers will be demoted to classroom teachers because the diocese shall not tolerate them in the education department as team leaders. You either take charge and improve academic performance or go back to classroom as teachers. Work in silence and let success make noise,  Bishop Zoreka said yesterday.He was addressing head teachers, chairpersons of Parents Teachers Association and their school management committee chairpersons in Kanungu District.Statistics issued by Rev Stella Arineitwe, the education secretary of Kinkiizi Diocese, indicate that out of 2,475 pupils from 83-church founded primary schools in Kanungu that sat for Primary Leaving Examinations last year, only 123 passed in first grade.Mr Emmy Ngabirano, the deputy Resident District commissioner, said they are ready to support proposals on improving academic standards. The system of recycling and transferring head teachers that have failed to register pupils passing in grade one shall not be entertained. If you feel that you are tired, just request for early retirement and let people that are fresh and dynamic take the leadership positions you are currently occupying,  Mr Ngabirano said. How come Senior Four and Six dropouts teaching in private schools make pupils pass in grade one despite the small salaries they get and you that are being well paid by government fail to make it   he added.Ms Josephine Katsya, the district chairperson, said poor academic performance in government schools in the area is worrying.She said in the next 10 years, the district might not raise technical personnel to work in their own district because many students drop out of school before completing Senior Four.Mr Charles Sunday, the district education officer, warned head teachers against absenteeism, saying it interferes with the learning procedure. He wondered why teachers in government are not performing well. There is need for a by-law banning proprietors of private schools from taking away bright pupils in government schools after promising heaven and earth to their parents because such trends sabotage Universal Primary Education,  Mr Sunday said.Mr John Tereraho, an education consultant with World Vision, called for team work to improve academic performance.Mr Kenneth Tusingwire, the head teacher for Nyakatare Primary School, called for increase in teachers  welfare by providing them with meals and other incentives if performance is to improve. I worked at Kihiihi Primary School and the academic standards were the best in the district because parents agreed to raise extra money to motivate teachers. I am sure that if this is done, performance will improve,  Mr Tusingwire said.ConcernsOther head teachers cited absenteeism of pupils, teachers staying at one station for long, poor administrators, neglect by the foundation bodies, lack of staff accommodation and negative attitude on UPE schools by parents among others, as the major causes of poor performance. They suggested that sensitisation of all stake holders, especially being reminded of their respective roles would change the situation.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/School-heads-Kinkiizi-Diocese-face-demotion-over-poor-grades/688334-5063780-c1ln5h/index.html
2,Gunmen shoot two in mobile money robbery - Daily Monitor,"Two unidentified gunmen on Sunday night shot and injured two people in Mpongo Village in Mpasana Sub-county in Kakumiro District before taking off with unspecified amount of money from a mobile money agent.The men, who were riding on a motorcycle at about 10:30pm, attacked a mobile money agent whom police identified as Mr Amos Mugisha and robbed him of money and his mobile phone before they attacked another shop attendant. Mr Najib Waiswa, the district police commander, identified the injured as Mr Kussein Kasaija, 42, and Mr Posoko Sekiwere, 23, all residents of Mpongo and Mukora villages, respectively.  They pointed a gun at me and asked me to give them all the money that I had. I gave them Shs.1.3 million. They proceeded to the next shop where I heard them firing bullets,   Mr Mugisha said. Eyewitnesses say the armed men attempted to rob another businesswoman but failed.Her son, Mr Sekiwere, engaged the robbers in a scuffle prompting them to shoot him, police said.

3,"Help local communities benefit from tourism, experts tell government - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government should find innovative ways of helping communities around protected areas earn from tourism if they are to appreciate and protect the parks, experts have suggested.Dr Dilys Roe, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), a London-based think-tank, said if communities feel that parks do not benefit them, they resort to poaching.She made the remarks while giving a keynote address into the threats to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and some innovative ideas for new community-based solutions in Kampala last week. The lecture was organised by Aga Khan Development Network. Citing their nearly two years  experience in helping communities around Bwindi tap into tourism, Dr Roe said many people can benefit from gorilla tracking indirectly through selling items to tourists. Gorillas are key attraction in Uganda. They are particularly important because there aren t many countries in the world where you can find gorillas. So the tourism market is here or in Rwanda,  she said.  That really sounds positive, but the other side of the story is where that money goes. Dr Roe said local communities can earn from tourism if they are trained to work as professional guides, sell food or offer authentic cultural experiences and not necessarily wait for the 10 per cent park revenue ploughed back by government. TrainingShe said IIED has already trained some residents to offer the services.Gorilla-tracking in Bwindi generates revenue for conservation, but local benefits from tourism are limited and the illegal use of the park s resources continues.Tourism is a top foreign exchange earner and Uganda last year raked in $1.4b (Shs5 trillion) from the sector, according to government statistics.Mr Amin Mawji, the Aga Khan Development Network representative in Uganda, said the lectures are aimed at creating  a space for conversation... a space for illumination where leaders and opinion formers can come together to reflect on the big issues of our time, to explore new ideas and fresh perspectives, and to promote new solutions to the problems that face us and our children. The lecture examined some of the challenges facing the tourism sector. Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, the Tourism minister, lauded the Aga Khan Development Network for organising the lecture and contributing to the development of Uganda.He said government is committed to conserving the environment but sometimes they are let down by rampant poverty among Ugandans, bad attitude and the growing population of people and animals that compete for space.The lecture was attended by Mr Daudi Migereko, the chairman of Uganda Tourist Board, several ambassadors and senior leadership of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Help-local-communities-benefit-from-tourism-experts-tell-govt/688334-5063750-gaoykg/index.html

7,"Remittances to developing world hit record in 2018, says World Bank - Daily Monitor","Money transfers to poor and developing countries hit a fresh record in 2018 and should become their largest source of external financing this year, the World Bank said Monday.But many banks and money transfer operators charged too much, cutting into the gains of migration, the bank said in a statement.Migrant workers and others sent home an estimated $529 billion to low- and middle-income countries last year, up 9.6 percent from the year before, which had also been a record.Such money transfers should hit $550 billion this year, making them the largest source of external finance, according to the bank.Money transfers were up 12 percent to $131 billion for South Asia and almost seven percent for East Asia, reaching $143 billion. Sub-Saharan Africa saw a 10 percent increase at $46 billion, according to the bank.The United States economy grew strongly while outbound flows from Gulf countries and Russia also rose, according to the bank, which said this explained much of the gains.Excluding China, the remittances amounted to $462 billion, significantly more than foreign direct investment over the period, which stood at $344 billion.Among the development goals set by the United Nations in 2015 was reducing the cost of remittances to three percent.However, banks on average were charging 11 percent in the first quarter of 2019 while post offices charged seven percent.""The high costs of money transfers reduce the benefits of migration,"" Dilip Ratha, the report's lead author, said in a statement.""Renegotiating exclusive partnerships and letting new players operate through national post offices, banks and telecommunications companies will increase competition and lower remittance prices.""Another factor making money transfer costs rise are banks' efforts to avoid money-laundering and terrorism finance.Some banks simply cease working with some money transfer organizations deemed too risky, according to the report.""Banks indicate that risks to their reputation... deter them from having correspondent bank accounts,"" it said.

The Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) party has said they will not join an Opposition coalition which does not have capacity to take over power from President Museveni.Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters in Najjanankumbi, Kampala, yesterday, Mr John Kikonyogo, the FDC deputy spokesperson, said they are determined to take power and cannot entertain people who promise a lot but deliver nothing.  All we want right now is to take over power. We are obsessed with power. These people who are peddling their coalition things should look for other people and not FDC,  Mr Kikonyogo said.His comments come after the signing of a memorandum of understanding between Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party and People s Development Party to form what they called a strong DP bloc last Friday.Also present were other Opposition leaders; Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu of Alliance for National Transformation and Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, of People Power, a pressure group, and Justice Forum party, among others.The Opposition leaders accused Dr Kizza Besigye, the FDC flag bearer in last elections, of always shunning partnerships which could breed a strong force to push President Museveni out of power. They also accused him of discouraging the public from participating in elections on account that polls will not bring the desired regime yet he continued contesting in the same exercise.Mr Kikonyogo said forming a coalition with weak parties would deny Ugandans the chance to choose what and whom they want.  We have tried this before and were disappointed. They always call us assuring us that we would get someone through consensus ... which is unfair. This is why we shall not accept this,  Mr Kikonyogo said.  We have now gone into a countrywide consultation. We want to see what the people want because last time when everyone saw Mr Amama [Mbabazi], they thought he was the messiah but in the end people voted for Dr Besigye,  he added. READ: I will keep fighting to reclaim my 2016 victory, says BesigyeIn 2016, the Opposition formed The Democratic Alliance (TDA) to choose one candidate to challenge President Museveni in the elections. Dr Besigye and former prime minister Amama Mbabazi were the front runners.However, both contested against Mr Museveni after TDA failed to make a pick. Recently, Dr Besigye said he pulled out of the TDA deal when he asked Mr Mbabazi on what strategy he had to stop the vote rigging by the ruling NRM party. Mr Mbabazi said he would reveal his plan after he had been elected the joint Opposition candidate.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/We-will-not-ally-with-weak-people-says-FDC/688334-5063600-lgq4m1/index.html

Since the protests erupted in December, the armed forces have remained on the sidelines even as security agents and riot police have cracked down.Demonstrators have called on the army to protect them from the deadly crackdown, after days of camping outside its headquarters, which also houses Bashir's residence and the defence ministry.Wish of the revolutionDefence Minister General Awad Ibnouf vowed that the army would prevent any slide into chaos.""Sudan's armed forces understand the reasons for the demonstrations and is not against the demands and aspirations of the citizens, but it will not allow the country to fall into chaos,"" Ibnouf said on Monday, according to the official SUNA news agency.In a separate statement, army chief of staff Kamal Abdelmarouf said the military was ""discharging its responsibility in securing and protecting citizens.""Officials say 38 people have died in protest-related violence since December.Interior Minister Bushara Juma said seven protesters died and 15 were wounded on Saturday when forces tried to disperse them.He said 42 security personnel were injured and 2,496 arrests made.The umbrella group spearheading the protests appealed to the army on Monday for talks on forming a transitional government.""We call on the Sudanese armed forces to talk directly with the Alliance for Freedom and Change for facilitating the peaceful process of forming a transitional government,"" said Omar el-Digeir, a senior member of the group.Digeir said the protest organisers had formed a council to open talks aimed at agreeing a ""transitional government that represents the wish of the revolution"".Reading from a statement, he also called on the armed forces ""to withdraw their support for a regime that has lost its legitimacy"" and to support the ""people's alternative for a transition to a civilian democratic government"".Economic mismanagement The rally outside the army headquarters has been the largest since protests began on December 19 in the central town of Atbara, quickly spreading to the capital and nationwide.The European Union said an ""unprecedented"" number of people had come out calling for change since Saturday.""The people of Sudan have shown remarkable resilience in the face of extraordinary obstacles over many years,"" the EU's External Action Service said.""Their trust must be won through concrete action by the government.""The protesters accuse Bashir's administration of economic mismanagement that has led to soaring food prices and chronic shortages of fuel and foreign currency.After a meeting chaired by Bashir on Sunday, Sudan's security council said the demands of the protesters ""have to be heard"".Bashir, wanted by the Hague-based International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide connected with the suppression of a now 16-year-old ethnic minority rebellion in the western region of Darfur, took power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.He has remained defiant, introducing tough measures that have seen protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists arrested.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Gun-fire-army-headquaters-Sudan-Omar-alBashir-protestors/688340-5063414-uk3vehz/index.html

The government has warned of impending famine in most parts of the country, cautioning traders to limit food exports and families to start food rationing.Mr Christopher Kibanzanga, the State minister for Agriculture, issued the warning in an interview with Daily Monitor yesterday.He attributed the looming famine to the delayed rain and drought that has stretched beyond March into April resulting in crop failure. We are certainly not going to have enough food. Our appeal to farmers is not to take everything to the market,  Mr Kibanzanga said. Traders should take [sell] food to areas like eastern Uganda, northern Uganda and Karamoja sub-region which do not have food,  he added.Mr Kibanzanga said government will support mini and large scale irrigation schemes across the country to minimise over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture as it is done currently.At the beginning of March, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA), the government agency for weather forecast, predicted that most parts of the country would receive plenty of rainfall. They said farmers were free to start planting their crops. The forecast followed some occasional showers that enticed farmers to start planting crops, but the skies soon dried up and crops wilted under the scorching sunshine.Mr Festus Luboyera, the UNMA executive director, later issued a statement attributing the current dry spell conditions to the tropical cyclone which last month ravaged Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Madagascar and left an estimated 1,000 people dead. The cyclone led to the development of low pressure system around the Mozambique channel which resulted in the weakening of southeasterly trade winds. These winds became diverted towards the channel, depriving moisture laden winds to reach our country which is why we have experienced the dry spells,  Mr Luboyera said in a statement. Ms Agnes Kirabo, the executive director of Food Rights Alliance, a civil society organisation, said government should be blamed for failing to store produce of the previous season. There was a dramatic bumper harvest but most of the grain, which would have been used in this bad season was wasted,  she said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Prepare-for-famine--government-tells-Ugandans/688334-5062732-daumc3/index.html
13,Dedicated to pupils with special needs - Daily Monitor,"Maria Nansubuga Galiwango was supposed to be a journalist. That is what she longed for as a child. She thought that each of her days would be filled with an adventure of travelling to new places.Instead, after completing Senior Four, her elder brother encouraged her to become a teacher because of her love for children. That was the turning point as Nansubuga joined Gaba Teachers College where she graduated with a certificate in primary school teaching. It was the beginning of the journey into the unknown. She got a job at a school that she never thought would change her life forever.Tough startIn 2012, Nansubuga joined Hill Preparatory School, Naguru, kickstarting her journey in teaching.  I was given an inclusion class but that was a big challenge,  the 32-year-old said.An inclusive class has learners with disabilities and special education learning alongside their non-disabled peers. I had no interest at first. I was even afraid but after prayer I realised that this was a special group of people God had allowed me to reach,  Nansubuga recalls.As we sat for the interview, the love from the children was evident. A couple of them played with her while some hugged her, interrupting the session at several stages.Getting into the grooveA multi-talented teacher, Nansubuga later completed her diploma at Uganda Martyrs University-Nkozi in 2015 courtesy of the school director Clare Wavamunno and head teacher Ambrose Kibuuka. She attended several school trainings at Lugogo in Kampala which were regularly organised by Special Olympics Uganda as well as Umoja Global Community Music Therapy. The British Council also offered her an opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom in 2014 during an exchange programme to improve her skills of teaching special needs children.  I picked interest in furthering my knowledge of special needs education because I found these children amazing. They are so loving and I started seeing Jesus in them,  she said.Another dimensionNansubuga who teaches English and Mathematics, currently conducts private lessons at the convenience of the parents  homes for the last one year.Although she left Hill last year, she still goes there to conduct swimming lessons on a private arrangement.Nansubuga said she is now married to teaching even though she opted to start her private classes which she says offered her greener pastures. There are some parents who are still not comfortable bringing their special needs children in public and I find that an opportunity to reach out to them and help them develop,  she said.Nansubuga said she chose that approach because it is exciting yet she has a passion for seeing children with special needs excel. For special needs children, there s something new everyday, she says. They are fun and can be a challenge sometimes especially children with intellectual disabilities but we get to know each other. Nansubuga believes a good special needs educator is someone who has a passion for what they teach, and who you teach.  Being flexible and passionate is something I take pride in as an educator. I constantly talk to them to be able to build self-esteem. She was forced into swimming to tame autistic children who are normally hyper, especially after lunch making it necessary to curb extra energy.The common intellectual disability cases she has handled include; autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Each of those cases are handled differently and that is the best lesson I have learned in life. Everyone is different from the other,  she notes, adding that loving such children is what makes us human.Moving onNansubuga agrees that she cannot get all the money she needs from teaching as such she handles different projects. After opting to leave Hill Preparatory School last year, she joined Kampala International Pre-School in Naguru before she settled at Bourneville International School. She supplements this by working in a network marketing company, Success, which deals in cryptocurrencies. I do personal work with Success online and I never have to worry about my teaching appointments,  she says about her balancing act.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Dedicated-pupils-with-special-needs/688336-5060824-glwrmwz/index.html
14,NTCs should offer computer courses - Daily Monitor,"Despite computer being one of the subjects taught in schools today, several National Teacher s College (NTCs) across the country do not conduct these courses for their students. As such several stakeholders in the education sector have called on the Education ministry to consider having in place computer courses to produce teachers who can impart computer education to the learners. Last year, National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), recommended that computer studies must be taught at both O and A-Level.In fact Denis Tabo, a former student of Gulu Central High School told Daily Monitor that limited access to computer labs, and lack of computer books was the reason why students performed dismally in computer exams in the 2018-2019 national exams. We used to access computer lab twice a week for only 80 minutes a day which is not enough for a student to practice,   he said. He also cited lack of computer books that has made most of the students fail the theory part of the computer exams due to limited books in various schools. But Michael Okidi, the head teacher Layibi High School, advised schools to take up computer lessons when they already have in place enough computers and well-trained computer teachers. Lack of professional teachers is forcing us to hire anybody with a Bachelors in Computer Science some of whom are not equipped with the right knowledge of teaching students,  he said. Charles Nyakito, the principal Unyama NTC, said computer studies are not yet in their curriculum.  We have been advocating for Kyambogo University to substitute Typewriting course with computer studies but we are not yet successful,  Nyakito said. Currently, only Business Education students at Unyama NTC are taught computer, which is a small group,  he adds.Decrying the status quo, Ronald Lukyamuzi, the vice chairman Information and Communication Technology Teachers Association of Uganda, said most of the members of the association are not professional teachers but university ICT and Computer Science graduates.  Government should also equip all the schools teaching computer studies with computers. Most schools have only about five computers which are shared by 60 students and no projector to support teachers in class,  he said. Computer studies were included in secondary school syllabus to encourage practical work and skills to allow students to accommodate the changing technologies in ICT.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/NTCs-should-offer-computer-courses/688336-5060874-jfktjhz/index.html
15,Bouteflika ally named Algeria's first new president in 20 years - Daily Monitor,"Algerian lawmakers appointed a regime stalwart as the country's first new president in two decades Tuesday, dismaying protesters seeking sweeping change following the resignation of veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The election of upper house speaker Abdelkader Bensalah as interim president follows constitutional rules but goes against the demands of demonstrators, who have pushed for him and other top politicians to stand down.""I want to work towards fulfilling the interests of the people,"" Bensalah, a trusted ally of Bouteflika, told parliament on taking up the 90-day interim presidency.""It's a great responsibility that the constitution demands of me,"" the 77-year-old added.Opposition parties refused to back the appointment of the seasoned establishment insider and boycotted the session, as thousands of students protested against him in Algiers.""Resign Bensalah!"" they chanted, clutching hand-written placards and Algerian flags.For the first time in seven weeks police in the capital fired tear gas to try to disperse the protest by students, who were also hit with water cannon.On Friday -- in the first weekly mass protest since Bouteflika announced his departure after losing the military's support -- Algerians demanded regime insiders be excluded from the political transition.Ahead of the parliamentary session, an editorial in pro-government daily El Moudjahid on Tuesday suggested Bensalah should step aside from the presidential post.He is ""not tolerated by the citizen movement, which demands his immediate departure,"" or by the opposition and various political groups in both houses of parliament, the newspaper said.- 'Voice of the people' -Three men in particular have drawn demonstrators' ire: Bensalah, the head of the constitutional council Tayeb Belaiz and prime minister Noureddine Bedoui.The protest movement is calling for a new transitional framework that is committed to deep reforms and organising free elections.Ahead of Bensalah's appointment, calls continued for the speaker to step down.""He has to resign, it's the voice of the people and the people must be right,"" said 50-year-old Mourad, an entrepreneur who will protest Friday with his two young daughters.""They don't know that there's democracy... I want to teach them what freedom is,"" he added.Algerians of all ages have rallied since late February against Bouteflika, who resigned a week ago after efforts to appease demonstrators proved fruitless.Although the 82-year-old's resignation was celebrated by protesters, they have remained firm in pushing for a wider overhaul of the political system.Human Rights Watch said Bouteflika's departure is ""at most a first step in ending autocratic rule.""""During any transitional phase, authorities should fully respect the rights of Algerians to speak, assemble and associate with one another,"" the watchdog said in a statement.Demonstrators in huge numbers have defied a protest ban in Algiers, and HRW on Tuesday called on authorities to overhaul laws ""on association and assembly that stifle rights.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Bouteflika-ally-named-Algeria-s-first-new-president-20-years/688340-5063880-euwet5/index.html
16,School heads in Kinkiizi Diocese face demotion over poor grades - Daily Monitor,"Kanungu. Head teachers in Church of Uganda-founded primary schools in Kinkiizi Diocese that fail to register pupils in Division One this academic year will be demoted, Bishop Dan Zoreka has said. Non-performing head teachers will be demoted to classroom teachers because the diocese shall not tolerate them in the education department as team leaders. You either take charge and improve academic performance or go back to classroom as teachers. Work in silence and let success make noise,  Bishop Zoreka said yesterday.He was addressing head teachers, chairpersons of Parents Teachers Association and their school management committee chairpersons in Kanungu District.Statistics issued by Rev Stella Arineitwe, the education secretary of Kinkiizi Diocese, indicate that out of 2,475 pupils from 83-church founded primary schools in Kanungu that sat for Primary Leaving Examinations last year, only 123 passed in first grade.Mr Emmy Ngabirano, the deputy Resident District commissioner, said they are ready to support proposals on improving academic standards. The system of recycling and transferring head teachers that have failed to register pupils passing in grade one shall not be entertained. If you feel that you are tired, just request for early retirement and let people that are fresh and dynamic take the leadership positions you are currently occupying,  Mr Ngabirano said. How come Senior Four and Six dropouts teaching in private schools make pupils pass in grade one despite the small salaries they get and you that are being well paid by government fail to make it   he added.Ms Josephine Katsya, the district chairperson, said poor academic performance in government schools in the area is worrying.She said in the next 10 years, the district might not raise technical personnel to work in their own district because many students drop out of school before completing Senior Four.Mr Charles Sunday, the district education officer, warned head teachers against absenteeism, saying it interferes with the learning procedure. He wondered why teachers in government are not performing well. There is need for a by-law banning proprietors of private schools from taking away bright pupils in government schools after promising heaven and earth to their parents because such trends sabotage Universal Primary Education,  Mr Sunday said.Mr John Tereraho, an education consultant with World Vision, called for team work to improve academic performance.Mr Kenneth Tusingwire, the head teacher for Nyakatare Primary School, called for increase in teachers  welfare by providing them with meals and other incentives if performance is to improve. I worked at Kihiihi Primary School and the academic standards were the best in the district because parents agreed to raise extra money to motivate teachers. I am sure that if this is done, performance will improve,  Mr Tusingwire said.ConcernsOther head teachers cited absenteeism of pupils, teachers staying at one station for long, poor administrators, neglect by the foundation bodies, lack of staff accommodation and negative attitude on UPE schools by parents among others, as the major causes of poor performance. They suggested that sensitisation of all stake holders, especially being reminded of their respective roles would change the situation.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/School-heads-Kinkiizi-Diocese-face-demotion-over-poor-grades/688334-5063780-c1ln5h/index.html
17,Gunmen shoot two in mobile money robbery - Daily Monitor,"Two unidentified gunmen on Sunday night shot and injured two people in Mpongo Village in Mpasana Sub-county in Kakumiro District before taking off with unspecified amount of money from a mobile money agent.The men, who were riding on a motorcycle at about 10:30pm, attacked a mobile money agent whom police identified as Mr Amos Mugisha and robbed him of money and his mobile phone before they attacked another shop attendant. Mr Najib Waiswa, the district police commander, identified the injured as Mr Kussein Kasaija, 42, and Mr Posoko Sekiwere, 23, all residents of Mpongo and Mukora villages, respectively.  They pointed a gun at me and asked me to give them all the money that I had. I gave them Shs.1.3 million. They proceeded to the next shop where I heard them firing bullets,   Mr Mugisha said. Eyewitnesses say the armed men attempted to rob another businesswoman but failed.Her son, Mr Sekiwere, engaged the robbers in a scuffle prompting them to shoot him, police said. As they fled, residents mobilised and barricaded the road to prevent them from escaping but in the process, Mr Kasaija was shot.The injured were taken for first aid and later to Hoima referral hospital. Police say they have started investigating the matter.  We are in touch with local people and we shall bring the perpetrators to book,   Mr Waiswa said yesterday. In a related incident, police in Kagadi District are holding a woman and four other relatives in connection with the murder of her husband Vincent Sabimaana, a businessman in Kyabitundu Village in Rugashaali Sub-county. Sabimaana s body was found at the weekend.Police investigations and a post-mortem report shows that he was strangled to death.Mr Romeo Ojara Oneck, the district police commander, attributed the killing to domestic violence.ArrestsLast month, police said they arrested at least eight suspects in mobile money robberies and killings registered in four weeks in different districts. Police also said five suspects, who were targeting Savings and Credit Cooperative Organisations were apprehended. Police spokesperson Fred Enanga said robberies targeting mobile money operators and Saccos were registered between February 12 and March 7 in Wakiso, Busia, Mbale, Masaka, Kalungu and Mbarara districts in which two mobile money operators were shot dead.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Gunmen-shoot-two-in-mobile-money-robbery/688334-5063772-l9vynk/index.html
18,"Help local communities benefit from tourism, experts tell government - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Government should find innovative ways of helping communities around protected areas earn from tourism if they are to appreciate and protect the parks, experts have suggested.Dr Dilys Roe, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), a London-based think-tank, said if communities feel that parks do not benefit them, they resort to poaching.She made the remarks while giving a keynote address into the threats to the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and some innovative ideas for new community-based solutions in Kampala last week. The lecture was organised by Aga Khan Development Network. Citing their nearly two years  experience in helping communities around Bwindi tap into tourism, Dr Roe said many people can benefit from gorilla tracking indirectly through selling items to tourists. Gorillas are key attraction in Uganda. They are particularly important because there aren t many countries in the world where you can find gorillas. So the tourism market is here or in Rwanda,  she said.  That really sounds positive, but the other side of the story is where that money goes. Dr Roe said local communities can earn from tourism if they are trained to work as professional guides, sell food or offer authentic cultural experiences and not necessarily wait for the 10 per cent park revenue ploughed back by government. TrainingShe said IIED has already trained some residents to offer the services.Gorilla-tracking in Bwindi generates revenue for conservation, but local benefits from tourism are limited and the illegal use of the park s resources continues.Tourism is a top foreign exchange earner and Uganda last year raked in $1.4b (Shs5 trillion) from the sector, according to government statistics.Mr Amin Mawji, the Aga Khan Development Network representative in Uganda, said the lectures are aimed at creating  a space for conversation... a space for illumination where leaders and opinion formers can come together to reflect on the big issues of our time, to explore new ideas and fresh perspectives, and to promote new solutions to the problems that face us and our children. The lecture examined some of the challenges facing the tourism sector. Prof Ephraim Kamuntu, the Tourism minister, lauded the Aga Khan Development Network for organising the lecture and contributing to the development of Uganda.He said government is committed to conserving the environment but sometimes they are let down by rampant poverty among Ugandans, bad attitude and the growing population of people and animals that compete for space.The lecture was attended by Mr Daudi Migereko, the chairman of Uganda Tourist Board, several ambassadors and senior leadership of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Help-local-communities-benefit-from-tourism-experts-tell-govt/688334-5063750-gaoykg/index.html
19,"Apaa Land: Residents reject resettlement, compensation - Daily Monitor"," A section of residents occupying the disputed Apaa land bordering Amuru and Adjumani districts have rejected plans by the government to compensate and have them relocated.Government claims residents encroached on 827Sq km of gazetted former East Madi Controlled hunting area in Adjumani District.In February, Cabinet resolved to resettle victims of Apaa land conflict with building materials and money after assessing damages. According to a Cabinet memorandum, residents were to be given a package of Shs10 million, 20 iron sheets, 20 bags of cement and Shs2 million for those who do not have National Identity Cards. The processes of compensation and resettlement would be spear -headed by the Office of the Prime Minister, Lands ministry and Minister for Northern Uganda, Ms Grace Kwiyucwiny.The affected residents, however, say they will not accept any form of compensation and forceful plans to evict them from their ancestral land.Mr Sylvester Odoki, a resident of Acholi Ber Parish, says he totally disagrees with government plans to force them into accepting money and material benefits.Mr Denis Komakech, another Apaa resident, says the recent Cabinet memorandum was wrong on disclosing that only 374 families occupy Apaa land.Documents presented before Cabinet in February seen by this newspaper titled  The memorandum of Efforts to resolve the Apaa land conflict  indicated that 374 families occupy the land. A total of 206 were found to be non-violent and cooperative with government. According to the document, only 71 family heads were found with national IDs as residents of Apaa Village, Labala parish, Pabbo Sub-county in Amuru between 2013 and 2014 before the 2017 declaration of the boundary.However according to Mr Komakech, the information provided is inaccurate adding that more than 20,000 people are settling on the land.Last month, the Acholi legislators under their Umbrella body, the Acholi Parliamentary Group (APG), rejected the compensation plans.Mr Philip Okin Ojara, the APG chairperson, said the amount offered by government is too little for the residents to lose their land. Dr Daniel Komakech, the Acholi committee chairperson on Apaa land conflict, said the Cabinet resolution was made without consent from the team selected to ensure a peaceful resolution.Speaking during a meeting to discuss solutions on land conflict in Amuru and Nwoya districts at the Ker Kwaro Acholi Palace in Gulu Town on Thursday, Mr Komakech said the cabinet resolution was different from what they had discussed with the Prime Minister.In August last year, President Museveni called for the formation of an eight member committee from both Adjumani and Acholi to discuss the recommendations on ending the Apaa land impasse. The committee was headed by the Prime Minister, Dr Ruhakana Rugunda.However, in two meetings held between September and December last year and chaired by Dr Rugunda, the parties failed to harmonise on Mr Museveni s earlier recommendations.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Apaa-Land-Residents-reject-resettlement-compensation/688334-5062492-um0t30z/index.html
20,"Government, donors partner to restore wetlands - Daily Monitor","KABALE. The Ministry of Water and Environment with support from the World Bank Adaptation Fund through Sahara Sahel Observatory, a non-governmental organisation, has started a five-year project aimed at restoring wetlands in Maziba, Awoja and River Aswa catchment areas.Maziba catchment extends to Rubanda, Kabale, Rukiga and Ntungamo districts. Aswa stretches to districts of Kaabong, Kotido, Kitgum, Agago, Abim, Pader, Lira, Amuria, Otuke, Aleptong, Napak and Abim while Ajowa extends to Bukwo, Kween, Nakapiripiriti, Katakwi, Kumi, Serere, Soroti and Ngora districts.These three water catchment areas are alleged to have lost more than 70 per cent of the wetlands due to human intervention. While addressing the stakeholders in a meeting on Friday, Ms Annette Kezia Nantongo, a senior water officer with the Ministry of Water and Environment, said $7.75 million (about Shs29b) will be spent on the project.Ms Nantongo, who is also the project officer, said the drive aims at increasing the resilience of the surrounding communities to the risk of floods and landslides through promoting catchment based integrated, equitable and sustainable management of water and related resources. All these areas that we are targeting are prone to floods. People have depleted wetlands and the effects are visible. They are at a high risk of losing all the water resources in the area as well as facing desertification if the water catchments are invaded like they are now,  Ms Nantongo said.CoverageAwoja catchment covers 11,000 square kilometres; Aswa catchment covers 27,631 square kilometres while Maziba catchment covers 1,370 square kilometres.The project officials met district leaders, media and civil society organisations in Kabale to agree on the modalities of implementing the project in the region. District leaders, however, expressed concern that the project has up-bottom approach which may limit the impact.Kabale LC5 Patrick Besigye Kaihwa said while ministries come up with well written projects, they end up not being implemented because they lack local content. He said locals should be involved in all the processes. We want a project that shall have impact, many projects the ministries bring to us are designed and executed from the centre therefore lacking local content, the reason they at times fail. We now need to get fully involved and help our people because they are the ones affected by climate change in the end,  Mr Kaihwa said.The Ntungamo LC5 chairman, Mr Denis Singahache, who is also the chairperson of the Maziba catchment, asked the leaders in the area to embrace any project that comes to address climate change because it is negatively affecting their livelihood.Background 2013. Majority of the wetlands in Kabale District were degraded and turned into gardens and dairy farms, an official said.The then district wetlands coordinator, Mr Joseph Murangira, said the increasing population triggered the high demand for farming land.He added that soil exhaustion on hill tops and the recent introduction of tea growing in the district had escalated the situation. He said less than five wetlands out of the 72 that existed in 1980s that were in existence, adding that plans were underway to evict the encroachers.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-donors-partner-restore-wetlands/688334-5062532-132cc20/index.html
21,"Uganda, DR Congo unite to fight illegal wildlife trade - Daily Monitor","KABAROLE. In a bid to fight illegal wildlife trade and trafficking in Queen Elizabeth and Virunga national parks, Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through their wildlife authority bodies have embarked on trans-boundary collaboration to curb the vice.The wildlife authorities in Uganda include International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in partnership with the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA).IFAW is an international non-governmental organisation that protects animals and their habitants. The UWA deputy executive director, Mr George Owoyesigire, said Uganda is endowed with diverse natural resources such as wildlife, forests and wetlands, but poaching, illegal wildlife trade and habitat degradation remain threats. We have seen a serious decline in wildlife populations due to poaching and illegal wildlife trade,  he said.Mr Owoyesigire said this on Saturday at Koikoi in Fort Portal Town during a training of security and law enforcement officers within Queen Elizabeth and Virunga national parks on how to detect and combat illegal wildlife trade.He said due to the efforts, UWA with support from stakeholders are beginning to witness an increase in wild animals. For instance, elephant population decreased from 30,000 in 1960 to only 2,000 by 1983 and have since increased to 5,808 in 2017; buffalos were 60,000 in 1960 decreased to 25,000 in 1982 but have since increased to 37,054,  he said.Mr Owoyesigire said deforestation has had devastating effects on the forest cover from more than 30 per cent in 1990 to less than 9 per cent by 2019, wetland cover from more than 40 per cent in 1980 to less than 8 per cent by 2018. As a result of degradation, wild life in habitats have been destroyed, lakes have been depleted and that s the very reason we are experiencing an increase in human-wildlife conflicts, poverty and poaching as people strive to earn a living,  he said.The programmes director of IFAW, Mr Moses Olinga, said collaborating with the neighbouring country (DRC) will help in combating illegal wildlife trade easily.He said:  When animals cross from Uganda to DRC, they are killed because it is unknown where they belong. The border between Uganda and DRC has been used by poachers, and they have been killing animals from Uganda and they take them to DRC and vice versa.  He said pangolins have been the most poached animals because of their medicinal scales and therefore there is need for security agencies to get skills on how to identify scales of pangolins, skins of leopards, cheetahs, among others. People trying to smuggle chimps and other animals have been arrested at Entebbe, Jomo Kenyatta and Addis Ababa international airports  he added.Kabarole Resident District Commissioner Stephen Asiimwe appealed to UWA officials and other stakeholders to also domesticate laws such as the Wildlife Act and the constitution [explain the laws in local languages] because people are not informed.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Uganda-DR-Congo-unite-fight-illegal-wildlife-trade/688334-5062586-etnycb/index.html
22,Councillors raise queries over sold hospital equipment - Daily Monitor,"Kayunga. Councillors in Kayunga District have put the district executive committee on the spot over failure to show accountability of funds raised from the sale of old medical equipment at Kayunga General Hospital.The hospital is undergoing renovation and expansion at a cost of Shs70b. Dr Diana Atwine, the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Health, said the facility will be equipped with new machines upon completion.Although the council claims that they have not been informed about the funds raised, Mr Tom Sserwanga, the district chairperson, said about Shs210m has been collected from the exercise.Mr Jamir Ndugga, a councillor representing Kayonza Sub-county, said the district executive has utilised the funds without their approval. As council, we have not yet passed a supplementary budget to appropriate those funds, but we are shocked to learn that the executive has used it,  Mr Ndugga said at the weekend. When they wanted to sell off the medical equipment, they sought council approval, but when it comes to accountability, they dodge around, it means there is misappropriation and corruption tendencies,  he added.Some officials are also questioning the motive of the district executive to constitute another committee to handle the auctioning instead of the procurement and disposal unit. We were left out of this exercise (sale of equipment) and we are also watching from a distance,  an official from the procurement department, who preferred anonymity, said.Mr Sserwanga set up a verification team headed by Mr Charles Iga, the district fisheries officer, to dispose of the equipment.Mr Sserwanga categorised the funds from the sale as local revenue, saying they can be used in daily operations. The Shs210m is very little. We have so far used Shs42m to roof the theatre at Bbaale Health Centre IV. We wanted to do something tangible from these funds,  he said.Mr Sserwanga said they would show accountability to relevant authorities such as the Auditor General and Inspectorate of Government, adding that  we want to be as transparent as possible. Mr Benson Otim, the acting district chief administrative officer, also dismissed claims that the money had been misappropriated. Council has approved these funds to be used in fencing the district headquarters, buying furniture for the district chairperson and others,  Mr Otim said.He said the exercise is still ongoing and those who want accountability should wait for it to be concluded.Kayunga General Hospital, which was constructed in the 1970s, had never had any major renovations.Dr Sarah Opendi, the State minister for Health in-charge of General Duties, said government will delay the elevation of the hospital to a regional referral due to lack of funds. SoldSo far, the district has sold more than 700 aluminium iron sheets, hospital beds, mattresses and other equipment from the theatre among others. The renovation and expansion of the hospital is expected to be concluded by February next year.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Councillors-raise-queries-over-sold-hospital-equipment/688334-5062598-ijid1i/index.html
23,Increased  murder cases worry Bugisu  authorities - Daily Monitor,"Police and local leaders in Bugisu Sub-region have expressed concern over the increasing number of murder cases in the area.Police statistics indicate that more than 20 cases of murder were registered in Namisindwa, Manafwa, Mbale, Bududa, Bulambuli and Sironko districts between January and February this year.Police said the cases were a result of land wrangles, witchcraft, misunderstanding over inherited family property and business rivalry, among others.  We have registered a string of gruesome killings and this has caused fear among the locals. When family and clan members disagree on land and other properties, they resort to mob justice. When a family member is killed, the community also lynches culprits,  Mr Robert Tukei, the Elgon Region police spokesperson, said.He said Namisindwa tops in the cases followed by Mbale and Manafwa. Political and religious leaders, and community members should help us fight the crime in their respective districts,  Mr Tukei said.He said police have embarked on a massive community policing campaign to reduce cases of domestic violence and land wrangles. We have also intensified night patrols in all districts in the region to deal with the robbers,  he said.Police also say more than 30 cases of phone theft and 114 cases of other thefts were recorded in the two months.Mr George William Wopuwa, the Namisindwa chairperson, said they registered 20 deaths arising from either suicide or family-related murders, adding that many of the victims were more than 80 years of age. We have had community policing in many sub-counties but the trend continues.

24,Police foil theft of baby at Hoima regional hospital - Daily Monitor,"Hoima. Police in Hoima District have arrested a mother who had allegedly conspired with medical personnel to steal a baby from Hoima Regional Referral Hospital. According to police, the 21-year-old resident of Kiburwa Village in Kitoba Sub-county on Saturday at around 11pm allegedly made her way into the hospital and negotiated with two nurses to have her one-week old baby girl swapped with a baby boy of the same age.A whistle-blower, who heard of the plot, notified police, leading to the woman s arrest.According to preliminary information gathered by the police, one of the nurses on duty asked for Shs300,000 to execute the plan.  However, the suspect only had Shs80,000. She paid Shs50,000 and the balance was to be paid immediately after the deal had been effected. She was immediately arrested and taken to Hoima police,  said Mr Julius Hakiza, the Albertine region police spokesperson.Police detectives later visited the hospital for evidence gathering. They then contacted her husband. We do appeal to the mothers in hospitals to always be vigilant not to lose their new born babies. There are many people with ill intentions wandering in the hospitals. Always tip the nurses so that we can apprehend the culprits,  Mr Hakiza said. The hospital director, Dr Peter Mukobi, said they have increased security at the facility to prevent future thefts.Recent caseIn July last year, a child was stolen from Hoima Regional Referral Hospital from a Rwandan refugee. According to police detectives, the refugee from Kyangwali camp delivered by caesarean section under the help of medical workers at the hospital. Shortly after delivery a nurse on duty sent one of the mother s caretaker to pick a stretcher which would be used to transport the baby and the mother from the labour ward.By the time the caretaker returned, the baby had been taken and the nurse had disappeared.

25,"Agent quizzed, Hima to hand Tororo land back to locals - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Hima Cement has agreed to hand over land around Tororo rock back to the locals in Mwello Village after conceding that the company s agent acquired the land arbitrarily. Appearing before the land probe on Thursday, the Hima Cement managing director, Mr Nicolas George, conceded that their agent Optima Mining and Minerals had been placed under investigations because everything they did in Mwello was questionable. He said in the result, they suspended the quarrying project intended to start in Mwello.Appearing before the land probe on Friday, Mr Dunstan Ndyaguma, the managing director of Optima Mining and Minerals, was advised by the commission to get a lawyer to educate him on the land tenure system around Mwello rock in Tororo. The commission s lead counsel, Mr Ebert Byenkya, said Mr Ndyaguma did not know the land tenure system in Tororo where he was hired by Hima Cement to buy surface rights for the company on a 21-year lease. Hima Cement initially avoided buying the surface rights directly because brokers would inflate the price.The commission asked Mr Ndyaguma to explain the land system around Mwello rock and he said it s Mailo. Later, he contradicted himself saying it s Private Mailo. Earlier, the commission chairperson, Justice Catherine Bamugemereire, described Mr Ndyaguma as a dangerous man in matters related to land given how he manipulated the locals.  It s questionable how a company like Hima Cement can deal with a person like you. We are going to ask Hima Cement to come and explain,  Justice Bamugemereire said. Residents accused Mr Ndyaguma of handing them large sums of money in a bid to lure them to sell their land to him. During cross-examination, Mr Byenkya said Mr Ndyaguma bought land from locals who have a permanent ownership and intended to apply for a lease on the land from Tororo District Land Board. Mr Ndyaguma was informed that for such acquisitions to be legitimate the people selling the land must have a customary certificate on the land, which was not the case. Residents of eight villages in Mwello parish want the land probe to stop Hima Cement from buying their communal land without compensation. Mr Ndyaguma concurred with the former Commissioner for Geological Surveys and Mines, Mr Edward Kato, who told the land probe that Hima Cement did not have a mining licence but a three-year exploration permit.

26,Njeru taps run dry as water crisis persists - Daily Monitor,"Buikwe. The water scarcity, which has lasted for two months in Njeru Central and Nyenga divisions in Njeru Municipality, Buikwe District, has pushed the price of water to Shs2,000 per jerrycan.This has forced residents in the area to trek long distances coupled with spending many hours at wells as water shortage worsens.Some of the villages experiencing water shortage include Kyabagu, Naava, Namwezi, Lugazi II, Ntinda, Kafunta, Buzzika, Bukaya and Kiryowa.Ms Nusra Nansubuga, a resident of Kyabagu Village, on Saturday said despite trekking long distances to get water, it is also very expensive. She said sometimes, it becomes hard to get water since people are always many at wells on the banks of River Nile.  To get a jerrycan of water, I have to move a long distance, the line is always too long. If I decide to buy water, a single 20-litre jerrycan is at Shs2,000. This is too expensive for me because I also have animals to feed at home,  Ms Nansubuga said. Ms Jacqueline Nabatanzi, a resident of Naava Village, said despite not having running water in her home, staff from National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) have continued to give them monthly water bills. Their [NWSC] engineers have failed to come and check what happened to our line, but they are continuing to bring their bills,  Ms Nabatanzi said.Mr Faizo Namayuba, the vice chairperson of Njeru Central Division, put the water scarcity problem on NWSC, which he accused of failure to provide a second water storage reservoir in the area. They [NWSC] promised to give us a second storage reservoir tank at Kizungu, but it is not forthcoming. It is sad that running water has been off for long ,  he said. Mr Charles Okuonzi, the NWSC branch general manager in Jinja area, confirmed that people who are staying in hilly areas are facing water scarcity due to low pressure in the taps. He said some villages are suffering from water shortage due to pipes which got damaged as a result of the ongoing construction works on Katosi-Nyenga River Nile bridge road section.Currently, NWSC has a total of 7,182 customers and among these 6,080 are domestic users, 782 are commercial and institutes and 241 are stand pipes. A total of 74 cubic million litres are supplied in Njeru Municipality per month.

27,House cracks displace 200 families - Daily Monitor,"Namisindwa. More than 200 families in Namisindwa District have been displaced after their houses developed life-threatening cracks following earth movements.The affected residents, mostly from Buwandyambi and Buyaka in Namisindwa Town Council, have been experiencing the cracks since last year.The movements have also caused cracks on a 4km road linking the district headquarters to Magale Town Council.Some displaced families have sought refuge in the neighbourhoods while others live in the cracked houses.Mr Stephen Wepukhulu, a local leader, said government has not intervened since the first incident was reported. We are worried and homeless but our government leaders have not taken this issue seriously. They are waiting for us to die in our houses on large scale before they respond,  he said. We have never experienced such a phenomenon in this district,  he said, adding that the cracks mainly occur after a downpour.While visiting the affected areas in October last year, Mr Musa Ecweru, the State minister for Relief and Disaster Preparedness, pledged to send a team of experts to study and find out the cause.The district chairperson, Mr George William Wopuwa, urged government to come up with an immediate plan to resettle the affected families to safer areas. This disaster cannot wait for government to resettle people in phases. They should devise another alternative, which is faster,  he said.In January, government launched the first phase of the Shs32b project in Bunambutye Sub-county in Bulambuli District where 101 houses are being built for mudslide victims. Namisindwa has been allocated only 15 slots. The other beneficiaries are Bulambuli, Manafwa, Sironko and Bududa districts.Mr Micheal Mwangale, the district environment officer, said a team of geologists from Makerere University visited the area but the findings are not yet out, adding that more research needs to be done.He, however, said the cause of the earth movements could be a result of poor farming methods, which have affected the soil structures. The parent rock could have been affected by poor farming methods such as encroachment on river banks, causing the soil movement,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/House-cracks-displace-200-families/688334-5061062-1oscr7/index.html

Amoroto Bridge in Kidongole Sub-county, Bukedea, has not been worked for the past year.Mr Samuel Oluka, 60, a resident, told Daily Monitor last week that a boy is nursing a broken leg in Tororo after falling off the bridge while riding a bicycle across the wooden walkways improvised by residents. In September last year, we also lost a 19-year-old student of Kidongole Seed Secondary School, who was crossing the bridge. She fell off and was swept away by running water, her body was found the next day in the rice fields,  Mr Oluka said. We are informed it is a Unra (Uganda National Roads Authority) road, let them come to our rescue lest it disables and kills more, we have tried [seeking help from] both districts but they tell us that they cannot afford the money needed to fix the bridge,  he added.Mr Faustino Osuwan, a resident of Kaseibei Village, Butebo Sub-county in Pallisa, said he has sold 10 head of cattle and land to treat his 30-year-old son whose spinal code was dislocated after falling off the bridge on October 10, last year. My son has been referred to India for an operation, Shs45m is needed, yet I have spent more than Shs35m on treatment in Kisubi, Platinum, Kizito hospitals but to no avail, my son has been in motionless for the last seven months,  he said.Mr Osuwan said his son was a bread winner for his family of six children, but since then, he has assumed that responsibility.Mr Micheal Okwii, the secretary works in Bukedea, said he and the district chairperson have visited several offices at the Ministry of Works and Unra for intervention but in vain. That family needs more than Shs45m to go to India but have failed to raise it since they were referred in February. It is a peasant family, it is like the bridge signed a death certificate of this young man,  he said. Mr Okwii said last year the team from the ministry visited the site and estimated its repairs at Shs1.2b but they have never returned.However, Mr Julius Musinguzi, the Unra regional manager, said rehabilitation and upgrade of key bridges in the region is underway.He said Unra complaints that need to be addressed are being handled by the authority s directorate of planning.Mr Ahmed Awoii Okwir, the Unra Soroti station manager, said the site in question falls under Mbale station but Mr Moses Olemukan, the Bukedea chairperson, said when they approached Mbale, they were told that the bridge falls under Soroti.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Collapsed-Bukedea-Pallisa-bridge-kills-one-disables-2/688334-5061076-n1ant0z/index.html
29,Refugees to benefit from water project - Daily Monitor,"YUMBE. The Equatorial Coca Cola Bottling Company, South Sudan in partnership with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Wednesday launched a solar and generator-powered water scheme project in Village 9 and Village 10 in Zone 4 at Bidi Bidi settlement. The project was implemented by Water Mission Uganda. Mr Rogers Mugenyi, an engineer with Water Missions Uganda, said the water project, which is valued at more than Shs400m, is expected to serve up to 6,450 refugees. The refugees in this area used to rely on water browsers but it was unreliable and very expensive on the side of UNHCR. We expect that once we are done with connecting all the systems, the water system will be much closer to the beneficiaries,  he said.Mr Mark Hoogendam, the general manager of United Beverage Company (UBC) South Sudan, said the decision was hatched last year in their board meeting to give back to the South Sudanese refugees in Uganda.He said a similar project was carried out in West Africa where 500,000 refugees got about 1.3 billion litres of clean water.Mr Acacio Jafar Juliao, the UNHCR head of sub-office in Yumbe District, lauded the donation, adding that it is expected to improve the water ratio per individual from the current 16 litres to 20 litres per person each day.He said water shortage in the area has been as a result of environmental destruction, adding that since November last year, when dry spell started, thousands of refugees have been facing acute water shortage in Bidi Bidi Settlement. Mr Acacio said UNHCR this year alone has planned to plant 1 million trees in Yumbe District.Ms Pauline Mundoro, 30, a resident of Odravu Sub-county in Abara Parish, said:  As one of the host community members, I am extremely happy this will now reduce the burden of moving for several kilometres in search of water. Bidi Bidi settlement hosts some 224,000 South Sudanese refugees.Report2018. Uganda is one of the largest refugee-hosting nations in the world, with more than 1,100,000 refugees (as of the end of 2018). The vast influx of refugees is due to several factors in Uganda s neighbouring countries, especially war and violence in South Sudan and the DR Congo, and associated economic crisis and political instability in the region. Uganda has relatively  friendly  policies that provide rights to the refugees, such as rights to education, work, private property, healthcare and other basic social services.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Refugees-benefit-from-water-project/688334-5061084-sqdnn9/index.html

The Minister of State for Primary Education, Ms Rosemary Seninde, has urged teachers to equip students with business skills, away from the formal education in order to earn a living.Ms Seninde made the remarks while addressing teachers during the 4th skill training workshop for teachers under Walimu Saccos Union held at Kibuli Muslim Teachers College in Kampala at the weekend. Teach children right from primary and secondary levels. Skilling is already in the curriculum but it is just not being implemented yet children are supposed to be developed fully,  she said.On misusing moneyMs Seninde said teachers have been getting sacco money but they have been misusing it, with some buying boda bodas or hiring them out to people and are at times stolen, leaving them in loss. Teach the children in schools, pass on knowledge to others. Our curriculum has issues of skilling but they are not passed on to children. During our time, schools used to teach us these things but something went wrong. Government schools say government has not funded the skilling and private schools say they don t have time,  she said.Mr Steven Nabende, the board chairman of Walimu Saccos Union, said the Sacco is meant to equip teachers with entrepreneurship skills. Currently the national teachers sacco has 265 saccos in the country with 187 saccos already benefiting from government s mandated Shs2.5 billion of which government has so far enrolled Shs14.1 billion,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Students-need-skilling-says-minister/688334-5061136-15ev541/index.html

32,Passport shortage hits labour export agencies - Daily Monitor,"Kampala- Ugandans seeking passports to travel abroad may have to wait for some time as the country has run short of material to print the official travel document.The most affected are youth seeking jobs abroad through the different labour export agencies that for the last one week have not been able to receive passports for their clients. The issue of passports not being available has disorganised [us] too much because we had clients who were set to [travel]this week knowing that their passports were supposed to be out already,  a director of one of the external labour recruiting company told Daily Monitor yesterday.The Ministry of Internal Affairs spokesperson, Mr Jacob Siminyu, said:  I am still in a meeting. The only thing you can do is to send me an e-mail with questions, I will then provide the answers.  By the time of filing this story, he had not yet responded to our e-mail.The State Minister for Internal Affairs, Mr Obiga Kania, referred us to the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, saying:  I have not yet been briefed about passport shortage. This newspaper learnt from a source within the department that they will be ready to print passports by the start of next week. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak on behalf of the department, said only those passports for emergency travels such as sick people referred for urgent medical attention abroad can be printed at the moment.The external labour recruitment agencies that we spoke to said they have hundreds of clients stranded because of the passports. Some of our clients have contracts signed and flights booked. It is going to be expensive to cancel and re-book the flights,  said a director of a company that exports domestic workers to the Middle East.When this reporter visited the ministry premises yesterday, business was going on normally but the officials were mostly serving those applying for new passports, renewals and those with queries.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Passport-shortage-Siminyu-labour-export-agencies-Kania/688334-5059004-15pvihez/index.html
33,Gun fire outside army headquaters as Sudan protestors press on - Daily Monitor,"Sudanese security forces fired tear gas early Tuesday at thousands of anti-government protesters who had been demonstrating outside army headquarters for a third straight night, but soldiers intervened firing in the air, witnesses said.Thousands of protesters have massed at the Khartoum complex since Saturday, urging the military to back them in demanding the resignation of President Omar al-Bashir and the formation of a transitional government.It is the largest rally since protests erupted over a hike in bread prices in December, before transforming into nationwide demonstrations against Bashir's 30-year rule.Early on Tuesday, members of the National Intelligence and Security Service and riot police fired tear gas at the protesters in an abortive bid to disperse the sit-in, protest movement organisers said.""There was heavy firing of tear gas after which army soldiers opened the gates of the compound for protesters to enter,"" a witness told AFP.""A few minutes later a group of soldiers fired gunshots in the air to push back the security forces who were firing tear gas.""A second witness too said soldiers had intervened against the security force agents.An AFP correspondent, some five kilometres (three miles) away from the headquarters, heard shooting for about four minutes. Since the protests erupted in December, the armed forces have remained on the sidelines even as security agents and riot police have cracked down.Demonstrators have called on the army to protect them from the deadly crackdown, after days of camping outside its headquarters, which also houses Bashir's residence and the defence ministry.Wish of the revolutionDefence Minister General Awad Ibnouf vowed that the army would prevent any slide into chaos.""Sudan's armed forces understand the reasons for the demonstrations and is not against the demands and aspirations of the citizens, but it will not allow the country to fall into chaos,"" Ibnouf said on Monday, according to the official SUNA news agency.In a separate statement, army chief of staff Kamal Abdelmarouf said the military was ""discharging its responsibility in securing and protecting citizens.""Officials say 38 people have died in protest-related violence since December.Interior Minister Bushara Juma said seven protesters died and 15 were wounded on Saturday when forces tried to disperse them.He said 42 security personnel were injured and 2,496 arrests made.The umbrella group spearheading the protests appealed to the army on Monday for talks on forming a transitional government.""We call on the Sudanese armed forces to talk directly with the Alliance for Freedom and Change for facilitating the peaceful process of forming a transitional government,"" said Omar el-Digeir, a senior member of the group.Digeir said the protest organisers had formed a council to open talks aimed at agreeing a ""transitional government that represents the wish of the revolution"".Reading from a statement, he also called on the armed forces ""to withdraw their support for a regime that has lost its legitimacy"" and to support the ""people's alternative for a transition to a civilian democratic government"".Economic mismanagement The rally outside the army headquarters has been the largest since protests began on December 19 in the central town of Atbara, quickly spreading to the capital and nationwide.The European Union said an ""unprecedented"" number of people had come out calling for change since Saturday.""The people of Sudan have shown remarkable resilience in the face of extraordinary obstacles over many years,"" the EU's External Action Service said.""Their trust must be won through concrete action by the government.""The protesters accuse Bashir's administration of economic mismanagement that has led to soaring food prices and chronic shortages of fuel and foreign currency.After a meeting chaired by Bashir on Sunday, Sudan's security council said the demands of the protesters ""have to be heard"".Bashir, wanted by the Hague-based International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide connected with the suppression of a now 16-year-old ethnic minority rebellion in the western region of Darfur, took power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.He has remained defiant, introducing tough measures that have seen protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists arrested.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Gun-fire-army-headquaters-Sudan-Omar-alBashir-protestors/688340-5063414-uk3vehz/index.html

37,"Rwanda mourns the dead, 25 years since genocide began - Daily Monitor","Rwanda on Sunday begins one hundred days of mourning for over 800,000 people slaughtered in a genocide that shocked the world, a quarter of a century on from the day it began.President Paul Kagame will start a week of commemoration activities by lighting a remembrance flame at the Kigali Genocide Memorial, where more than 250,000 victims are believed to be buried, mainly from the Tutsi people.They are only some of those killed by the genocidal Hutu forces, members of the old army and militia forces called the ""Interahamwe"", that began their bloody campaign of death on April 7, 1994, the day after the assassination of President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu.Some were shot; most were beaten or hacked by machetes.The killings lasted until Kagame, then 36, led the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) into Kigali on July 4, ending the slaughter and taking control of the devastated country.Kagame, now 61 and who has been in power ever since, will lead the memorial to the dead.After lighting the flame, Kagame is expected to make a key speech at the Kigali Convention Centre, a dome-shaped auditorium in the centre of the capital, a modern building emblematic of the regeneration of Rwanda since the dark days of 1994.Kagame will then preside over a vigil at the country's main football ground. The Amahoro National Stadium -- whose name means ""peace"" in Rwanda's Kinyarwanda language -- was used by the UN during the genocide to protect thousands of people of the Tutsi minority from being massacred on the streets outside.Deep trauma In past years, ceremonies have triggered painful flashbacks for some in the audience, with crying, shaking, screaming and fainting amid otherwise quiet vigils.For many survivors, forgiveness remains difficult when the bodies of their loved ones have not been found and many killers are still free.A quarter of a century on, the east African nation has recovered economically, but the trauma still casts a dark shadow.Kagame has kept an authoritarian hold as he steers the small, landlocked East African nation through economic recovery. Growth in 2018 was a heady 7.2 percent, according to the African Development Bank (AfDB).Some 10 leaders are expected to pay their respects, mostly from nations across the continent.Former colonial ruler Belgium is sending Prime Minister Charles Michel.But French President Emmanuel Macron is not attending, with France represented by Herve Berville, a 29-year old Rwandan-born member of parliament in Paris.Rwanda has accused France of being complicit in the genocide through its support for the Hutu-led government and of helping perpetrators escape.Paris has consistently denied complicity in the bloodshed, though former president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2010 acknowledged France had made ""serious errors of judgement"".On Friday, Macron appointed an expert panel to investigate France's actions at the time.Macron is not the only notable absence; former ally Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is also not attending, amid accusations by Kigali that Uganda is supporting Rwandan rebels.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Rwanda-genocide-Kagame-Tutsi-RPF-UN/688340-5060506-u3yfoy/index.html
38,UK police probing five over Rwanda genocide - Daily Monitor,"British police said Tuesday it was reviewing allegations against five men accused by Rwanda of involvement in the country's 1994 genocide.Two days after the world commemorated the quarter-century anniversary of the gruesome ethnic massacre, the Metropolitan Police's War Crimes Unit said it had ""received a request from Rwandan authorities in January 2018 to investigate five individuals.""Documentation relevant to this request has been passed to the War Crimes Unit and the unit is currently assessing this material,"" it said.Some 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were beaten, shot, or hacked to death with machetes in 100 days of slaughter.Citing human rights concerns, a British court in 2015 denied a Rwandan extradition request for the five men: Vincent Brown, Charles Munyaneza, Emmanuel Nteziryayo, Celestin Ugirashebuja and Celeste Mutabaruka.They are accused by Rwanda of genocide, complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity, conspiracy to murder, forming a criminal gang and inciting disorder, but have reportedly denied any involvement.Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced the creation of a commission of historians and researchers that will delve into the state archives for clarity on France's actions during the genocide.Rwanda accuses France of having supported the ethnic Hutu forces behind most of the killing and of helping some of the perpetrators to escape, allegations Paris rejects.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/UK-police-five-Rwanda-genocide-War-Crimes-Unit-Munyaneza/688340-5063676-13muwkr/index.html
39,Dedicated to pupils with special needs - Daily Monitor,"Maria Nansubuga Galiwango was supposed to be a journalist. That is what she longed for as a child. She thought that each of her days would be filled with an adventure of travelling to new places.Instead, after completing Senior Four, her elder brother encouraged her to become a teacher because of her love for children. That was the turning point as Nansubuga joined Gaba Teachers College where she graduated with a certificate in primary school teaching. It was the beginning of the journey into the unknown. She got a job at a school that she never thought would change her life forever.Tough startIn 2012, Nansubuga joined Hill Preparatory School, Naguru, kickstarting her journey in teaching.  I was given an inclusion class but that was a big challenge,  the 32-year-old said.An inclusive class has learners with disabilities and special education learning alongside their non-disabled peers. I had no interest at first. I was even afraid but after prayer I realised that this was a special group of people God had allowed me to reach,  Nansubuga recalls.As we sat for the interview, the love from the children was evident. A couple of them played with her while some hugged her, interrupting the session at several stages.Getting into the grooveA multi-talented teacher, Nansubuga later completed her diploma at Uganda Martyrs University-Nkozi in 2015 courtesy of the school director Clare Wavamunno and head teacher Ambrose Kibuuka. She attended several school trainings at Lugogo in Kampala which were regularly organised by Special Olympics Uganda as well as Umoja Global Community Music Therapy. The British Council also offered her an opportunity to travel to the United Kingdom in 2014 during an exchange programme to improve her skills of teaching special needs children.  I picked interest in furthering my knowledge of special needs education because I found these children amazing. They are so loving and I started seeing Jesus in them,  she said.Another dimensionNansubuga who teaches English and Mathematics, currently conducts private lessons at the convenience of the parents  homes for the last one year.Although she left Hill last year, she still goes there to conduct swimming lessons on a private arrangement.Nansubuga said she is now married to teaching even though she opted to start her private classes which she says offered her greener pastures. There are some parents who are still not comfortable bringing their special needs children in public and I find that an opportunity to reach out to them and help them develop,  she said.Nansubuga said she chose that approach because it is exciting yet she has a passion for seeing children with special needs excel. For special needs children, there s something new everyday, she says. They are fun and can be a challenge sometimes especially children with intellectual disabilities but we get to know each other. Nansubuga believes a good special needs educator is someone who has a passion for what they teach, and who you teach.  Being flexible and passionate is something I take pride in as an educator. I constantly talk to them to be able to build self-esteem. She was forced into swimming to tame autistic children who are normally hyper, especially after lunch making it necessary to curb extra energy.The common intellectual disability cases she has handled include; autism, down syndrome, cerebral palsy, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. Each of those cases are handled differently and that is the best lesson I have learned in life. Everyone is different from the other,  she notes, adding that loving such children is what makes us human.Moving onNansubuga agrees that she cannot get all the money she needs from teaching as such she handles different projects. After opting to leave Hill Preparatory School last year, she joined Kampala International Pre-School in Naguru before she settled at Bourneville International School. She supplements this by working in a network marketing company, Success, which deals in cryptocurrencies. I do personal work with Success online and I never have to worry about my teaching appointments,  she says about her balancing act.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Dedicated-pupils-with-special-needs/688336-5060824-glwrmwz/index.html
40,NTCs should offer computer courses - Daily Monitor,"Despite computer being one of the subjects taught in schools today, several National Teacher s College (NTCs) across the country do not conduct these courses for their students. As such several stakeholders in the education sector have called on the Education ministry to consider having in place computer courses to produce teachers who can impart computer education to the learners. Last year, National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC), recommended that computer studies must be taught at both O and A-Level.In fact Denis Tabo, a former student of Gulu Central High School told Daily Monitor that limited access to computer labs, and lack of computer books was the reason why students performed dismally in computer exams in the 2018-2019 national exams. We used to access computer lab twice a week for only 80 minutes a day which is not enough for a student to practice,   he said. He also cited lack of computer books that has made most of the students fail the theory part of the computer exams due to limited books in various schools. But Michael Okidi, the head teacher Layibi High School, advised schools to take up computer lessons when they already have in place enough computers and well-trained computer teachers. Lack of professional teachers is forcing us to hire anybody with a Bachelors in Computer Science some of whom are not equipped with the right knowledge of teaching students,  he said. Charles Nyakito, the principal Unyama NTC, said computer studies are not yet in their curriculum.  We have been advocating for Kyambogo University to substitute Typewriting course with computer studies but we are not yet successful,  Nyakito said. Currently, only Business Education students at Unyama NTC are taught computer, which is a small group,  he adds.Decrying the status quo, Ronald Lukyamuzi, the vice chairman Information and Communication Technology Teachers Association of Uganda, said most of the members of the association are not professional teachers but university ICT and Computer Science graduates.  Government should also equip all the schools teaching computer studies with computers. Most schools have only about five computers which are shared by 60 students and no projector to support teachers in class,  he said. Computer studies were included in secondary school syllabus to encourage practical work and skills to allow students to accommodate the changing technologies in ICT.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/NTCs-should-offer-computer-courses/688336-5060874-jfktjhz/index.html
41,"I do not regret becoming a teacher, despite poor pay - Daily Monitor","Teachers complain about little pay and in fact this has discouraged a number of people from joining the profession. Not for Joviah Nyakwera. The teacher is proud of her choice of profession. Nyakwera describes her 12-year experience in teaching as an amazing journey, which she would love to end only on retirement. A number of teachers are in the profession but do not like their work. I am grateful for what I am. Through teaching I have been exposed to people from different walks of life and I have been able to influence their lives positively,  she says. Born to Yofesi Ndoleriire of Rubona Bunyangabu, Nyakwera says she was inspired to join the profession by her parents who were both teachers.She recalls being taught while at home something she attributes her love for teaching to.  I always spare time to revise with my children. This helps me discover their strengths but also weaknesses in learning,  she says.Nyakwera joined school in 1989 at Rubona Primary School and after completing Primary Seven, she joined Kahinju Secondary School in Fort Portal for O-Level.While at Kahinju, she was drawn further to teaching after seeing the commitment and selfless attitude that her teachers displayed. My teachers were a great inspiration. Some would even sacrifice their leisure time just to give us extra lessons on hard concepts which we would not have grasped during lessons,  she says adding that this selfless attitude is what has made some teachers influential people.In 2000, Nyakwera joined Progressive Secondary School, Wandegeya for A-Level with History, Economics, Geography and Divinity as her subject combination.She later enrolled for a Bachelors of Arts in Education at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. This was a dream come true considering she was enrolling for a course that she had longed to pursue.In 2004, after her graduation, Nyakwera started her teaching journey at Kaboyo Secondary School in Kabarole District. She was not employed on fulltime basis but it did not stop her from doing her job well.  I used to wake up early in the morning and be at school on time regardless of the little pay I was getting,  she recalls. In all this, her joy was seeing her students excel and move on to the next level. Diversifying She was at Kaboyo until 2010 when she was transferred to Kibiito Senior Secondary School to teach History and Divinity in Senior Four and Senior Six.She wanted to diversify. And so she applied to become an examiner for Senior Four History at Uneb in 2009. This is a decision Nyakwera does not regret. She says becoming an examiner has helped her learn many ideas thus helping her get more students to pass her subject.  I have learnt how they mark at Uneb and what they consider during marking,  she notes. In 2012, Nyakwera was transferred to Nyarukoma Secondary School in Kyenjonjo District as a teacher on government payroll. She was there for two years until the administration of Kibiito Secondary School asked for her services again. In 2014, she returned to Kibiito Secondary School but alongside teaching, she became the senior woman. This, she says, made her realise that students have several issues that teachers need to address so that they are nurtured and attain a holistic education. Students have so many issues that affect their daily lives. They range from physical, social to physiological. If not addressed, it becomes hard for the students to perform well. Important to note is that as teachers, we have a big role to play in these student s lives since we spend a lot of time with them, compared to their parents,  she explains.Growing careerNyakwera is now the deputy head teacher in charge of general duties at the school. Despite teaching the candidate classes, she spares time to interact with the students and through this, she finds out the major challenges that are affecting students and finds possible ways to solve them. To get expertise on this, Nyakwera has enrolled for a Masters in Counselling Psychology at Uganda Martyrs University, Nkozi. To her, a good teacher is supposed to provide counselling and guidance to the students.Asked about some of the challenges affecting the teaching profession, Nyakwera says the greatest is teachers who join the profession as the last option, as well as businessmen who open schools and have led to unhealthy competition among schools. These business people are not interested in the kind of students their school churns out. They are only interested in instant results so as to attract more numbers in their schools. This has led to high level of malpractices in schools,  she observes.Nyakwera says for a teacher to excel in teaching, they need to be selfless, patient, hardworking and committed. And athough the salary may not be that much, she say there is nothing as gratifying as a teacher seeing their students excelling in future.Voices Nyakwera is a teacher that is very determined to get results. She is good at engaging parents so as to make sure that her students get help both at home and at school. Gwendolyn Kanyomozi, teacher She is self-driven and patient with her students. She is also a good counsellor who always engages students to make sure they are on the right track. Moses Rubalema, lecturer, Mountains of the Moon University She is strict and does not tolerate laziness. But it is her being strict that has modelled me into what I am today. She does not want to see any of her students fail.

42,Ensure you enrol for a course you won t regret - Daily Monitor,"In 2016, Makerere University students protested the institution s decision to scrap 32 courses. The affected students complained that the decision would affect their chances at gainful employment in the competitive job market. Commenting on the institution s decision, Prof John Ddumba Ssentamu, the vice chancellor of Makerere University then, said some of the courses were merged, dropped totally or restructured to give holistic training to students. He added that students must understand that curriculums are always reviewed. And while Makerere was restructuring courses, in Mukono at Uganda Christian University, some new courses were being introduced. According to Ivan Naijuka, the university spokesperson at the time, the decision to review their curriculum to include new courses was because the institution aims at giving their graduates a competitive advantage in the job market.  The need to train professionals who are whole in the sense of knowledge, integrity as well as stewardship directed the institution s decision to include new courses,  he said. But with the various changes in courses of study at our institutions, what should inform one s choice  PassionSolomon Eriatu, a former student at Kampala International University, says he had always been passionate about journalism and when it was time for him to join university, he could not look any further than a course which would offer him the much desired training. And so Eriatu enrolled for Mass Communication.  I am an extrovert and sociable person and basing on those character traits and my passion for news reporting, I decided to join journalism class. My role models are all media people and I had been practising how to write stories since primary school.  Similarly, Judith Akwelele enrolled for a Bachelors in Child Development because of her love for children.  I could not have opted for any other course as my passion for children in unrivalled. And contrary to popular belief, I had high grades that are synonymous with those who enrol for courses such as Law. At least I felt happier than my colleagues doing Law because they were influenced by their parents,  she says. InspirationOften times, students envision a conducive and favourable working environment ready to embrace them after university through the eyes of their role models. Sean Rukundo, a graduate of Procurement and Logistics, currently a CIPS student at Uganda Management Institute, says he was inspired to study procurement and logistics because of his father s success.  Having seen my father move through the ranks in a government ministry s department of procurement, I was inspired to pursue the same course. I envisioned a job market in favour of procurement officers. Unfortunately, times are dynamic and I have not been able to find a stable,  narrates Rukundo. Money factorDespite her passion for Law, 43-year-old Mary Ouma, enrolled for Bachelor of Arts in Education because she was getting government sponsorship on the latter at Makerere University.  The high tuition fees for law school left me with no option but to venture into teaching. Fortunately, I have grown to love the profession. And luckily the job market is very favourable for my kind even with the changing times,  she says. GradesAlthough some are driven by passion, others are forced to choose certain courses by their scores in national examinations. For instance Martin Kaganzi s dream of joining journalism class still remains a dream.  I was given Public Administration at Kyambogo University as my 14 points at UACE could not allow for Journalism,  he shares. Some students opt for certain courses after getting intimidated out of the ones they have been admitted to. Most universities give students a window of two weeks to if they are to switch. Akwelele reveals that some of her peers joined Child Development course because they thought it would be easier for them to pass and be free from retaking papers. Similarly Sheila Alupot, a third year student of Nkumba University switched from Mass Communication to Bachelors of Social Work and Social Administration after feeling overwhelmed.  The multiple theories and numerous fieldwork assignments in the Journalism class scared me,  she says. According to Doreen Metta, a lecturer at St Lawrence University, students need to get career guidance.  Students who receive career guidance are well equipped with the knowledge of which courses to study.  Metta encourages both teachers and parents to be involved in providing the rightful career guidance to their children so that by the time they get to university, they are sure of what they want to pursue.  Parents should be involved in exposing their children to different materials and practices that will help them make their choices. Understand your child s interest in say; medicine, and allowing them to interface with medical persons as well as be exposed to hospital environments,  she advises.WHAT THE STUDENTS SAY I enrolled for a Journalism course because I had always admired being a presenter either on television or radio but because I encountered a lot of challenges getting into that field, I got demotivated and now I just write.  Kezia Koburungi, Mass Communication student KIU We live in a world of technology and innovations.

43,"Networking, easy way of growing career - Daily Monitor","For your career to take off, you will need the help of people who will avail opportunities, know-how and connections. Just like a popular quote by American businessman and media magnate Sumner Redstone states:  If you never venture beyond what you know... You have spawned your own limitations.  To grow your professional relationships, start with the people you already know; your family and friends who will eventually introduce you to their family and friends, which will continuously expand your networking circle to a level that is satisfactory to you. Although networking might be difficult for naturally introverted people, they must make an effort to go out and meet new people because that is one way in which careers and businesses are built. TV personality, fashion designer and host of the popular Kwivuga Poetry Sessions, Nunu Umuringa Butare s career is an embodiment of the power of networking. As a social entrepreneur, her business depends on the good will of as many people as possible.  I was lucky to realise that one cannot grow or succeed in a vacuum so I set out to meet as many people as possible and make meaningful connections. I attend every event I am invited to, offer help whenever I am called upon, and treat every connection with as much respect as possible,  she says. Breaking barriersNetworks have the power to break barriers and establish the most unlikely relationships. Edwin Musiime, the NTV Property Show presenter, says he has entered the House of Lords, accessed the United States White House relying on the power of networks.  I always say that our networks determine our net worth. The power of networking has enabled me attain high levels of leverage across all spheres of influence. The Bible says iron sharpens iron; people make you a better, wiser and stronger person  Musiime reveals. Networks also help influence decision, avail mentors, life coaches and role models that are very essential for both business and career growth. As Musiime says, we are always five people away from the person we want to meet the most in the universe; someone you know might know someone who knows someone else, who knows that person you believe has the power to change your life forever.  One of my role models and personal mentor is Vusi Thembekwayo who is regarded as the world s youngest and most impressive public speaker and I met him through my vast connections. I can testify that meeting him changed my life in all ways; financially, emotionally and spiritually,  adds Musiime.Nourish relationshipsLike all relationships in life, networks need to be cultivated and nurtured or they die off. Public relations specialist Muhereza Kyamutetera avers that networks need reciprocity and integrity to flourish.  In life, we all look for relationships that benefit us either financially, emotionally or intellectually. We, therefore, seek to make connections with people that are likely to fulfill those desires. Likewise, people are drawn to us because of what they think we can do for them. So meeting these expectations is important,  Kyamutetera opines. He further recommends treating every individual relationship with the utmost importance and respect. Join an associationMost professions have an association or union that brings people together. Wilson Kutegeka, the chief executive officer of ClinicMaster, is a member of the Information and Communications Technology Association of Uganda (ICTAU).  I have benefited through connections with international organisations such as the Netherlands Trust Fund which helped develop ClinicMaster to suit international standards thus getting us clients from all over the East Africa region. This would have been a very expensive and strenuous task had I undertaken it on my own,  Kutegeka shares.

44,Suicide: What is plaguing university students  - Daily Monitor,"On March 21, 2019 Ugandans woke up to news that Arthur Basalirwa, a student of Makerere University Business School (MUBS), had committed suicide. A few hours before his death, Basalirwa had posted on one of his social media accounts saying,  I am sorry but it s too late, I m sorry too much weighing on me, I do not want to live to see another day. Basalirwa had posted several other statements on social media earlier in the month which friends were later to realise were revelations that he was going through tough times but did not think deeply about them until they learnt about his death.In September 2018, Joshua Ajuna was found dead in his room in Nsibirwa Hall at Makerere University. Next to his body was a bottle of suspected poison and two suicides notes. According to the notes, personal reasons had driven Ajuna to kill himself. Earlier in April 2011, Francis Kigenyi, 23, had jumped to his death from the fifth floor of Baskon hostel on Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road in Kampala. Before his death, Kigenyi had told guests at his birthday party that his life was worthless and referred to himself as a ghost.Yet Joshua Nuwasasira, 22, a second-year student of Makerere University Business School, Mbarara study centre had in 2012, also committed suicide after he apparently spent every penny of his tuition fees on drinking and partying. He was found hanging in his rented room in Nkokonjeru, Mbarara.These are some of the suicide cases that have been reported at universities over the years, making the situation worrying. What could drive a student who is largely dependent on their parents to take their own life  DepressionAccording to Margaret Kyosaba Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, the main reason for suicides among university students is depression. She says this depression in most cases arises from maladjusted relationships, financial challenges, stress, academic anxiety, low self-esteem, drug abuse, poor performance, career indecision, uncertainty about post-school life and other informational needs. I have had chance to interact with some students who are contemplating suicide; most of them feel as though there is no way out of their situation. They are bombarded with feelings of hopelessness, fear, isolation, hatred toward themselves and so much more. The pain they feel is often immeasurable, to a point where they see no other option but to end their lives,  she explains.How can you tell Jean Nuwagaba, the head of counselling department Kyambogo University, says when a student is depressed, they may show signs of being overly sensitive to how they are perceived by others, their failures, and their relationships. They will also show signs of hopelessness, helplessness, unexplained fear of people, places, events, or objects (phobias), escapism, and general unusual or unacceptable behaviour such as drug abuse and unwarranted sexual escapades. She says sometimes some of these people overuse defense mechanisms such as denial, blame, and projection which are also indicative of mental health issues.Nevertheless, Nuwagaba says a student in such a state can get assistance through psychological interventions such as counselling, guidance, and other forms of psychosocial support.  Extreme cases should be taken to clinical psychologists or psychiatrists for further treatment,  she says.Sometimes students get depressed but fail to get anybody to talk to yet counsellors say talking can go a long way in helping one overcome painful circumstances.University intervention Ritah Namisango, the spokesperson Makerere University, says Makerere University (Mak) has a functional Counselling and Guidance Centre. The Mak Counselling and Guidance Centre is headed by a manager who is supported by professional counsellors. The managers and counsellors are fulltime members of staff at the university. The centre provides professional counselling services to both students and staff and the services are available to help students deal with and solve challenges of living that would otherwise affect their academic achievement and their wholesome being in general. She explains that the centre handles issues such as academics; for instance failure to understand or conceptualise what is taught and failure to make the required grades. It also handles psychological problems such as sexual dysfunctions, family problems, low self-esteem, poor self-concept, bereavement, and love relationships such as being dumped by a lover, failure to relate with a lover or other people, failure to quit an oppressive relationship, as well as psychiatric problems such as depression, anxiety, drug addiction, sexual harassment, HIV/Aids counselling.Apart from providing students with career guidance, the guidance and counselling unit provides first year students with a fresher s orientation where they explain to new entrants the dos and don ts of university life. During this fresher s orientation week, we give every new student at Makerere University an instruction booklet, which is meant to guide them on their life at university,  she says. This, she explains, is to minimise cases of transitional challenges.But Namisango is quick to note that the attendance of these guidance and counselling services is voluntary.At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services.Luckily, she adds that the unit has handled quite a number of depression cases among students so far.  Ever since the inception of this facility, we have tried to popularise our services among students, by distributing flyers to students, notices on noticeboards around the university and making outreaches in student hostels,  she explains.Why are students adamant Unfortunately, some students are not embracing counselling and guidance services yet. According to Biribonwa, a counsellor at Kyambogo University, though universities have created counselling departments, some students are still skeptical to go in for these services. She says some are afraid of being seen by their peers obtaining such services. It is unfortunate that though counselling is very vital for university students, some find it uncalled for and shaming,  she says, adding that for this reason at Kyambogo, they have started online counselling services to help students who would prefer online to physical meetings. Namisango also admits that though the counselling services are free, some students opt out since they are not compulsory. Way forward Biribonwa says it is high time university students accepted that everyone gets depressed at some point in their lives. However, how long it lasts is one of the key factors to determine the severity.  If depression has lasted for more than two weeks and it is affecting your day-to-day life, it is time to get treatment,  she advises.Biribonwa insists that there is absolutely no shame in getting help adding that it is important for any student who is depressed to talk to friends and open up honestly about their feelings.  If you are feeling down, tell them that. If you need someone to talk to, tell them that, too. You might be surprised by how willing they are to help you get through it,  she advises.InterventionsStudent mentors. At Kyambogo University, Dr Mildred Tibananuka, the dean of students, says in 2018, the university revamped the counselling unit to offer guidance and mentorship to students. She explains that this unit has student mentors who are trained to mentor their peers or to look out for those who are facing challenges and encourage them to come for counselling services. She adds that the unit has handled quite a number of cases among students so far.Counselling unit.

45,Why you need to check that school before sending your child there - Daily Monitor,"There are a number of advertisement activities that schools engage in to attract students which sometimes do not replicate what is on the ground. And a lot of times, some aspects which may impact on your child negatively might be happening at their school behind your back. Agnes Mweteise, was two years ago convinced to take her daughter to a school in Mbarara. She was largely excited about the school s performance in that year s O-Level results that were advertised extensively in the media.But a year after, the school s performance was different and a parent had raised the issue on how the administration always advertises wrong results to dupe them about the performance.  We were surprised when one of us armed with results from the newspaper cuttings found that they were not similar to those of Uganda National Examinations Board. The one advertised in the newspaper showed they had 10 students in Division One while those of UNEB showed that the school had got none,  said Mweteise who withdrew her daughter immediately. Milton Batekateka, a retired primary school teacher, blames the liberalisation policy in education and inadequate inspection, saying education officers should be keen on whatever material schools advertise in media. Mbarara district education officer, Gabriel Ahimbisibwe, warned that schools which dupe parents risk being de-registered and administrators arrested.  Any school found to be engaging in this practice will be de-registered. It is a very bad and dangerous strategy of attracting students,  says Ahimbisibwe. Low school charges Some schools charge rather very low school fees but are these commensurate to the services or what a student or pupil needs for his career development and social welfare Laban Kanywa, the chairperson Federation of Non State Institutions in Western Uganda, says parents should interest themselves in schools that charge very low school fees especially on how they go about the costs of running these schools. Those charging very low fees are only interested in the numbers but not in the standard of education. It is these schools where teachers are not paid or are unprofessional or starve students,  says Kanywa. Every TV, radio station and newspapers at the beginning of the school s term are awash with advertisements of schools. Adverts such as  we have professional staff, science laboratory, well-stocked library, swimming pool, and balanced diet , among others are common but as a parent do you take a step further to investigate whether these actually exist Andrew Kankiriho noted that the commercialisation of education has driven schools to employ all tricks to attract students. One of the schools here in Mbarara even duped the President. It claims to teach science and technology but when the President was going to visit the school, they hired old computers, welding and fabrication machines, sewing machines and forged a workshop, imagine,  said Kankiriho. He challenges parents to always do ground check on schools before enrolling children but added that even after they enrol, parents should always check on the capacity of the school to meet their expectations. Emotional violenceUnlike other forms of violence, emotional violence does not leave physical scars but wounds the heart which lowers one s esteem, dignity, and self-worth. It includes constant belittling, shaming, humiliating, negative comparisons, and frequent yelling and bullying. Nathan Mugume, the head teacher Mbarara Junior School, admits this kind of violence exists in schools and it has very disastrous effects even to a nation; such as having a violent nation. If a teacher is violent, abusive to pupils they may grow up to have violent and abusive families. As teachers we should guide, counsel, discuss and show empathy to pupils because we can either kill or build their future,  says Mugume.He says parents need to always interest themselves in checking their children s behaviour but also monitor the behaviour of school managers and staff towards the pupils.Third partiesDue to commercialisation of education, competition has forced schools to hire private brokers and agents who comb areas looking for students while spreading the  excellence  gospel of the schools.Unsuspecting parents easily get convinced by these brokers, forgetting that these are only interested in getting paid and whatever happens after is none of their business.  During our days, competition was driven by performance but now it is about the numbers you can attract just for economic gain. Why do you employ brokers if your school is sending pupils to first class institutions with good courses   Esau Muhangi, a retired secondary school teacher, asks.This is where the trouble lies. Pupils are in schools not just to learn but also make business for the proprietor.In case you check... Security. The general security at the school and in the neighbourhood should be safe. Care. Some teachers do not have proper handling of students even when they are disciplining them. Ability to teach. This is not just about having professional teachers but those who are able to teach.Hygiene. Are the toilets, latrine, kitchen, dining area and classrooms in good condition  Behaviour. The behaviour of students in a given school can give you a picture of whether it is a good school or not. Plans. Ask about the future plans of the school, especially if the school is new or just building up momentum.Performance. Consider student performance, not just in P7, S4 or S6, but the other classes too.Games. Ensure that the school pays attention and develops learners through co-curricular activities.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Check-that-school-before-sending-your-child-there/688336-5060788-hpnsow/index.html

Sub-Saharan Africa saw a 10 percent increase at $46 billion, according to the bank.The United States economy grew strongly while outbound flows from Gulf countries and Russia also rose, according to the bank, which said this explained much of the gains.Excluding China, the remittances amounted to $462 billion, significantly more than foreign direct investment over the period, which stood at $344 billion.Among the development goals set by the United Nations in 2015 was reducing the cost of remittances to three percent.However, banks on average were charging 11 percent in the first quarter of 2019 while post offices charged seven percent.""The high costs of money transfers reduce the benefits of migration,"" Dilip Ratha, the report's lead author, said in a statement.""Renegotiating exclusive partnerships and letting new players operate through national post offices, banks and telecommunications companies will increase competition and lower remittance prices.""Another factor making money transfer costs rise are banks' efforts to avoid money-laundering and terrorism finance.Some banks simply cease working with some money transfer organizations deemed too risky, according to the report.""Banks indicate that risks to their reputation... deter them from having correspondent bank accounts,"" it said.
