0,Ugandan sues Rwanda over closed borders - Daily Monitor,"A Ugandan citizen has dragged the government of Rwanda to the East African Court of Justice over what he terms as an illegal closure of border posts early this year. On February 28, Rwanda closed its borders with Uganda in Katuna and Chanika in Kabale and Kisoro districts respectively.Mr Steven Kalali, an advocate says he is aggrieved by the conduct of Rwandan President Paul Kagame.He accuses him of ordering immigration and revenue officials at the border posts not to allow Ugandan citizens and traders to cross into the country over unjustified reasons.In a petition he filed against the Attorney General of Rwanda, Mr Kalali contends that what Rwanda has done defeats the spirit of the East African Treaty, Free trade and Common Market Protocol since the closed border posts were also serving other countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi.Mr Kalali filed his petition at the registry of the East African Court of Justice at the Supreme Court in Kololo, Kampala.In his petition, Mr Kalali wants the justices at regional court, to order Rwanda open its borders that have been closed since February 28, opened, to allow a free movement of Ugandan citizens and goods in the spirit of free trade.The closure affected hundreds of cargo trucks destined for Rwanda. The Rwandan authorities advised the truck drivers to turn back and use Mirama Hill border in Ntungamo District, which is 100 kilometers away.Initially, Rwanda claimed it had closed the borders to work on the Onestop border post.READ: President Kagame calls for talks over standoff",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Ugandan-Rwandas-attorney-general-border-Katuna/688334-5059212-sg0o48/index.html
1,People skills at heart of DR Congo's long fight against Ebola - Daily Monitor,"Evelyne was one of the first victims of the Ebola epidemic which broke out in eastern DR Congo last August, the second deadliest in its known history.Against the odds, the nurse not only survived the haemorrhagic virus, whose outbreak has claimed nearly 700 lives, but has also returned to the fray.After receiving a vaccination, Evelyne is now tending Ebola-affected children -- part of a campaign that places social skills at the heart of the effort to roll back the dreaded disease.At an Ebola treatment centre, Evelyne (her name has been changed for the purposes of this story) cradles a seven-month-old baby girl called Sarah.She provides the infant with desperately-needed human contact -- visitors are kept behind protective screens to prevent them from coming into contact with the body fluids of patients who may have the virus.""The first test was negative,"" Evelyne calls out. ""We are waiting for the results of the second.""Collateral victims The UN children's agency UNICEF says 30 percent of the 683 deaths registered so far are children or aged under 18 years.Many children are collateral victims, such as Luc, a five-year-old boy playing football with Consolee Katsiwa, a psychologist in a creche run by UNICEF.His mother died of Ebola a day earlier, Katsiwa said.""We are keeping him under observation since he was in direct contact with his mother,"" she said, adding that he would be monitored for 21 days -- the time taken for the virus to incubate.""If he shows signs of the disease... he could contaminate others in his community.""At a school in Butembo, five pupils carefully take notes during an Ebola awareness programme.One of the speakers is Huguette, a 24-year-old woman who was cured after being infected following an Ebola death in January.""I would like to raise awareness among my brothers in Butembo, to tell them that the disease exists, that it is a reality and that it's not stuff that has been invented.""If you don't head for the Ebola treatment centre you will die. But if you go there at the very early stages, you will survive like me,"" she said.Appease the spiritsDenial has been costly and bloody. Two Ebola treatment centres in Butembo and the neighbouring town of Katwa were attacked in February and March. A policeman died in the violence.The centre at Katwa reopened last Saturday and authorities are now trying to get locals more involved in the Ebola response drive that many see as being led by foreign aid workers.The health ministry meanwhile said sociologists and anthropologists had called for traditional chiefs to ""observe rituals to appease the spirits"" before the Katwa centre reopened.""Confidence-building has taken place between the communities and those involved in the response programme in areas where the most violence was recorded,"" it added.Residents have asked the government and non-governmental organisations to improve the ramshackle infrastructure to provide potable water and better roads.""Ebola instils fear but people understand that it poses a danger and one must protect oneself,"" said Salome, a woman living near the Katwa centre.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the fight against the epidemic could take another six months.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/People-skills-DR-Congo-Ebola-UNICEF-WHO/688340-5059254-kkva61z/index.html
2,Opposition camp: Rest Vs Besigye - Daily Monitor,"Kampala- The run up to the 2021 General Election has arrived early, and the first barbs have been thrown; battle lines drawn. The Opposition group that has drawn first blood went for the less likely, albeit usual target, Dr Kizza Besigye. At Hotel Africana in Kampala on Thursday, the occasion was for what has been dubbed the  DP Bloc  to sign a pact that binds them. DP Bloc is made up of DP, the principal party; three-time presidential candidate Abed Bwanika s People s Development Party (PDP); former Makindye East MP Michael Mabikke s Social Democratic Party (SDP); and a group led by former presidential candidate Samuel Lubega. DP president-general Norbert Mao largely played the role of facilitator at the function where several speakers threw jibes at Dr Besigye, who on the same day, was in Kabale District on his mobilisation drive.Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, who has in the past referred to Dr Besigye as his mentor, delivered his fiercest sting to-date against the four-time presidential candidate. For close to a year, supporters of Mr Kyagulanyi and Dr Besigye have fought what was sometimes a vicious war, mainly on social media, but the two men remained largely civil towards each other except on a few occasions when the daggers seemed to be drawn. The first incident was during the last day of campaigns for the Arua Municipality by-election in August last year in which the two men supported different candidates. Mr Kyagulanyi was in a procession with eventual winner Kassiano Wadri when their crowd came face-to-face with the rally of Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) candidate Bruce Musema, which Dr Besigye was addressing. Mr Kyagulanyi, standing atop his vehicle amid blaring music, signaled the people Dr Besigye was addressing to join his group. Dr Besigye urged his crowd to ignore the other crowd and paused, until Mr Kyagulanyi strolled away and the rally continued. Mr Kyagulany s group would later get into an altercation with presidential guards, which resulted in the shooting to death of his driver, Yasin Kawuma. Presidential security claimed that people in Mr Kyagulanyi s crowd stopped one of the cars in the presidential motorcade as the President made his way to the airstrip after addressing the rally of his party s candidate in the race, Ms Nusura Tiperu. Mr Kyagulanyi, Mr Wadri and more than 30 others were arrested and charged with treason over the issue. Then on Boxing Day last year, the police blocked Mr Kyagulanyi from staging a musical concert at his beach in Busabala, Wakiso District. In the heat of the moment, Mr Kyagulanyi bemoaned the persecution that he said the government had put him through, pointing out that some Opposition players run petrol stations and they have never been closed.The comment was interpreted as meant for Dr Besigye, who operates a petrol station in Nsambya, Kampala. Mr Kyagulanyi, however, also operates small petrol stations in Gomba and Butambala districts, in addition to a recording studio and other businesses, which too had not been shut down.This prompted a response from Dr Besigye s supporters, who pointed out that when their man started opposing President Museveni and fled to exile, his brother, Joseph Musasizi, who was running his petrol station and other businesses, was arrested and charged with treason and murder. He stayed locked up for years and, Dr Besigye says, Musasizi s leukemia got out of hand because it could not be managed in prison. He died shortly after being released.Fresh attacksDespite those incidences, Dr Besigye and Mr Kyagulanyi had largely stayed civil towards each other in the public space until the Africana meeting when Mr Kyagulanyi pulled off the gloves. He said he had  concluded that some members in the Opposition are only concerned about their positions and will fight any composition that threatens their positions . Mr Kyagulanyi added:  Don t talk about democracy and stand four times and on the fifth time you tell people democracy doesn t work. We believe it works. On that point, I will assert that democracy actually works and anybody who despises democracy is despising the people of Uganda. Mr Kyagulanyi s comments were in reference to prior statements by Dr Besigye, who has on various occasions said President Museveni will not easily leave power even if he is defeated at the polls, like he claims he defeated him in 2016 and earlier. Moments after Mr Kyagulanyi made the comments critical of Dr Besigye, Mr Daniel Muwonge, who backs Dr Besigye, posted on Facebook:  Two years ago, in Kyadondo (East) by-elections, Besigye s picture was used as symbol of unity and strength, by the same man who has today called Besigye all sorts of names. Struggle continues.  Mr Muwonge posted a picture of Mr Kyagulanyi s campaign poster, with the picture of the youthful legislator sandwiched by that of Dr Besigye to the right and Kampala Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago to the left.Enter BwanikaBefore Mr Kyagulanyi spoke, Dr Bwanika had his go at Dr Besigye. Dr Bwanika said:  I have heard one person who has now perpetually become a presidential candidate and wants to become one again. I have decided, whether I will remain alone, I will ensure that Ugandans don t vote that presidential candidate again. I will work on it. It is my mandate because I am aware he is not among those who are coming; he is among those who are going. Therefore, we will not give him space again. In all the three times (2006, 2011 and 2016), Dr Bwanika has run as a presidential candidate, he has contested with Dr Besigye. Dr Besigye has on all occasions been the main challenger against Mr Museveni and Dr Bwanika an also-run. But bad blood has always flowed against the two men, with Dr Bwanika ever on the offensive, while Dr Besigye s backers accuse him of working for President Museveni from within the Opposition. After the 2006 election, another bitterly contested election, Dr Besigye went to court to challenge Mr Museveni s victory. Dr Bwanika, who was a candidate in the same election, swore an affidavit in support of Mr Museveni s victory.   I read and heard from the media that one of the candidates had since petitioned court challenging the outcome of the election and as a Born-Again Christian and peace-loving Ugandan, who is interested in the rule of law and democracy, I deem it my duty to come forward and state what I know to be true about the election,  Dr Bwanika s affidavit reads in part. The candidate Dr Bwanika referred to was Dr Besigye. Since then, Dr Besigye s backers accuse him of being a fifth columnist within the Opposition ranks. In the last election, Dr Besigye kept receiving money from his supporters across the country. During a rally in Luweero, Dr Bwanika took on the voters, asking them why they don t give their fellow Muganda (Bwanika) money and support yet they gave it to Dr Besigye (who is not a Muganda). He repeated the charges in a few other places. Dr Besigye and his team have also pointed at comments Dr Bwanika makes on a talk show on Buganda Kingdom-owned radio, Central Broadcasting Service (CBS) fm and accused him of promoting tribalism within the Opposition ranks. In December last year, Dr Besigye said a catchphrase Mr Kyagulanyi introduced   Mwebereremu (fight for yourselves)   had tribal intonations. This was interpreted as an attack on Mr Kyagulanyi. Dr Besigye quickly issued an apology for the  misunderstanding , and later explained that his reference was to the way Dr Bwanika uses the word to address Baganda on CBS radio.Mao, Mabikke and Muntu On his part, Mr Mao, who ran for president in 2011 and came a distant third as Dr Besigye was again the closest to President Museveni, did not deploy his oratory skills at great length but ensured his message was concisely delivered. Mr Mao said to Mr Kyagulanyi:  We are very happy that you have jumped into the pool and you are causing displacement, which is not a bad thing, after all when our leaders become misleaders and our mentors become tormentors and freedom of expression becomes a target of oppression, then opposition becomes our position.  Mr Mao was partly referencing lyrics of one Mr Kyagulanyi s hit songs. Mr Kyagulanyi has previously referred to Dr Besigye his mentor. Another co-principal in the DP bloc, Mr Mabikke, also had a message of his own.  For too long, the centre stage in the Opposition has been dominated by mediocre leadership. They are not up to the task; they are no match to the challenge we confront; they have got no ideas; and they have no plans but just want to stick at the helm,  Mr Mabikke said.Former FDC president, Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu, was also in attendance, invited as a guest, just like Mr Kyagulanyi and Jeema president Asuman Basalirwa. Gen Muntu and Mr Basalirwa did not aim barbs at Dr Besigye or any other Opposition player.Besigye activities At the end of 2018, Dr Besigye declared 2019  the year of action , vowing to intensify mobilisation against President Museveni, with the objective of forcing him out of power before the 2021 election. Dr Besigye insists that he won the 2016 election and that Mr Museveni is in office illegally.To break the impasse that followed the 2016 election, different groups tried to broker talks between Mr Museveni and Dr Besigye, and Dr Besigye put carrying out an audit of the 2016 election as one of the conditions. Papers were drafted for the two principals to sign and at different points, the mediators were cautiously optimistic that talks could happen, but the process eventually collapsed. President Museveni got on a programme of his own and efforts to remove the age limit for presidential candidates gained currency on the one hand, while on the other hand Dr Besigye went underground building structures to further his politics. In February, Dr Besigye launched what he calls the People s Assembly, the equivalent of a parliament for his People s Government, which he established when he declared himself winner of the 2016 election and a video of him being  sworn-in  as president surfaced on social media on the eve of President Museveni s swearing-in on May 12, 2016. After launching the People s Assembly at a national level, Dr Besigye and his allies have proceeded to launch regional assemblies simultaneously in the different regions of the country, and say they have a plan to launch assemblies further down to districts, sub-counties and villages. The assemblies being launched are composed of people mobilised through covert activities over two years. In all these activities, Dr Besigye enjoys the backing of the FDC-led by Mr Patrick Amuriat, who had one of his key promises during the campaign for the party s leadership  to reclaim our (2016) victory . Dr Besigye also enjoys the backing of non-FDC members like Mr Lukwago, who is the vice president of the People s Government, and Mukono Municipality MP Betty Nambooze, who is the spokesperson of the People s Government. To become FDC president, Mr Amuriat defeated Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu in a fallout that eventually saw Gen Muntu quit the party and is in the process of forming another party, the Alliance for National Transformation (ANT). Gen Muntu also attended the DP Bloc signing ceremony on Thursday and was later that evening the guest on NTV s  On the Spot  programme. On all occasions, he steered clear of attacking Dr Besigye or any Opposition player.On Thursday, Dr Besigye clashed with the police, but eventually held processions through the town and addressed his supporters in the council hall of Hamurwa Town Council, Rubanda District. This was after the police blocked him from addressing rallies that had been planned to happen at Hamurwa and Bubare playgrounds.Explaining the decision to block the outdoor rallies, Mr Ramathan Tai, the Rubanda District police commander, said:  The permission that was granted to them was to hold an indoor meeting, but not a public rally. That is why we never allowed them to hold one. Making of the DP bloc The DP Bloc started with the grand union in which former members and those affiliated to the party, were supposed to return to the Norbert Mao-led group. On May 23, 2018, the party held a grand union at Makerere University and invited local and international guests. While the international guests on the invitation list, such as Dr Klaus Schuller, the managing director of Germany s Christian Democratic Union, opposition leaders Raila Odinga (Kenya) , Mr Nelson Chamisa (Zimbabwe), former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, Mr Fikile Mbalula from South Africa and Dr Paul Williams from UK, made no show despite the party confirming their presence, several local politicians attended. These included former Leader of the Opposition in Parliament Winnie Kizza, former FDC president, Maj Gen (Rtd) Mugisha Muntu, Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, Jeema president Asumani Basalirwa and PDP president Abedi Bwanika.More reunion fetes were lined up, but so far, less than a handful have happened, including one in Masaka and Mukono. The Masaka event was characterised by violence from supporters allied to warring members, forcing Mr Mao to suspend the events, citing hooliganism.In February, police blocked the reunion event organised in Jinja Town. The party had since gone silent on the activity until the April 4, MoU signing ceremony.

3,"Mambule, where  old cars get new life - Daily Monitor","Different makes, brands and models are piled on top of one another in different stages of their death. Hovering around are scrap dealers waiting to grab the skeleton leftovers. Welcome to Mambule car graveyard in Bwaise, Kawempe Division, Kampala. Car wreckages are collected from all over the country and deposited here for their last days as they are ripped apart one piece after the other until the final remains are taken to a steel milling factory for their epitaph. It is from here that a car is dismantles and its parts are scattered in the East African region and beyond. Traders come from as far as DRC, Kenya, Tanzania, and Southern Sudan looking for spare parts. How it startedWhat started more than 40 years ago as a sole proprietorship has given birth to a whole industry, creating hundreds of direct jobs and thousands more indirectly. Having started from a small piece of land less than a 10x10ft on the defunct Mambule Road, the graveyard now covers several acres. It has now grown into an association of traders; Mambule Road Spare Parts Trader s Association. According to the association s defence secretary, Salongo Kadali, as the number of traders and cars increased, there was need to form an association to unite them in the business.  This business was started by the late Mohammed Mugalu more than 40 years ago. He started by buying accident car wreckages and other government cars sold under auction once they were written off the road.  With Mugalu s death, the business suffered for some time before Fred Luboyera, also deceased, revived it.  When Luboyera came in, he was buying cars, some of them in working condition and resold them as spare parts,  Kadali says. It was during Luboyera s time that the trade attracted more people and it grew into what it is today. There is a silver lining in every dark cloud. When Kiseka Market in downtown Kampala closed for redevelopment, it was a windfall for spare parts traders and landlords on Mambule Road.  A sizeable number of Kiseka Market traders moved here and as a result, rent prices increased,  Kadali says. Even before the ongoing developments, Mambule Road was a supplier of spare parts to Kiseka Market.  Old car parts were collected from here by Kiseka Market traders, who would clean them up and present them as either new or reconditioned from Japan or Dubai, United Arab Emirates,  Kadali reveals.Sources of the carsIt is difficult to know the exact number of vehicles received at Mambule car graveyard per month because the leaders do not document it. But one thing the management of the graveyard is sure about is that the bulk of them have real value for money.  About 70 per cent of the cars we receive here are accident wreckages. As police statistics indicate, most of the accidents are due to reckless driving. Old cars are hardly driven recklessly as compared to cars in sound condition, which are driven recklessly and thus the accidents. As a result, their spares parts are always in good working condition, save for the damaged parts, which are mostly external,  Kadali says.Since majority of the cars are accident wreckages, police comes into the picture. But the police don t come to them looking for market, although it is the main source of such cars. There are brokers who monitor such cars at different police stations and even follow them through the court processes. We get most of these cars from police stations all over the country. We pay for them through the courts, and present the receipts at the concerned police station before we tow the car here,  Isma Makumbi, the chairman of the association, says.However, not all cars are accident wreckages. Some cars are got directly from the owners  homes.  There are some cars we get from people s homes after they had been grounded for some time, while others are got from government parking yards after they are auctioned to us,  Kadali says.Unlike other car buyers, the spare parts dealers at Mambule car graveyard value the cars they buy based on the resalable parts left of them. As a result, it is not possible to fix a particular price.  When buying these cars, we value them from the smallest part of the car that we can sell off it. It is possible to buy a Toyota Harrier at Shs4m and buy a Toyota Probox at Shs7m. This is in such cases where the Harrier may be more damaged than the Probox.  There are also incidences where owners approach them with offers to sell to them their car wreckages. In such cases, Makumbi says they have ground rules to follow before a purchase is made.  In such cases, the seller must produce the original logbook in their name and the number plate. Where the logbook is not in the seller s name, he or she must present an original sale agreement with the person whose name appear in the logbook, without which we don t buy the car,  Kadali explains.A walk through the yard reveals that some car wreckages still have number plates, while others don t.  When buying an accident car wreckage, police retain the number plates, while the ones bought from individuals are brought with their number plates and after the car has been ripped and sold, the number plates are returned to police,  Makumbi explains.Some car models brought to the graveyard are too old and considered outdated. However, Kadali says some car models considered outdated in Uganda have their spare parts much sought after by trades from Kenya and Tanzania.  For instance, Kadali explains:  Once upon a time, the Toyota 1200 pick-up truck was the in thing, especially for town errands. However, with the introduction of K-trucks which are more fuel efficient and carry more goods, the pick-up 1200 was pushed off the road. The same happened to the Sahara pick-ups. They were pushed off the market by the Town Ace for the same reason as the pickups 1200. ChallengesChaos of car ownership. Just like any other business dealing in old and wrecked vehicles, Mambule car graveyard has also got its own challenges. According to Kadali, despite the strict ground rules to be followed before they buy a car from somebody, they still get incidences such as buying stolen cars.He cites an incident where a woman allegedly sold a car to them, only for the husband to turn up with police looking for the same car, now reported as stolen. It turned out that the woman sold the car without the man s consent.  In most cases, such incidences go to court and the case drags on for long. As businessmen, sometimes we fail to appear in court all the time and we end up losing our money just like that,  Kadali says.Besides cases like the aforementioned, the managers have also had to deal with cases where two people claim ownership of the same car and each has a  genuine  logbook. In some cases, they have had stolen cars with changed number plates. Makumbi says in such cases, they strike a win-win deal with the authorities.  Once a car is proved to have been stolen, we work with the authorities to ensure that neither of the parties loses. The car is returned to the owner and police helps us recover our money,  he says.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Mambule-old-cars-Kawempe--Spare-Parts-DRC/688334-5058948-g7ilwyz/index.html
4,Court orders university to reinstate People Power candidate in guild race - Daily Monitor,"The Gulu High Court has ordered Gulu University to reinstate Mr Imuran Ntambazi to contest for the position of Guild President at the institution.Mr Ntambazi, was among four other students at the university who last month expressed interest to run for the leadership of the students  body.The Second year Bachelors of Computer Science student, was, however, blocked from being nominated for the race on March 23, by the Dean of Students on allegations that he was not a fully registered student at the university.It was also alleged that Mr Ntambazi s nomination was blocked because he identified himself with the People Power Movement, a rising political group associated with the Kyadondo East Member of Parliament, Mr Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine.Through his lawyer, Mr  Lastone Gulume, Mr Ntambazi sued Gulu University for unfairly blocking him arguing that the action would ruin  his political ambitions.Mr Ntambazi also applied to court to suspend the elections which were scheduled to take place on April 7.The Gulu High Court Deputy Registrar, Mr Rose Mary Bareebe had on Wednesday asked the two parties [Mr Ntambazi and Gulu University] to settle the matter out of court arguing that the ruling might not favour any of them.However, in a Thursday ruling, Ms Bareebe ordered Gulu University to reinstate Mr Ntambazi to participate and contest for the guild presidency.She ordered that with the exception of the requisite fees, Mr Ntambazi should undertake and fulfil all the other requisites for his nomination and eventual participation in the Guild elections as outlined by the Guild Electoral Commission.Ms Bareebe also ordered the applicant not to affiliate with any political party or partisan body which negatively portrays the image of Gulu University. Prior to and during the nomination processes, the applicant shall neither affiliate to any political party nor any partisan body which shall negatively portray the image of the University and neither shall the applicant associate with or promote rowdy movements at the University. Contravention of the above may lead to the cancellation of his participation in the electoral process,  Ms Bareebe ruled.Mr Gulume, however, said from his the interpretation of the court ruling, his client is only bared from participating in partisan politics before nomination arguing that after his successful nomination, he is free to join any political group. The order limits association to the stage of prior to and during the nomination process. This in my view doesn t extend to the campaigning stage which is a post nomination process leading to the elections,  Mr Gulume said.He said that his client will have to get recommendations from the University academic registrar and the Dean of Students before being nominated.Others in the race are Mr Alexander Okidi, a second-year student of Development Studies, Mr Samuel Oyet Agwani, a second- year student of  Arts in Education, Mr Johnson Nowe, a third year Medicine & Surgery student and Mr Moses Etyak, a second- year student of Computer Science.Court also ordered both parties to meet their own costs and extended the guild elections to April 13 to enable Mr Ntambazi to participate.

5,Radio switched off air after hosting Besigye - Daily Monitor,"Security personnel on Thursday night switched off Hope Radio in Kabale municipality after it hosted Forum for Democratic Change stalwart Dr Kiiza Besigye and other party leaders.The others were; Ingrid Turinawe, Patrick Amuriat Oboi, William Nzoghu, the Busongora North MP and Roland Mugume Kaginda, the MP Rukungiri Municipality. These had spent a day in Rubanda District launching the revival of the party s grass root mobilisation campaign. The talk show which was expected to last for two hours lasted for only 30 minutes.Mr Allan Twongyeirwe, the host, said that before the show started, he received a phone call from Mr Darius Nandiinda, the Kabale Resident District Commissioner ordering him not to host the FDC leaders. He said that Mr Nandiinda had ordered Uganda People Defense Forces (UPDF) soldiers at 19th Battalion at Kihumuro hill in Kabale, which host radio transmitters and masts in the area, to switch off Hope radio in case it insists on hosting FDC leaders.Dr Joseph Tindyebwa, the FDC Deputy National Secretary General in Charge of Policy and Research says that the radio was switched off when Besigye was explaining how former Hong Kong Home Affairs minister Patrick Ho Chi-ping was recently handed a three-year sentence in United States of America after he was found guilty of offering a $500,000 bribe to Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kutesa and $2 million to Chad's President Idriss Deby. Dr Besigye told Daily Monitor on Friday that even before the programme started, he was informed by the host that it might be interrupted. Midway the program, power went off and the program was interrupted for some time as they switched on the standby generator. We were back on air for another about 10 minutes and the radio shut down. We were subsequently informed that it had been switched off from the mast. I have been informed that a minutes after we left, the radio was switched on again,  he said.Mr Nandiinda declined to comment on the matter when contacted.Past incidentsIn September 2017, Mr Besigye was blocked from entering voice of Kigezi for a live show on land matters. Radio Management argued that they had been directed by Mr Nandiinda not to allow him to appear on the airwaves. In July 2015, the MP for Jinja Municipality West Moses Balyeku ordered staff at his Baba FM to switch off the radio station which had started to transmit a live talk show where Mr Besigye had gone to feature as a guest. In November 2009, Besigye was blocked from appearing on Nenah FM in Karamoja to address the public. In May 2007, the Kitgum-based Kitti FM was switched off air 30 minutes after Besigye had started speaking on the radio s talk-show. The radio s generator was switched off, reportedly on the orders of the then area RDC.Additional reporting by URN",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Radio-switched-off-air-after-hosting-Besigye/688334-5057942-f0ukl2z/index.html
6,Macron names experts to probe French action during Rwanda genocide - Daily Monitor,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday appointed a panel of experts to investigate France's actions in Rwanda during the country's genocide 25 years ago, a subject that has dogged Franco-Rwandan relations since the 1994 massacres.The commission of eight researchers and historians ""will be tasked with consulting all France's archives relating to the genocide... in order to analyse the role and engagement of France during that period,"" the presidency said in a statement.The commission will look at the period from 1990 to 1994 to ""contribute to a better understanding and knowledge of the genocide of Tutsis,"" the statement said.The findings will be used in material used to teach people in France about the genocide, it added.Rwanda has accused France of being complicit in the genocide of an estimated 800,000 mostly ethnic Tutsis through its support for the Hutu-led government of the day.It also accuses the French forces who were stationed in Rwanda under a UN mandate of having helped some of the perpetrators to escape, with some seeking sanctuary in France.Paris has consistently denied complicity in the bloodletting, which has cast a long shadow over Franco-Rwandan relations, leading Rwanda at one point to break off ties for three years.Relations have improved in the past decade.But Macron caused disappointment among genocide survivors by turning down an invitation to attend this weekend's genocide commemorations in Rwanda.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Macron-names-experts-probe-French-action-Rwanda-genocide/688334-5058300-ah3cihz/index.html
7,Libya in chaos since 2011 overthrow of Gadhafi - Daily Monitor,"Libya has been mired in chaos since the ouster and killing of dictator Muamer Gadhafi in 2011, with two rival authorities and a multitude of militias vying for control of the oil-rich country.Strongman Khalifa Haftar's forces were pushed back Friday from a key checkpoint less than 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Tripoli, checking their lightning advance on the capital, seat of the country's internationally recognised unity government.Haftar supports a parallel administration based in the east.Here is a timeline of the Mediterranean country's descent into turmoil: Kadhafi killed Triggered by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, demonstrations erupt in Libya in February 2011. A coalition led by Washington, Paris and London lends its backing to an armed revolt. Gadhafi, in power for 42 years, flees the capital. He is captured and killed on October 20, 2011 during a battle for his hometown Sirte, east of Tripoli.Three days later, the rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) declares Libya's ""total liberation"".In August 2012 the NTC hands power to a transitional authority elected a month earlier -- the General National Congress (GNC). Embassies targeted US ambassador Chris Stevens and three American staff are killed in a September 11, 2012 attack on their consulate in Libya's second city Benghazi. An Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group is blamed.A car bomb in April 2013 targets France's embassy in Tripoli, wounding two French guards.Most foreign delegations withdraw from the country.Rival governmentsDissident army general Haftar launches an offensive in May 2014 against jihadist groups in Benghazi. He is backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Several military officers from the east join his self-styled Libyan National Army.As nationalists and Islamists vie for power, legislative elections are held in June and the GNC is replaced by a parliament dominated by anti-Islamists.Islamist-led militias contest the results and group under the banner of ""Fajr Libya"" (Libya Dawn). They storm Tripoli in August, installing their own ""national salvation"" government and restoring the GNC.The elected house, which has international recognition, takes refuge in the eastern city of Tobruk near the border with Egypt.Thus the country finds itself with two governments and two parliaments.After months of negotiations and international pressure, lawmakers from the rival parliaments sign an accord in December 2015 in Morocco to set up a UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA).In March 2016, GNA chief Fayez al-Sarraj arrives in Tripoli to set up the new government, but Haftar's rival administration refuses to recognise its authority.Peace talks, armed groups In July 2017, Sarraj and Haftar meet for talks near Paris where they agree to a ceasefire and commit to elections the following year.In May 2018, weeks after suicide attackers from the Islamic State group kill 14 people at Libya's electoral commission, the two men meet again in the French capital and commit to holding parliamentary and presidential polls at the end of the year.In June 2018, a militia attacks two northeastern oil sites under Haftar's control through which oil is exported.After days of fighting, Haftar's forces announce they are back in ""full control"" and have also seized the city of Derna from radical Islamists.In January 2019 Haftar launches an offensive into oil-rich southern Libya, ostensibly aimed at wiping out ""terrorists"" and criminal groups. His forces seize the region's capital Sebha and one of the country's main oil fields without a fight. Conferences On February 28 the UN says Libya's rivals have met and agreed to hold polls.In March the UN says it will organise an all-party conference the next month to draw up a ""road map"" for Libya, including setting dates for legislative and presidential elections.Later in March the African Union says it will host a ""reconciliation"" conference in July aimed at uniting Libya's political rivals.Advance on TripoliOn Wednesday, Haftar's forces announce they are gearing up to move on the west of the country including Tripoli.A day later powerful armed groups from the western city of Misrata, loyal to the Tripoli government, vow to block the threatened advance.UN chief Antonio Guterres expresses deep concern over the risk of a major flare-up in Libya.Haftar orders his troops to advance on Tripoli, saying ""the time has come"".The strongman's forces seize a key security barrier within 27 kilometres of the capital later that day without any fighting, General Abdessalem al-Hassi says.But on Friday, a security source says militiamen from the nearby coastal town of Zawiya retake the base after ""a short exchange of fire"".",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Libya-2011-overthrow-Gadhafi-Mediterranean-Tunisia/688340-5058520-gayfr1z/index.html
8,US revokes visa for ICC prosecutor Bensouda - Daily Monitor,"The United States has revoked the visa for the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, her office said Friday, over a possible investigation of American soldiers' actions in Afghanistan.Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda would continue to pursue her duties for the Hague-based court ""without fear or favour"" despite the ban, her office said in a statement.The move against Bensouda, a Gambian national, comes weeks after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced restrictions on ICC staff who probe US or allied personnel.""What we can confirm is that the US authorities have revoked the prosecutor's visa for entry into the US,"" the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC said in a statement.Bensouda's office said that under the Rome statute governing the ICC -- which Washington has declined to join since it was set up in 2002 -- she had an ""independent and impartial mandate"".""The prosecutor and her office will continue to undertake that statutory duty with utmost commitment and professionalism, without fear or favour,"" it added.The US decision was not expected to impact Bensouda if she is travelling to the United Nations in New York where she gives regular briefings to the UN Security Council on investigation, it said.There was no immediate comment on Bensouda's visa ban from Washington.Bensouda asked ICC judges in November 2017 for authorisation to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan by the Taliban, Afghan government forces and international forces including US troops.The court has not yet decided whether to launch a full-blown probe.However, the administration of US President Donald Trump has struck preemptively, with Pompeo warning on March 15 that the ICC was ""attacking America's rule of law"".Pompeo said he was ""announcing a policy of US visa restrictions on those individuals directly responsible for any ICC investigation of US personnel.""""If you're responsible for the proposed ICC investigation of US personnel in connection with the situation in Afghanistan you should not assume that you still have, or will get, a visa or that you will permitted to enter the United States,"" Pompeo added.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/US-revokes-entry-visA-ICC-prosecutor-Bensouda-Afghan-probe/688340-5058162-w5u23z/index.html

It does not matter what state or district you are in. It won t change much if you are poor. What is important is to work towards eradicating poverty and improving your income,  the press statement quoted President Museveni.President Museveni said if they must, it would be best to follow the colonial boundaries for both internal and inter-state demarcations in order to ensure peace.President Kiir was accompanied by, among others, the current minister in the Office of the President, Mr Mayik Ayii Deng.Uganda s minister of Foreign Affairs Sam Kutesa and Presidency minister Esther Mbayo were also present.

10,"2021 polls: Bobi Wine, Muntu, Mao call for united Opposition - Daily Monitor","Kampala. Opposition leaders have called for a joint force to eject President Museveni out of power come 2021.The leaders that include Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu, the Alliance for National Transformation (ANT) party leader, Mr Norbert Mao, the DP president general and Kyadondo East Member of Parliament Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, said they can only put up a formidable fight against the incumbent if they are united. What we are building today is like a skyscraper and if you are building something, you must have a plan which we have kicked off today,  said Mr Mao. This is a day of accountability and reaping what we have been sowing together. We give glory to God because he said there is time for everything,  he added.PreparationMr Mao was speaking shortly after the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party and People s Development Party to form what they called a strong DP Bloc.Before the union, SDP was led by former Makindye East MP, Mr Michael Mabikke, while PDP was commanded by Mr Abed Bwanika. This MoU is aimed at settling all the differences within the DP.Early this year, DP, SDP and PDP formed an alliance dubbed DP Bloc with the aim to take on the ruling government.DP Bloc also launched a strategy dubbed One-to-One model ahead of the 2021 General Election with the purpose of fronting a single Opposition candidate in all positions across the country. Mr Mao said with a formidable force, President Museveni will be history. I thank our elders who walk with us led by Dr Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere, for promoting unity not only in DP but in all political parties we interact with,  he said Mr Mao revealed that Dr Ssemogerere was also disturbed by the acrimony in the Opposition ranks and compared them to a hospital where a patient on the verge of death is brought to the hospital where doctors with divergent views engage in quarrels instead of focusing on saving a life.President Museveni has already been endorsed by the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) Caucus and Central Executive Committee (CEC) and expected to run for a sixth elective term of office in 2021. Mr Kyagulanyi reminded the Opposition that time for boardroom politics was over.He said only a united Opposition would take the country forward.   If we come together, we can survive but if we fail, be sure that we shall perish together. Since we know that we are entitled to fight for the country and to have what we want, we must have the good will of the majority of the people,  he said. Mr Kyagulanyi also asked Opposition political leaders not to waste more time fighting each other.Gen Muntu said :  Considering what we have gone through as a country, conflicts and blood shed, the current situation that we are involved in always lacked united efforts of all people who believe in those values and it s unfortunate that we are still failing to build it and become the foundation of good governance in this country.

11,Uganda Development Corporation gets new boss - Daily Monitor,"Mr Patrick Bitonder Birungi has been appointed the executive director of Uganda Development Corporation (UDC). He replaces Mr Emmanuel Mutahunga who has been acting in that position for about two years. Until his appointment, Mr Patrick Birungi was the director Development Planning at the National Planning Authority (NPA). Before joining the government planning agency in 2010, he worked in the academia and then with United Nation Development Programme, all in senior positions. Mr Birungi, an economist by profession, also has a wide experience in research as exemplified by his role in key economic policies. He was part of the team that conducted Presidential Economic Council (PEC) paper on recapitalizing the Uganda Development Bank. He played the same role on youth employment as well the mineral development in Uganda. He was also the team leader for the development of the National Development Plan III and before that team leader for the production of the National Development Plan II.Although some of his critics are in awe of his public service record, most of them are unsure of whether his amiable experience in academia, United Nation and government is sufficient enough to see him negotiate a terrain that could have required a driver with a private sector navigation license. Meanwhile, Mr Mutahunga returns to his previous position as the assistant commissioner in charge of external trade at the ministry of trade, industry and cooperative.

12,"I do not regret becoming a teacher, despite poor pay - Daily Monitor","Teachers complain about little pay and in fact this has discouraged a number of people from joining the profession. Not for Joviah Nyakwera. The teacher is proud of her choice of profession. Nyakwera describes her 12-year experience in teaching as an amazing journey, which she would love to end only on retirement. A number of teachers are in the profession but do not like their work. I am grateful for what I am. Through teaching I have been exposed to people from different walks of life and I have been able to influence their lives positively,  she says. Born to Yofesi Ndoleriire of Rubona Bunyangabu, Nyakwera says she was inspired to join the profession by her parents who were both teachers.She recalls being taught while at home something she attributes her love for teaching to.  I always spare time to revise with my children. This helps me discover their strengths but also weaknesses in learning,  she says.Nyakwera joined school in 1989 at Rubona Primary School and after completing Primary Seven, she joined Kahinju Secondary School in Fort Portal for O-Level.While at Kahinju, she was drawn further to teaching after seeing the commitment and selfless attitude that her teachers displayed. My teachers were a great inspiration. Some would even sacrifice their leisure time just to give us extra lessons on hard concepts which we would not have grasped during lessons,  she says adding that this selfless attitude is what has made some teachers influential people.In 2000, Nyakwera joined Progressive Secondary School, Wandegeya for A-Level with History, Economics, Geography and Divinity as her subject combination.She later enrolled for a Bachelors of Arts in Education at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. This was a dream come true considering she was enrolling for a course that she had longed to pursue.In 2004, after her graduation, Nyakwera started her teaching journey at Kaboyo Secondary School in Kabarole District. She was not employed on fulltime basis but it did not stop her from doing her job well.  I used to wake up early in the morning and be at school on time regardless of the little pay I was getting,  she recalls. In all this, her joy was seeing her students excel and move on to the next level. Diversifying She was at Kaboyo until 2010 when she was transferred to Kibiito Senior Secondary School to teach History and Divinity in Senior Four and Senior Six.She wanted to diversify. And so she applied to become an examiner for Senior Four History at Uneb in 2009. This is a decision Nyakwera does not regret. She says becoming an examiner has helped her learn many ideas thus helping her get more students to pass her subject.  I have learnt how they mark at Uneb and what they consider during marking,  she notes. In 2012, Nyakwera was transferred to Nyarukoma Secondary School in Kyenjonjo District as a teacher on government payroll. She was there for two years until the administration of Kibiito Secondary School asked for her services again. In 2014, she returned to Kibiito Secondary School but alongside teaching, she became the senior woman. This, she says, made her realise that students have several issues that teachers need to address so that they are nurtured and attain a holistic education. Students have so many issues that affect their daily lives. They range from physical, social to physiological. If not addressed, it becomes hard for the students to perform well. Important to note is that as teachers, we have a big role to play in these student s lives since we spend a lot of time with them, compared to their parents,  she explains.Growing careerNyakwera is now the deputy head teacher in charge of general duties at the school. Despite teaching the candidate classes, she spares time to interact with the students and through this, she finds out the major challenges that are affecting students and finds possible ways to solve them. To get expertise on this, Nyakwera has enrolled for a Masters in Counselling Psychology at Uganda Martyrs University, Nkozi. To her, a good teacher is supposed to provide counselling and guidance to the students.Asked about some of the challenges affecting the teaching profession, Nyakwera says the greatest is teachers who join the profession as the last option, as well as businessmen who open schools and have led to unhealthy competition among schools. These business people are not interested in the kind of students their school churns out. They are only interested in instant results so as to attract more numbers in their schools. This has led to high level of malpractices in schools,  she observes.Nyakwera says for a teacher to excel in teaching, they need to be selfless, patient, hardworking and committed. And athough the salary may not be that much, she say there is nothing as gratifying as a teacher seeing their students excelling in future.Voices Nyakwera is a teacher that is very determined to get results. She is good at engaging parents so as to make sure that her students get help both at home and at school. Gwendolyn Kanyomozi, teacher She is self-driven and patient with her students. She is also a good counsellor who always engages students to make sure they are on the right track. Moses Rubalema, lecturer, Mountains of the Moon University She is strict and does not tolerate laziness. But it is her being strict that has modelled me into what I am today. She does not want to see any of her students fail.

13,When suicide hits close to home - Daily Monitor,"This year has been dotted with digitally announced suicides.After writing several suicidal messages on his Facebook page and WhatsApp status, Arthur Basalirwa, a first class graduate of Makerere University Business school (MUBS) committed suicide on March 20, 2019.Judging by the way the stream of thoughts begin, he had already made up his mind and by the time anyone could notice, it was already too late.Two days later in Kenya, a woman posted two suicide notes to her daughter and father on Facebook before her body was found dangling from the rafter of a store.Her suicide note to her daughter read:  My love  .words are hard to form a perfect clause to express the love I have for you. I have fought the battle but seems like am being defeated ..I only pray that God may give you guidance, love and comfort. Mom still loves you and will always love you. Kindly do forgive me. Her note to her father read:  Dad, I am sorry, but I am not able to break the news that I am about to commit suicide. I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive me. Earlier this month, a 20-year-old student at Meru National Polytechnic in Kenya recorded herself as she swallowed multiple tablets in an apparent suicide.SOCIAL MEDIA TROLLSSocial media has become a home for trolls and depressives alike, not a good mix. How can we take any person seriously  In February, another Kenyan student committed suicide after his Facebook friends encouraged him to end his life when he made suicidal posts.Still, in February, Facebook deleted the account of a Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (Jkuat) graduate, hours after he had posted a suicide alert.These and similar events signal a trend that suicidal sentiments are tweeted.ENDING SUICIDEBut to bring this trend to an end, Ugandans on Twitter have joined the conversation on fighting suicide. A one @fredkwesiga tweeted:  Last week as I was coming from a restaurant one of the waiters told me,  I can throw my self in front of a moving car right now  as we were crossing the road. This got me thinking- why she would want to do such a thing. Turns out she was soo depressed. Forget about the memes and the petty fights between for a few likes and retweets, this is real talk. The truth is Life is full of f**ked up hardships and there s no escape from it but what s important is how we deal with it. Cynicism poisons your mind. Eventually, you cant see the good in anyone or anything. Believe in better days most importantly YOURSELF,  @dilaronny added to the thread.DIFFERENT SIGNALSThe difference in suicide in the past and the present is technology. Back then, suicide note would be discovered on pen and paper after the person is already gone, unlike today where people send signals that can be noticed with their social media usage.Unfortunately, close friends or family rarely notice these signals. It is usually after the person has taken their life that people look back at what the person posted that they begin to relate.Which is why Martha Kay, a social media influencer and entertainer called on people to check on their friends often.  Please check on your friends, talk to them, make them feel loved, give them more reason to stay alive. Suicide is not the solution,  she said in a tweet.As messages began to pour in on the Hashtag, some people began to open up. Evans Stark  shared how he tried to end his life three years ago and left a word of encouragement for those who are facing a difficult situation. As I said earlier this month. When I was depressed 3yrs back I could shade tears like 5 times before I sleep, it went on for something like 2 years. I tried to commit suicide many times until I talked to my brother & a doctor. It made me feel like I was born again. Owing to the fact that tweeps crack a lot of jokes, @SamaEmme cautioned that suicide was not something to joke about.  And let s not joke about suicide. Let s not use it to threaten people or drive public sympathy. The day you re serious about it people will think it s the usual and that s how we will lose you  Leah Tuhame encouraged people to seek help from as many people as possible. I know that the 1st person might not understand why you want to end your life. Try to talk to as many people as possible. Don t be ashamed or embarrassed with fear when depressed. Try seeking help, It is normal. FEAR TO BE JUDGEDMuch as most of the tweets on the Hashtag encouraged people to reach out to others for help as well as reaching out to help others, some tweeps expressed their fears about seeking help.@philipocollins said that he has regretted all the times he has reached out to others for help because he was judged instead of being helped. You know, it s funny that most of the tweets with the tag #LetsEndSuicide speak about reaching out to others. All the times I ve reached out to others when I was this low have turned out to be moments to regret. I wonder what d make me believe in that again. Why one may commit suicideSuicide is an act of intentionally causing one s own death. Samuel Ssettumba, a counsellor says suicide can be caused by the failure of one s internal coping mechanisms. There are psychological, emotional and biological events that trigger the brain to provide negative hormones, which can lead to those feelings,  he says.WHY ON SOCIAL MEDIA But why would someone take to a site which is the greatest topical melting point on the internet  A place where their plea or testament will go mostly unheard or even denigrated Ssetumba says sometimes it is gradual due to lack of social support from close relations such as friends and family. Social media is a place where people express their feelings and emotions. However, when you post these feelings on social media, people think you want attention and they will ignore you. When it is ignored, it can lead to suicide,  he says. When someone sends out unusual messages, society should pay attention. Either the people at work, family or friends. By just asking that person if they are doing well, you can change their mind from committing suicide. Ssetumba adds that many suicide victims will write or say things. He quotes Elton Jon s lyrics,  Crying at the top of my voice, but no one is listening . It is wrong to tell them to go ahead because they are already thinking so. If you do not have what to say, do not say anything. It is wrong to exacerbate their situation with our opinion,  Ssetumba says.He encourages people to always seek professional help.According to a WHO 2018 report, suicide is the second leading cause of death globally for young people aged between 15 and 19.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/When-suicide-hits-close-home/688334-5051004-o24on8z/index.html
14,Ensure you enrol for a course you won t regret - Daily Monitor,"In 2016, Makerere University students protested the institution s decision to scrap 32 courses. The affected students complained that the decision would affect their chances at gainful employment in the competitive job market. Commenting on the institution s decision, Prof John Ddumba Ssentamu, the vice chancellor of Makerere University then, said some of the courses were merged, dropped totally or restructured to give holistic training to students. He added that students must understand that curriculums are always reviewed. And while Makerere was restructuring courses, in Mukono at Uganda Christian University, some new courses were being introduced. According to Ivan Naijuka, the university spokesperson at the time, the decision to review their curriculum to include new courses was because the institution aims at giving their graduates a competitive advantage in the job market.  The need to train professionals who are whole in the sense of knowledge, integrity as well as stewardship directed the institution s decision to include new courses,  he said. But with the various changes in courses of study at our institutions, what should inform one s choice  PassionSolomon Eriatu, a former student at Kampala International University, says he had always been passionate about journalism and when it was time for him to join university, he could not look any further than a course which would offer him the much desired training. And so Eriatu enrolled for Mass Communication.  I am an extrovert and sociable person and basing on those character traits and my passion for news reporting, I decided to join journalism class. My role models are all media people and I had been practising how to write stories since primary school.  Similarly, Judith Akwelele enrolled for a Bachelors in Child Development because of her love for children.  I could not have opted for any other course as my passion for children in unrivalled. And contrary to popular belief, I had high grades that are synonymous with those who enrol for courses such as Law. At least I felt happier than my colleagues doing Law because they were influenced by their parents,  she says. InspirationOften times, students envision a conducive and favourable working environment ready to embrace them after university through the eyes of their role models. Sean Rukundo, a graduate of Procurement and Logistics, currently a CIPS student at Uganda Management Institute, says he was inspired to study procurement and logistics because of his father s success.  Having seen my father move through the ranks in a government ministry s department of procurement, I was inspired to pursue the same course. I envisioned a job market in favour of procurement officers. Unfortunately, times are dynamic and I have not been able to find a stable,  narrates Rukundo. Money factorDespite her passion for Law, 43-year-old Mary Ouma, enrolled for Bachelor of Arts in Education because she was getting government sponsorship on the latter at Makerere University.  The high tuition fees for law school left me with no option but to venture into teaching. Fortunately, I have grown to love the profession. And luckily the job market is very favourable for my kind even with the changing times,  she says. GradesAlthough some are driven by passion, others are forced to choose certain courses by their scores in national examinations. For instance Martin Kaganzi s dream of joining journalism class still remains a dream.  I was given Public Administration at Kyambogo University as my 14 points at UACE could not allow for Journalism,  he shares. Some students opt for certain courses after getting intimidated out of the ones they have been admitted to. Most universities give students a window of two weeks to if they are to switch. Akwelele reveals that some of her peers joined Child Development course because they thought it would be easier for them to pass and be free from retaking papers. Similarly Sheila Alupot, a third year student of Nkumba University switched from Mass Communication to Bachelors of Social Work and Social Administration after feeling overwhelmed.  The multiple theories and numerous fieldwork assignments in the Journalism class scared me,  she says. According to Doreen Metta, a lecturer at St Lawrence University, students need to get career guidance.  Students who receive career guidance are well equipped with the knowledge of which courses to study.  Metta encourages both teachers and parents to be involved in providing the rightful career guidance to their children so that by the time they get to university, they are sure of what they want to pursue.  Parents should be involved in exposing their children to different materials and practices that will help them make their choices. Understand your child s interest in say; medicine, and allowing them to interface with medical persons as well as be exposed to hospital environments,  she advises.WHAT THE STUDENTS SAY I enrolled for a Journalism course because I had always admired being a presenter either on television or radio but because I encountered a lot of challenges getting into that field, I got demotivated and now I just write.  Kezia Koburungi, Mass Communication student KIU We live in a world of technology and innovations.

15,"Networking, easy way of growing career - Daily Monitor","For your career to take off, you will need the help of people who will avail opportunities, know-how and connections. Just like a popular quote by American businessman and media magnate Sumner Redstone states:  If you never venture beyond what you know... You have spawned your own limitations.  To grow your professional relationships, start with the people you already know; your family and friends who will eventually introduce you to their family and friends, which will continuously expand your networking circle to a level that is satisfactory to you. Although networking might be difficult for naturally introverted people, they must make an effort to go out and meet new people because that is one way in which careers and businesses are built. TV personality, fashion designer and host of the popular Kwivuga Poetry Sessions, Nunu Umuringa Butare s career is an embodiment of the power of networking. As a social entrepreneur, her business depends on the good will of as many people as possible.  I was lucky to realise that one cannot grow or succeed in a vacuum so I set out to meet as many people as possible and make meaningful connections. I attend every event I am invited to, offer help whenever I am called upon, and treat every connection with as much respect as possible,  she says. Breaking barriersNetworks have the power to break barriers and establish the most unlikely relationships. Edwin Musiime, the NTV Property Show presenter, says he has entered the House of Lords, accessed the United States White House relying on the power of networks.  I always say that our networks determine our net worth. The power of networking has enabled me attain high levels of leverage across all spheres of influence. The Bible says iron sharpens iron; people make you a better, wiser and stronger person  Musiime reveals. Networks also help influence decision, avail mentors, life coaches and role models that are very essential for both business and career growth. As Musiime says, we are always five people away from the person we want to meet the most in the universe; someone you know might know someone who knows someone else, who knows that person you believe has the power to change your life forever.  One of my role models and personal mentor is Vusi Thembekwayo who is regarded as the world s youngest and most impressive public speaker and I met him through my vast connections. I can testify that meeting him changed my life in all ways; financially, emotionally and spiritually,  adds Musiime.Nourish relationshipsLike all relationships in life, networks need to be cultivated and nurtured or they die off. Public relations specialist Muhereza Kyamutetera avers that networks need reciprocity and integrity to flourish.  In life, we all look for relationships that benefit us either financially, emotionally or intellectually. We, therefore, seek to make connections with people that are likely to fulfill those desires. Likewise, people are drawn to us because of what they think we can do for them. So meeting these expectations is important,  Kyamutetera opines. He further recommends treating every individual relationship with the utmost importance and respect. Join an associationMost professions have an association or union that brings people together. Wilson Kutegeka, the chief executive officer of ClinicMaster, is a member of the Information and Communications Technology Association of Uganda (ICTAU).  I have benefited through connections with international organisations such as the Netherlands Trust Fund which helped develop ClinicMaster to suit international standards thus getting us clients from all over the East Africa region. This would have been a very expensive and strenuous task had I undertaken it on my own,  Kutegeka shares.

16,Learning Vs cramming: What are students taking home  - Daily Monitor,"When Prof A.B. K. Kasozi, the former National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) executive director, proposed that the current seven-year primary education be adjusted to eight, and that students transition to university after completing O-Level, scrapping off what he termed as the  unnecessary two years  of A-Level, the mixed reactions that ensued were no surprise at all. Proposals such as Prof Kasozi s, are increasingly getting more popular. Just after the release of Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE) this year for example, social media was awash with debate on relevance of such standardised examinations, with some people suggesting a total removal of PLE. However, decrying a wanting education system dates as far back as after independence from colonial rule by most African countries. African scholars set out to contribute to Africanisation of the education system and some of their suggestions were quite radical. For example, Unwuachi in 1972 favoured a complete departure from the colonial systems as cited by Dr Connie Nshemereirwe in her 2017 research paper,  What was my education for  Transformative education and the Africa we want by 2030 . Unwuachi noted that,  Black cultural objectives can never be obtained using white European standardised educational processes. Kenya s 8-4-4 system And whereas Kenya s 8-4-4 education system can be applauded for the high numbers of students in higher education compared to Uganda s (a gross enrolment ratio of 500,000 to 250,000 respectively), according to Prof Kasozi s article in the New Vision, there is one important issue it does not answer   the quality of education. As a matter of fact, over the years, Kenyans have challenged their government to overhaul the 8-4-4 system of education. In February, 2016 for example, a forum organised at Nairobi s iHub tapped into an active social media audience on Twitter and created the hashtag #CurriculumReformsKE to speak about the education of the country. Many expressed dissatisfactions with the current system, arguing that it was steeped in rote learning -basically memorising of useless facts for passing in exams, according to Tuko.co.ke.One @MartieMtange noted on Twitter that,  We need to restore the position of thinking in learning. Not just people who take in information but those who build on it.  @Linyonyism also noted,  The cost of not reforming our education system is too high. We need to start acting now. Last year, Kenya s education ministry sought to change their system and replace it with the 2-6-3-3 system. Though, led by former Moi University vice chancellor Laban Ayiro, the review discouraged the government from pushing through with the new changes. However, the report by the review team as reported in The Standard newspaper barely answers the question of quality.Whether with Kenya s 8-4-4 system or our own 7-4-2-3, there is currently a growing feeling that something is wrong with our system of education. But what is it  Are our students actually learning, beyond just enrolling into school According to Robert Bulega, a Senior Five student of Makerere College School, poor teacher renumeration and poor school facilities are the main hindrances to effective learning. He reasons,  When the teacher feels that their services are not valued, then they will not give their best, but also, learning does not take place in a vacuum. We need good facilities and equipment, which are lacking in many schools. However, Ssebweze Kyeswa, a member of Kigo Thinkers, a network of academicians, sees a more significant problem; the lack of clear national standards for all schools.  A number of schools are preoccupied with good performance in examinations than learning; lessons are mostly based on  past exams  papers. It would be premature to start worrying about the environment and teacher quality before setting the standards for the country s education system,  he writes in Dr Nshemereirwe s paper,  Creating a thinking person: The need for higher order skills in the Ugandan education system . Schooling killing learningAdditionally, Dr Lawrence Muganga, a public policy and strategy advisor, notes that our school system is wanting in many ways.  We educate children by batches and govern their lives by ringing bells. All day long, students do nothing but follow instructions. In today s world, how far can you get by simply following instructions   he wonders, adding that the modern world values people who can be creative, yet students do not get a chance to develop such skills in the current system. Dr Nshemereirwe also points to the  banking  system, which she says, is the main mode of teaching today. Here, the teacher is all knowing, and the students perceived as empty vessels.   It tells learners both the questions to be asked and the answers thereof. The banking system consequently produces individuals who gradually take on the habit of looking to others in order to find out what is what, under the belief that they have nothing of value to say,  the paper reads in part. For Muganga most of the learning that happens in schools today is not authentic because it relies on memorisation and rote learning.  We know that such learning is not authentic because most of it is gone after the exam. Learning can be much deeper and more authentic, especially when students get involved and contribute in their own learning. Limited room for talentPaulo Freire, in his book; Pedagogy of the Oppressed stresses that as human beings, our main job is to become fully human   each one of us growing into our own unique versions by discovering our passions and talents. But who in school asks or even cares about your dreams and passions  The question is always, who do you want to be like; the doctor, teacher, lawyer, among other professions. How many students will read Chemistry and Physics but when all they want to do is sing, or be with computers   Janet Namulindwa, a teacher from Lubiri Secondary School, asks. To her, this one-size-fits-all kind of education that kills intuition, initiative, passions and creativity needs to be changed.  This could be one of the reasons we have a low retention as formal education progresses because parents and students realise this is not working in terms of encouraging their passions. School dropouts join business, music, drama, vocational and technical schools in form of apprenticeship because they find these more realistic to their life s needs,  Namulindwa adds. According to her, there should therefore be room in the current education system for the most important questions in a child s life. What am I good at  What do I want to do in life  How do I fit into this world  And, then the education should be flexible enough to offer those different children the solutions.Privatisation This cutthroat, unhealthy competition we see in schools, and the encouragement of unnecessary competition amongst children other than learning from one another is slowly killing us. These private schools, with no control, charge exorbitant amounts of money to give our children first grades,  Grace, a parent at Victorious Primary School, says. She confesses that many parents live in worry about school fees and fees increments, and the long list of requirements which have made the cost of education so high. Grace, therefore, calls upon government for more control on education fees charged by private education providers. Currently, 27 per cent of schools at primary level are privately-owned and 66 per cent of schools at secondary level are private. As of 2013, enrollment in private schools was at 16.2 per cent at primary level and 51.0 per cent at secondary level according to the Privatisation, Discrimination and the Right to Education in Uganda Alternative Report of June 2015.High stake examinations While examining how schooling is killing learning, it came out strongly that the major cause of rote learning isthe high-stake examinations.  It is like life begins and ends with those examinations, and if you do not pass, you are doomed, which is not right,  a parent argued. The recent education report, Facing forward: Schooling for learning in Africa 2018) by the World Bank, noted that,  High-stake examinations are a bottleneck to progression. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa continue to have high-stake selection examinations that filter children for the next level of education. This creates perverse incentives for teachers to  teach to the test  and leads to unnecessary grade repetition,  the report reads in part. However, countries that have eliminated examinations between the primary and lower secondary levels have shown significant increase in lower secondary enrolments and improvements in basic education completion, the report noted.Financing Very often, the issue of financing our education, has come up. According to the Education and Sports Sector Annual Performance Report Financial Year 2016/17 Subsector Allocation, primary education takes the lion s share of the budget with a 50.17 per cent allocation, followed by tertiary with 19.61 per cent allocation. Secondary education with a 15.20 per cent, business, technical and vocational education and training at 10.55 per cent and others such as physical education, sports with 4.47 per cent of the total Shs2,447.88 billion budget.  So, does it come as a surprise that we have high numbers of pupils enrolling for primary education and yet the numbers dwindle in lower secondary, sharply falling at higher secondary and university   Mathias Mugumya, an education enthusiast, asks. To Dr Muganga, we not only need to fix a few things in the education sector but rather a fundamental change that includes the issues raised earlier.  If we want to prepare our children for the modern world and want learning to be effective, then we need to fundamentally change our system of education,  he says.Performance at different levelsThe education system has also been in the spotlight for student s dwindling performance. In the Education and Sports Sector Annual Performance Report financial year 2016/17 for example, Literacy rate at Primary Three was at 60.2 per cent and 51.9 per cent at Primary Six. Numeracy rate at Primary Three was 71.7 per cent and 52.6 per cent at Primary Six. Primary Leaving Examinations pass rate was at 86 per cent in 2015/16 and 86.9 per cent in 2016/17. The pass rate at O-Level was at 87 per cent whereas the Performance Index was at 39 per cent. Performance Index at Advanced Level was 64 per cent. Editor's thoughts Many educationists think there is something wrong with our education system. In fact as you will find out in the cover article, different people, students inclusive, feel that our education system needs an overhaul. Some argue that this should start with improving teachers  salaries yet others say, there Education ministry needs to set standards of operation and follow them up. But in trying to do all this, we must remember that learning goes beyond the classroom. This will help us to stop promoting more of exams than we do actual learning.How many schools for instance encourage students to come up with educational projects  In most Ugandan schools today, there is little or nothing at all being done to encourage innovation. All that students are encouraged to do is read notes and pass examinations. In doing this, schools are churning out students that seem geniuses but cannot think outside the box. Such students, as the future will tell, may not be able to solve simple life challenges when they face them. Therefore, to promote holistic learning, our schools should encourage innovation and creative thinking than cramming.Peninah Asiimwe[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Learning-cramming-What-are-students-taking-home-education/688336-5050716-uco0huz/index.html

18,Opposition camp: Rest Vs Besigye - Daily Monitor,"Kampala- The run up to the 2021 General Election has arrived early, and the first barbs have been thrown; battle lines drawn. The Opposition group that has drawn first blood went for the less likely, albeit usual target, Dr Kizza Besigye. At Hotel Africana in Kampala on Thursday, the occasion was for what has been dubbed the  DP Bloc  to sign a pact that binds them. DP Bloc is made up of DP, the principal party; three-time presidential candidate Abed Bwanika s People s Development Party (PDP); former Makindye East MP Michael Mabikke s Social Democratic Party (SDP); and a group led by former presidential candidate Samuel Lubega. DP president-general Norbert Mao largely played the role of facilitator at the function where several speakers threw jibes at Dr Besigye, who on the same day, was in Kabale District on his mobilisation drive.Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, aka Bobi Wine, who has in the past referred to Dr Besigye as his mentor, delivered his fiercest sting to-date against the four-time presidential candidate. For close to a year, supporters of Mr Kyagulanyi and Dr Besigye have fought what was sometimes a vicious war, mainly on social media, but the two men remained largely civil towards each other except on a few occasions when the daggers seemed to be drawn. The first incident was during the last day of campaigns for the Arua Municipality by-election in August last year in which the two men supported different candidates. Mr Kyagulanyi was in a procession with eventual winner Kassiano Wadri when their crowd came face-to-face with the rally of Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) candidate Bruce Musema, which Dr Besigye was addressing. Mr Kyagulanyi, standing atop his vehicle amid blaring music, signaled the people Dr Besigye was addressing to join his group. Dr Besigye urged his crowd to ignore the other crowd and paused, until Mr Kyagulanyi strolled away and the rally continued. Mr Kyagulany s group would later get into an altercation with presidential guards, which resulted in the shooting to death of his driver, Yasin Kawuma. Presidential security claimed that people in Mr Kyagulanyi s crowd stopped one of the cars in the presidential motorcade as the President made his way to the airstrip after addressing the rally of his party s candidate in the race, Ms Nusura Tiperu. Mr Kyagulanyi, Mr Wadri and more than 30 others were arrested and charged with treason over the issue. Then on Boxing Day last year, the police blocked Mr Kyagulanyi from staging a musical concert at his beach in Busabala, Wakiso District. In the heat of the moment, Mr Kyagulanyi bemoaned the persecution that he said the government had put him through, pointing out that some Opposition players run petrol stations and they have never been closed.The comment was interpreted as meant for Dr Besigye, who operates a petrol station in Nsambya, Kampala. Mr Kyagulanyi, however, also operates small petrol stations in Gomba and Butambala districts, in addition to a recording studio and other businesses, which too had not been shut down.This prompted a response from Dr Besigye s supporters, who pointed out that when their man started opposing President Museveni and fled to exile, his brother, Joseph Musasizi, who was running his petrol station and other businesses, was arrested and charged with treason and murder. He stayed locked up for years and, Dr Besigye says, Musasizi s leukemia got out of hand because it could not be managed in prison. He died shortly after being released.Fresh attacksDespite those incidences, Dr Besigye and Mr Kyagulanyi had largely stayed civil towards each other in the public space until the Africana meeting when Mr Kyagulanyi pulled off the gloves. He said he had  concluded that some members in the Opposition are only concerned about their positions and will fight any composition that threatens their positions . Mr Kyagulanyi added:  Don t talk about democracy and stand four times and on the fifth time you tell people democracy doesn t work. We believe it works. On that point, I will assert that democracy actually works and anybody who despises democracy is despising the people of Uganda. Mr Kyagulanyi s comments were in reference to prior statements by Dr Besigye, who has on various occasions said President Museveni will not easily leave power even if he is defeated at the polls, like he claims he defeated him in 2016 and earlier. Moments after Mr Kyagulanyi made the comments critical of Dr Besigye, Mr Daniel Muwonge, who backs Dr Besigye, posted on Facebook:  Two years ago, in Kyadondo (East) by-elections, Besigye s picture was used as symbol of unity and strength, by the same man who has today called Besigye all sorts of names. Struggle continues.  Mr Muwonge posted a picture of Mr Kyagulanyi s campaign poster, with the picture of the youthful legislator sandwiched by that of Dr Besigye to the right and Kampala Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago to the left.Enter BwanikaBefore Mr Kyagulanyi spoke, Dr Bwanika had his go at Dr Besigye. Dr Bwanika said:  I have heard one person who has now perpetually become a presidential candidate and wants to become one again. I have decided, whether I will remain alone, I will ensure that Ugandans don t vote that presidential candidate again. I will work on it. It is my mandate because I am aware he is not among those who are coming; he is among those who are going. Therefore, we will not give him space again. In all the three times (2006, 2011 and 2016), Dr Bwanika has run as a presidential candidate, he has contested with Dr Besigye. Dr Besigye has on all occasions been the main challenger against Mr Museveni and Dr Bwanika an also-run. But bad blood has always flowed against the two men, with Dr Bwanika ever on the offensive, while Dr Besigye s backers accuse him of working for President Museveni from within the Opposition. After the 2006 election, another bitterly contested election, Dr Besigye went to court to challenge Mr Museveni s victory. Dr Bwanika, who was a candidate in the same election, swore an affidavit in support of Mr Museveni s victory.   I read and heard from the media that one of the candidates had since petitioned court challenging the outcome of the election and as a Born-Again Christian and peace-loving Ugandan, who is interested in the rule of law and democracy, I deem it my duty to come forward and state what I know to be true about the election,  Dr Bwanika s affidavit reads in part. The candidate Dr Bwanika referred to was Dr Besigye. Since then, Dr Besigye s backers accuse him of being a fifth columnist within the Opposition ranks. In the last election, Dr Besigye kept receiving money from his supporters across the country. During a rally in Luweero, Dr Bwanika took on the voters, asking them why they don t give their fellow Muganda (Bwanika) money and support yet they gave it to Dr Besigye (who is not a Muganda). He repeated the charges in a few other places. Dr Besigye and his team have also pointed at comments Dr Bwanika makes on a talk show on Buganda Kingdom-owned radio, Central Broadcasting Service (CBS) fm and accused him of promoting tribalism within the Opposition ranks. In December last year, Dr Besigye said a catchphrase Mr Kyagulanyi introduced   Mwebereremu (fight for yourselves)   had tribal intonations. This was interpreted as an attack on Mr Kyagulanyi. Dr Besigye quickly issued an apology for the  misunderstanding , and later explained that his reference was to the way Dr Bwanika uses the word to address Baganda on CBS radio.Mao, Mabikke and Muntu On his part, Mr Mao, who ran for president in 2011 and came a distant third as Dr Besigye was again the closest to President Museveni, did not deploy his oratory skills at great length but ensured his message was concisely delivered. Mr Mao said to Mr Kyagulanyi:  We are very happy that you have jumped into the pool and you are causing displacement, which is not a bad thing, after all when our leaders become misleaders and our mentors become tormentors and freedom of expression becomes a target of oppression, then opposition becomes our position.  Mr Mao was partly referencing lyrics of one Mr Kyagulanyi s hit songs. Mr Kyagulanyi has previously referred to Dr Besigye his mentor. Another co-principal in the DP bloc, Mr Mabikke, also had a message of his own.  For too long, the centre stage in the Opposition has been dominated by mediocre leadership. They are not up to the task; they are no match to the challenge we confront; they have got no ideas; and they have no plans but just want to stick at the helm,  Mr Mabikke said.Former FDC president, Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu, was also in attendance, invited as a guest, just like Mr Kyagulanyi and Jeema president Asuman Basalirwa. Gen Muntu and Mr Basalirwa did not aim barbs at Dr Besigye or any other Opposition player.Besigye activities At the end of 2018, Dr Besigye declared 2019  the year of action , vowing to intensify mobilisation against President Museveni, with the objective of forcing him out of power before the 2021 election. Dr Besigye insists that he won the 2016 election and that Mr Museveni is in office illegally.To break the impasse that followed the 2016 election, different groups tried to broker talks between Mr Museveni and Dr Besigye, and Dr Besigye put carrying out an audit of the 2016 election as one of the conditions. Papers were drafted for the two principals to sign and at different points, the mediators were cautiously optimistic that talks could happen, but the process eventually collapsed. President Museveni got on a programme of his own and efforts to remove the age limit for presidential candidates gained currency on the one hand, while on the other hand Dr Besigye went underground building structures to further his politics. In February, Dr Besigye launched what he calls the People s Assembly, the equivalent of a parliament for his People s Government, which he established when he declared himself winner of the 2016 election and a video of him being  sworn-in  as president surfaced on social media on the eve of President Museveni s swearing-in on May 12, 2016. After launching the People s Assembly at a national level, Dr Besigye and his allies have proceeded to launch regional assemblies simultaneously in the different regions of the country, and say they have a plan to launch assemblies further down to districts, sub-counties and villages. The assemblies being launched are composed of people mobilised through covert activities over two years. In all these activities, Dr Besigye enjoys the backing of the FDC-led by Mr Patrick Amuriat, who had one of his key promises during the campaign for the party s leadership  to reclaim our (2016) victory . Dr Besigye also enjoys the backing of non-FDC members like Mr Lukwago, who is the vice president of the People s Government, and Mukono Municipality MP Betty Nambooze, who is the spokesperson of the People s Government. To become FDC president, Mr Amuriat defeated Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu in a fallout that eventually saw Gen Muntu quit the party and is in the process of forming another party, the Alliance for National Transformation (ANT). Gen Muntu also attended the DP Bloc signing ceremony on Thursday and was later that evening the guest on NTV s  On the Spot  programme. On all occasions, he steered clear of attacking Dr Besigye or any Opposition player.On Thursday, Dr Besigye clashed with the police, but eventually held processions through the town and addressed his supporters in the council hall of Hamurwa Town Council, Rubanda District. This was after the police blocked him from addressing rallies that had been planned to happen at Hamurwa and Bubare playgrounds.Explaining the decision to block the outdoor rallies, Mr Ramathan Tai, the Rubanda District police commander, said:  The permission that was granted to them was to hold an indoor meeting, but not a public rally. That is why we never allowed them to hold one. Making of the DP bloc The DP Bloc started with the grand union in which former members and those affiliated to the party, were supposed to return to the Norbert Mao-led group. On May 23, 2018, the party held a grand union at Makerere University and invited local and international guests. While the international guests on the invitation list, such as Dr Klaus Schuller, the managing director of Germany s Christian Democratic Union, opposition leaders Raila Odinga (Kenya) , Mr Nelson Chamisa (Zimbabwe), former Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar, Mr Fikile Mbalula from South Africa and Dr Paul Williams from UK, made no show despite the party confirming their presence, several local politicians attended. These included former Leader of the Opposition in Parliament Winnie Kizza, former FDC president, Maj Gen (Rtd) Mugisha Muntu, Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi, Jeema president Asumani Basalirwa and PDP president Abedi Bwanika.More reunion fetes were lined up, but so far, less than a handful have happened, including one in Masaka and Mukono. The Masaka event was characterised by violence from supporters allied to warring members, forcing Mr Mao to suspend the events, citing hooliganism.In February, police blocked the reunion event organised in Jinja Town. The party had since gone silent on the activity until the April 4, MoU signing ceremony.

19,"Mambule, where  old cars get new life - Daily Monitor","Different makes, brands and models are piled on top of one another in different stages of their death. Hovering around are scrap dealers waiting to grab the skeleton leftovers. Welcome to Mambule car graveyard in Bwaise, Kawempe Division, Kampala. Car wreckages are collected from all over the country and deposited here for their last days as they are ripped apart one piece after the other until the final remains are taken to a steel milling factory for their epitaph. It is from here that a car is dismantles and its parts are scattered in the East African region and beyond. Traders come from as far as DRC, Kenya, Tanzania, and Southern Sudan looking for spare parts. How it startedWhat started more than 40 years ago as a sole proprietorship has given birth to a whole industry, creating hundreds of direct jobs and thousands more indirectly. Having started from a small piece of land less than a 10x10ft on the defunct Mambule Road, the graveyard now covers several acres. It has now grown into an association of traders; Mambule Road Spare Parts Trader s Association. According to the association s defence secretary, Salongo Kadali, as the number of traders and cars increased, there was need to form an association to unite them in the business.  This business was started by the late Mohammed Mugalu more than 40 years ago. He started by buying accident car wreckages and other government cars sold under auction once they were written off the road.  With Mugalu s death, the business suffered for some time before Fred Luboyera, also deceased, revived it.  When Luboyera came in, he was buying cars, some of them in working condition and resold them as spare parts,  Kadali says. It was during Luboyera s time that the trade attracted more people and it grew into what it is today. There is a silver lining in every dark cloud. When Kiseka Market in downtown Kampala closed for redevelopment, it was a windfall for spare parts traders and landlords on Mambule Road.  A sizeable number of Kiseka Market traders moved here and as a result, rent prices increased,  Kadali says. Even before the ongoing developments, Mambule Road was a supplier of spare parts to Kiseka Market.  Old car parts were collected from here by Kiseka Market traders, who would clean them up and present them as either new or reconditioned from Japan or Dubai, United Arab Emirates,  Kadali reveals.Sources of the carsIt is difficult to know the exact number of vehicles received at Mambule car graveyard per month because the leaders do not document it. But one thing the management of the graveyard is sure about is that the bulk of them have real value for money.  About 70 per cent of the cars we receive here are accident wreckages. As police statistics indicate, most of the accidents are due to reckless driving. Old cars are hardly driven recklessly as compared to cars in sound condition, which are driven recklessly and thus the accidents. As a result, their spares parts are always in good working condition, save for the damaged parts, which are mostly external,  Kadali says.Since majority of the cars are accident wreckages, police comes into the picture. But the police don t come to them looking for market, although it is the main source of such cars. There are brokers who monitor such cars at different police stations and even follow them through the court processes. We get most of these cars from police stations all over the country. We pay for them through the courts, and present the receipts at the concerned police station before we tow the car here,  Isma Makumbi, the chairman of the association, says.However, not all cars are accident wreckages. Some cars are got directly from the owners  homes.  There are some cars we get from people s homes after they had been grounded for some time, while others are got from government parking yards after they are auctioned to us,  Kadali says.Unlike other car buyers, the spare parts dealers at Mambule car graveyard value the cars they buy based on the resalable parts left of them. As a result, it is not possible to fix a particular price.  When buying these cars, we value them from the smallest part of the car that we can sell off it. It is possible to buy a Toyota Harrier at Shs4m and buy a Toyota Probox at Shs7m. This is in such cases where the Harrier may be more damaged than the Probox.  There are also incidences where owners approach them with offers to sell to them their car wreckages. In such cases, Makumbi says they have ground rules to follow before a purchase is made.  In such cases, the seller must produce the original logbook in their name and the number plate. Where the logbook is not in the seller s name, he or she must present an original sale agreement with the person whose name appear in the logbook, without which we don t buy the car,  Kadali explains.A walk through the yard reveals that some car wreckages still have number plates, while others don t.  When buying an accident car wreckage, police retain the number plates, while the ones bought from individuals are brought with their number plates and after the car has been ripped and sold, the number plates are returned to police,  Makumbi explains.Some car models brought to the graveyard are too old and considered outdated. However, Kadali says some car models considered outdated in Uganda have their spare parts much sought after by trades from Kenya and Tanzania.  For instance, Kadali explains:  Once upon a time, the Toyota 1200 pick-up truck was the in thing, especially for town errands. However, with the introduction of K-trucks which are more fuel efficient and carry more goods, the pick-up 1200 was pushed off the road. The same happened to the Sahara pick-ups. They were pushed off the market by the Town Ace for the same reason as the pickups 1200. ChallengesChaos of car ownership. Just like any other business dealing in old and wrecked vehicles, Mambule car graveyard has also got its own challenges. According to Kadali, despite the strict ground rules to be followed before they buy a car from somebody, they still get incidences such as buying stolen cars.He cites an incident where a woman allegedly sold a car to them, only for the husband to turn up with police looking for the same car, now reported as stolen. It turned out that the woman sold the car without the man s consent.  In most cases, such incidences go to court and the case drags on for long. As businessmen, sometimes we fail to appear in court all the time and we end up losing our money just like that,  Kadali says.Besides cases like the aforementioned, the managers have also had to deal with cases where two people claim ownership of the same car and each has a  genuine  logbook. In some cases, they have had stolen cars with changed number plates. Makumbi says in such cases, they strike a win-win deal with the authorities.  Once a car is proved to have been stolen, we work with the authorities to ensure that neither of the parties loses. The car is returned to the owner and police helps us recover our money,  he says.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Mambule-old-cars-Kawempe--Spare-Parts-DRC/688334-5058948-g7ilwyz/index.html
20,Passport shortage hits labour export agencies - Daily Monitor,"Kampala- Ugandans seeking passports to travel abroad may have to wait for some time as the country has run short of material to print the official travel document.The most affected are youth seeking jobs abroad through the different labour export agencies that for the last one week have not been able to receive passports for their clients. The issue of passports not being available has disorganised [us] too much because we had clients who were set to [travel]this week knowing that their passports were supposed to be out already,  a director of one of the external labour recruiting company told Daily Monitor yesterday.The Ministry of Internal Affairs spokesperson, Mr Jacob Siminyu, said:  I am still in a meeting. The only thing you can do is to send me an e-mail with questions, I will then provide the answers.  By the time of filing this story, he had not yet responded to our e-mail.The State Minister for Internal Affairs, Mr Obiga Kania, referred us to the Directorate of Citizenship and Immigration Control, saying:  I have not yet been briefed about passport shortage. This newspaper learnt from a source within the department that they will be ready to print passports by the start of next week. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak on behalf of the department, said only those passports for emergency travels such as sick people referred for urgent medical attention abroad can be printed at the moment.The external labour recruitment agencies that we spoke to said they have hundreds of clients stranded because of the passports. Some of our clients have contracts signed and flights booked. It is going to be expensive to cancel and re-book the flights,  said a director of a company that exports domestic workers to the Middle East.When this reporter visited the ministry premises yesterday, business was going on normally but the officials were mostly serving those applying for new passports, renewals and those with queries.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Passport-shortage-Siminyu-labour-export-agencies-Kania/688334-5059004-15pvihez/index.html
21,Court orders university to reinstate People Power candidate in guild race - Daily Monitor,"The Gulu High Court has ordered Gulu University to reinstate Mr Imuran Ntambazi to contest for the position of Guild President at the institution.Mr Ntambazi, was among four other students at the university who last month expressed interest to run for the leadership of the students  body.The Second year Bachelors of Computer Science student, was, however, blocked from being nominated for the race on March 23, by the Dean of Students on allegations that he was not a fully registered student at the university.It was also alleged that Mr Ntambazi s nomination was blocked because he identified himself with the People Power Movement, a rising political group associated with the Kyadondo East Member of Parliament, Mr Robert Kyagulanyi alias Bobi Wine.Through his lawyer, Mr  Lastone Gulume, Mr Ntambazi sued Gulu University for unfairly blocking him arguing that the action would ruin  his political ambitions.Mr Ntambazi also applied to court to suspend the elections which were scheduled to take place on April 7.The Gulu High Court Deputy Registrar, Mr Rose Mary Bareebe had on Wednesday asked the two parties [Mr Ntambazi and Gulu University] to settle the matter out of court arguing that the ruling might not favour any of them.However, in a Thursday ruling, Ms Bareebe ordered Gulu University to reinstate Mr Ntambazi to participate and contest for the guild presidency.She ordered that with the exception of the requisite fees, Mr Ntambazi should undertake and fulfil all the other requisites for his nomination and eventual participation in the Guild elections as outlined by the Guild Electoral Commission.Ms Bareebe also ordered the applicant not to affiliate with any political party or partisan body which negatively portrays the image of Gulu University. Prior to and during the nomination processes, the applicant shall neither affiliate to any political party nor any partisan body which shall negatively portray the image of the University and neither shall the applicant associate with or promote rowdy movements at the University. Contravention of the above may lead to the cancellation of his participation in the electoral process,  Ms Bareebe ruled.Mr Gulume, however, said from his the interpretation of the court ruling, his client is only bared from participating in partisan politics before nomination arguing that after his successful nomination, he is free to join any political group. The order limits association to the stage of prior to and during the nomination process. This in my view doesn t extend to the campaigning stage which is a post nomination process leading to the elections,  Mr Gulume said.He said that his client will have to get recommendations from the University academic registrar and the Dean of Students before being nominated.Others in the race are Mr Alexander Okidi, a second-year student of Development Studies, Mr Samuel Oyet Agwani, a second- year student of  Arts in Education, Mr Johnson Nowe, a third year Medicine & Surgery student and Mr Moses Etyak, a second- year student of Computer Science.Court also ordered both parties to meet their own costs and extended the guild elections to April 13 to enable Mr Ntambazi to participate.

22,"Mother, son killed in Luweero house fire - Daily Monitor","LUWEERO. Police in Luweero District have retrieved remains of a mother and her son from a house that was last night gutted by fire at Sekanusu Zone in Wobulenzi Town Council.Police identified the deceased as Gladys Nabatanzi, 34, and Fahad Nsereko, 12, who were burnt beyond recognition. Nabatanzi's other two children Naisha Nabagereka, 3 and Malahad Musiito, 5 have been admitted at Kiruddu Hospital and Njovu Health Centre respectively.The Savana regional Police Spokesperson Paul Kangave confirmed the incident saying the fire was caused by the short circuit. The fire reportedly started at 1.30am and our firefighting team from Luweero Central Police Station responded in time and managed to put out the fire by 2:30am. Preliminary investigations indicate that the fire was caused by the electric short circuit,  Kangave said.Ms Vivian Nalweyiso, a neighbour said she had an alarm of people crying for help but they were unable to rescue the deceased. I opened my house when I heard noise coming from other neighbours and we managed to rescue the two children who are now in hospital,  she said.The Wobulenzi Town Council LCIII Chairperson Mr Moses Ssebalamu said the vigilance of the area residents saved the lives of two children although the life of the mother and her 12-year-old son could not be saved.  The fire started at a time when many people are deep in sleep. It is very difficult to call for help when you are in house engulfed with fire because of possible suffocation. I want to thank the police and residents for their quick response which saved lives of two children,  Ssebalamu said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Mother-son-killed-Luweero-house-fire/688334-5058394-fooiy/index.html
23,Government starts cattle restocking drive - Daily Monitor,"PALLISA. The government through the Office of the Prime Minister has handed over more than 370 head of cattle to Pallisa District to be distributed to different families under the restocking programme.The district production officer, Dr Richard Boddo Okot, told Daily Monitor on Tuesday that livestock will be distributed to the selected beneficiaries in 14 sub-counties in the district. The beneficiaries will include widows, people with disabilities, the elderly and those living with HIV/Aids,  he said, adding that they targeted the most vulnerable groups to benefit from the programme.Communities to benefit The beneficiary sub-counties include Apopong, which will get 48 heifers, Kasodo 40, Kamuge 32, Puti-Puti 40, and Agule 32. Other sub-counties include Akisim, 32, Kameke 32, Olok 32, Pallisa 24, Kibale 32 and Opwateta 32, among others.  The restocking programme is aimed at empowering communities, which were affected by the Karimajong cattle rustlers in Teso Sub-region and some neighbours in the early 1980s. Mr John Micheal Okurut, the Pallisa LC5 chairman, said they will ensure that heifers are distributed to the rightful beneficiaries. We will not entertain any ghost beneficiaries like what happens with most government projects,  he said. Mr Okurut said the beneficiaries have been warned against selling the cows in order to buy alcohol. Mr Jacob Opolot, the Pallisa County Member of Parliament, commended the government for selecting Pallisa among the districts to benefit from the programme. Mr Opolot said:  For those who haven t received should remain calm because there is second disbursement. They shouldn t lose hope and begin blaming government of being discriminative.  Ms Petwa Naula, a resident, hailed government for the intervention and said it will enable them to improve on their livelihood.  We welcome the intervention. We have been waiting for so long,  she said. BackgroundCattle raids. When the NRM disbanded the Teso militias established by the Uganda Peoples Congress government in the early 1980 s to provide defence against the neighbouring Karimojong cattle wrestlers, it left the people vulnerable.Since the NRA was lean and over stretched in their operational areas in Acholi sub-region, it could not provide sufficient protection to the locals. The Karimojong cattle rustlers exploited that loophole and raided Teso and neighbours to depletion.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-starts-cattle-restocking-drive/688334-5057442-13lpm4w/index.html
24,Authorities take children off streets to curb crime - Daily Monitor,"Authorities in Bugiri Municipality, Bugiri District, have started taking children off the streets and encouraging them to return to school as a measure to curb crime in the area.The programme, which targets both young and adult street people, mainly those who dropped out of school and want to continue with their studies, will be extended to Iganga, Namutumba and districts in Busoga Sub-region.The Bugiri Municipality MP, Mr Asuman Basalirwa, on Wednesday said:  I have witnessed incidents where street children snatch gadgets and other items from traders especially women. Government has totally failed to come up with policies and measures of discharging these children from streets. ChallengesMr Basalirwa fears that since the programme is being spearheaded by concerned citizens and some Opposition figures, government is likely to back off. This time round, we are appealing to our colleagues in the ruling government to support us and not back off as we plan for the future generation. Under this programme, we are imparting skills into these children and encouraging them to be responsible citizens, not beggars,   he said.Mr Joshua Baxstone, a Bugiri-based gospel artiste, said he noticed an increase in the number of street children and joined hands with other artistes to encourage them to return to school but authorities thought they were instead fighting government.The Bugiri Municipality Mayor, Mr Bumali Luba, said parents will be required to buy scholastic materials for their children and feeding them while at school during the programme. We have noticed that a number of these children are orphans while others have parents who have abdicated from their responsibilities; so as we encourage these kids to return to school, we also want parents to take part,   he said.The Naluwerere Village vice chairperson, Mr Wilson Mokova, vowed to support the programme, saying many children are dropping out of school.Waiswa Makika, 14, who has lived on the street for four years, said he was sent to the streets by his grandmother to beg for money after his mother passed on. I dropped out in Primary Three because my grandmother lacked money, but if I get another chance, I will do my best because I want to become a doctor. Right now I take care of my 82- year-old blind grandmother,   he said.Nabirye Nampina, 10, said she came to the street after being told that people give money to young children.[email protected] ",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Authorities-take-children-off-streets-curb-crime/688334-5057456-n2esp1/index.html
25,Government using colonial tactics to stay in power - Besigye - Daily Monitor,"Four-time presidential candidate Kizza Besigye has said the government is using colonial tactics to stop Opposition leaders from mobilising their supporters ahead of 2021 elections.Dr Besigye said despite the threats, vanguards of change will not relent. The struggle has just begun; police and the government are using tactics of the British, who colonialised us, to threaten people with guns but we are not giving up the struggle. We are moving all over the country to empower Ugandans to stand against the oppressors,  he said in Bushenyi on Wednesday.This was after Dr Besigye was blocked by police from addressing FDC party supporters at Kizinda playground in Bushenyi-Ishaka Municipality. Police used tear gas to disperse his supporters. What you are seeing now is a sign that Mr Museveni fears the power of the people. That is why he does not want us to talk to them so that they can get empowered. Once the people are empowered, they will not fear Mr Museveni s colonial tactics and he will eventually leave power to Ugandans,  he said.The FDC party president, Mr Patrick Amuriat, said they are not surprised by police actions because their mobilisation activities have always been disrupted and supporters dispersed. We are on countrywide mobilisation; we are conducting indoor meetings with our leaders per region and after, we address the public. Out of respect, we inform police of our activities and we know that according to the law, we do not need to seek for permission and they are not supposed block us from addressing our supporters,   Mr Amuriat said.From greater Bushenyi, the team moved to Kigezi sub-region yesterday and today, they are expected to be in greater Mbarara before heading to Buganda sub-region.  Earlier we had organised to go to Mubende but we were surrounded and could not meet the people. We then went Kaliro our supporters were beaten and harassed. We condemn acts of harassing people and teargasing people by police because this is not expected of a Force that is supposed to keep law and order,  Mr Amuriat said.However, the police spokesperson for Greater Bushenyi region, Mr Martial Tumusiime, said FDC did not seek permission to address the rally.  Dr Besigye came to Bushenyi on Wednesday and he was allowed to go to BFM radio station. Thereafter, he went to a hotel where he met his people and we did not have a problem with that. But he was stopped from addressing a rally in Kizinda because they had not asked for permission and that is when there was a bit of teargas,   Mr Tumusiime said.He added that police are acting professionally and we will remain doing so.

26,Government worried over low response to cervical cancer immunisation - Daily Monitor,"KAKUMIRO. The government of Uganda risks losing the fight against cervical cancer over low response to the countrywide immunisation exercise, an official has said.Cervical cancer is caused by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which is sexually-transmitted.According to a 2016 report from the National Information Centre on HPV and cancer, Uganda s cervical cancer prevalence rate stands at 33.6 per cent.Mr Robert Kahaibare, the coordinator of the HPV immunisation programme in the Ministry of Health, said government rolled out a two-phase vaccination campaign in October 2015, targeting girls aged 10 years.However, he said the target population has shunned the exercise. It has been discovered that 20 per cent of women with cancer are found to be suffering from that of the cervix. The young girls are not completing immunisation doses and this does not give them total protection against the virus,  said Mr Kahaibare. The immunisation is carried out in two phases where the first dose is given on the first contact and the second is administered after six months. We have, however, found out that girls are not completing the dose,  he added.Low response in KakumiroMr Kahaibare, who was on a sensitisation drive in Kakumiro on Tuesday, said the district is performing poorly in terms of responding to the campaign.He explained that in 2016, 27 per cent of girls in the district got the first HPV1 dose and another 3 per cent got the second dose (HPV2). He added that in 2017, only 16.5 per cent of women in the district got the first dose and only 20.5 per cent the second one.Last year, Mr Kahaibare said 52.6 per cent got the first dose and 23.9 per cent got the last dose. We have found out that Kakumiro has been performing poorly in this immunisation exercise. That is why we came for this meeting. May be it could be poor information flow or because the community has a misconception about the immunization campaign,  he added.Mr Kahaibare said the government is now engaging all stakeholders, especially health workers and school administrators, to step up the immunisation campaign. We also want those ones out of the school to get immunised. That is why we have brought local leaders. Each head teacher is supposed to register all those children aged 10, inform the nearby health centre and make sure that they are all immunised,  he said.The in-charge of Kakumiro Health Centre IV, Ms Mary Assumputa, said the findings from the ministry have put them in the worst position. The country s response to immunisation against HPV stands at 41 percent. I want to urge all people to embrace cancer screening on a regular basis because about 99 per cent of people get to know that they have cancer infections after developing symptoms,  Ms Assumputa said.Mr Jackson Kabagyire, a resident of Mukarere Village in Kisengwe Sub-county, who has three girls aged between nine and 13 years, said they have never been immunised because of inaccessibility to the services.The Chief Administrative Officer, Mr Stephen Monday, said the only solution lies is stepping up efforts in the immunisation campaign. We will embrace the immunisation programme and we will at least be going to schools to immunise the girls,  Mr Monday said.The District Health Officer, Dr Robert Senteza, admitted that people with children in the targeted age bracket are yet to appreciate the HPV immunisation campaign. But with concerted sensitisation efforts, we are optimistic the people will embrace the service for better protection and enhanced general public health,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-worried-low-response-cervical-cancer-immunisation/688334-5057488-yewu4i/index.html
27,Prisoners impress government with life skills project - Daily Monitor,"The government has drawn lessons from a successful prisoners  project and has committed to meet the cost of replicating it in other parts of the country, an official has said.Mr Adams Hasiyo, the principal social rehabilitation and welfare officer with Uganda Prisons Service (UPS), said yesterday that the government plans to  gazette  the inmates  entrepreneurship and life skills training as an integral part of social rehabilitation and reintegration.During the project implementation, youth prisoners were trained in entrepreneurship and life skills. The beneficiaries were also equipped with communication skills, identification of business opportunities, marketing, customer service and care, book keeping and developing business plans.Lango and Acholi sub-regions have implemented economic empowerment and social reintegration of youth ex-prisoners  (SREE) project for the last three years. The project has been supported by Advance Afrika, a non-profit governmental organisation, in partnership with UPS with funding from European Union and Caritas Switzerland.The three-year action plan focused on social economic rehabilitation and reintegration of 1,200 youth prisoners in 28 prison units in Acholi and Lango sub-regions.The courses that lasted three months had inmates receive kits to enable them establish businesses. Mr Hasiyo last week said:  Political will for continuation of SREE programme activities is guaranteed. Our partners did a commendable job by engaging different political stakeholders to understand, appreciate and embrace the programme.  He further said the government has devised strategies of granting continuity of activities previously handled and facilitated by their partner organisations in northern Uganda.Mr David Opio, the officer-in-charge of Loro prison farm in Oyam District, said the rehabilitation project is yielding fruits.

28,Man dies in alcohol drinking contest - Daily Monitor,"A 22-year-old man died after taking part in a drinking competition at a bar in Aromo Sub-county in Lira District. Mr Peter Olobo, a resident of Arwot-olaro Village in Otara Parish, reportedly collapsed and died shortly after consuming six glasses of alcohol in less than three minutes during the alcohol competition on Tuesday. Two other young men who also took part in the competition became unconscious and were rushed to a nearby clinic for treatment. They, however, recovered hours later. The Aromo Sub-county chairperson, Mr David Elich, confirmed the incident. He said some of the residents who spoke to Daily Monitor blamed Olobo s death on the biting youth unemployment in the country.He said Olobo went to Diana Pub, a local bar in the area where he found his colleagues, John Ojok Oryema and Bonny Ocen Erong. They then put a bet of Shs5,000 each totaling to Shs15,000 which would be won by whoever managed to drink 10 glasses of alcohol within 10 minutes.  Olobo managed to drink six glasses before he fell on the ground and died while his colleagues also became unconscious and they were rushed to nearby clinic. They recovered hours later,  Mr Elich told Daily Monitor on Wednesday.Similar incidentThis is the second time a similar incident has taken place.  Last year, we lost a boy called Alex Okiba who entered into a drinking competition and died. The contest involved drinking 12 sachets of chief waragi,  Mr Elich said. The incident happened in Acan-to-ipur Village in the same parish of Otara where high drinking rate among the youth is common.The LC3 chairperson said the sub-county security committee which he chairs has restricted drinking hours from 3pm to 5pm.   Anybody found drinking outside that hour will be arrested.  The officer-in-charge of Aromo Police Station, Mr Hudson Otee, said they have organised an operation that will mainly target unproductive youth.  We shall carry out an operation to arrest anybody found drinking at a time when they are supposed to do productive work. They will be charged with being rogue and vagabond,  he said.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Man-dies-alcohol-drinking-contest/688334-5056600-8vagxcz/index.html
29,Justice Bamugemereire visits Daily Monitor offices - Daily Monitor,"Kampala. The Commission of Inquiry into land matters last evening made a courtesy visit to Daily Monitor offices on 8th Street in Kampala and commended the newspaper for continued support to the commission s work by highlighting the plight of the poor, weak and those suffering at the hands of land grabbers. The commission chairperson, Justice Catherine Bamugemereire and her team were received by Monitor Publications Managing Director, Mr Tony Glencross. This visit is to express our gratitude. The media has been a great champion of our work. You have highlighted the commission s work and provided awareness to the public. As the media you have championed the rights of the weak, the vulnerable and helpless persons by providing wide coverage to a wide range of injustices. We felt it important as we wind up to say thank you,  Justice Bamugemereire said. She said the commissioners and staff have been threatened by land grabbers and sought to know how Daily Monitor staff were coping in such circumstances. Justice Bamugemereire said the commission holds open hearings of land matters to allow transparency and public scrutiny and avoid underhand methods. She said in doing the commission work, she is under no illusion to replace the judiciary or the Ministry of Lands in their work. Mr Glencross thanked Justice Bamugemereire for the good work and pledged continued support to the commission. He confirmed that the media generally is under pressure but added that there are various ways of dealing with the problem including holding journalists to the highest level of integrity.  Integrity is what we do when nobody is seeing us. We ensure people report the truth and report it accurately,  Mr Glencross said. The Nation Media Group Editorial General Manager, Mr Daniel Kalinaki, noted that in such a challenging situation, the media finds refuge in the law.  Our biggest defence lies with public interest.

30,Fishermen strike enters fourth day - Daily Monitor,"Buvuma. Fishermen dealing in Nile Perch at landing sites in Buvuma, Buikwe and Kalangala districts have joined their counterparts in Masaka and Kyotera districts who indefinitely suspended fishing activities at the weekend.Although the fishermen in Masaka and Kyotera accuse their counterparts in Tanzania of flooding the Ugandan market with cheap fish, those in Buikwe, Buvuma and Kalangala protest the declining fish prices, generally.The most affected landing sites in Buikwe include; Kiyindi and Senyi where most of the fishermen sell their fish to processing and exporting companies.They claim that they incur a lot of expenses in the process of catching fish yet the profits are low.  We have decided to suspend fishing activities because we cannot afford making losses all the time. For example, it requires 20 litres of fuel to sail to areas in the lake where we catch Nile Perch of a recommended size, if one catches fish of 20 kilogrammes and sells each kilogramme at Shs4,500, he actually remains with nothing because there are other costs such as paying workers, taxes and other expenses,  Mr Fred Mubiru, the chairperson of Senyi Landing Site, said in an interview on Wednesday.He said the decision to park their boats was unanimously taken by all fishermen on Monday to allow government intervene in the matter. We know there is significant increase in fish stocks but that shouldn t be used to cheat the poor fishermen. If they [government] had not put a ban on dried fish, we could have preserved them and waited for the price to stabilize,  he said. An estimated seven tonnes of Nile Perch are said to be ferried out of Buvuma and Buikwe districts daily. Each fish truck leaving the landing site pays Shs60,000 as revenue for the district and another Shs20,000 which goes to government coffers.Mr Alex Kakooza, a fisherman at Lyabaana Sub-county, Buvuma District, who trades through Senyi Fishing Landing Site, castigated government for failing to set a standard price per kilogramme of Nile Perch which companies must follow. Everything we use in our fishing business has become expensive, from fishing nets to fuel, we pay taxes but it seems government is not bothered about our predicament,  he said.Mr James Kalemera, a fisherman at Kiyindi Landing Site, revealed that a kilogramme of Nile Perch was at Shs10,000 a year ago but has since dropped to Shs4,500. When they [government] brought new strict fishing regulations, we all agreed to follow them religiously and that is the reason there is plenty of fish now, but this shouldn t be used to throw us out of business,  he said.Mr Willy Lugoloobi , the Kalangala District chairperson, said they fully support the fishermen s strike because a drop in fish prices equally affects the district revenue. If they [fishermen] are not making profits, there is no way they can pay taxes. Their [fishermen] cause is genuine and we fully support them,  he said yesterday. He added that Kalangala District has 5,354 boats spread at 68 landing sites where they generate Shs600m as revenue annually.In Kalangala, fishermen pay Shs10,000 as landing fees and fish movement permits daily .The director of fisheries resources in the Ministry of Agriculture, Mr Edward Rukuunya, said government will soon address the issue. We are not seated as government, the minister has already forwarded their issues to Parliament and they will be addressed soon,  he said.Background Last October , Mr Sujal Goswami, the chairperson, Uganda Fish Processors and Exporters Association, said imports from other countries had overtaken Uganda s fish exports into Europe- a scenario that partly explains the drop in fish prices. The prices have been going down yet we cannot stop production but continue to sustain the market at a loss,  he said. Mr Goswami said the demand for fish is low and the European indigenous species are affecting Uganda s fish which was on high demand 15 years ago.Europe is Uganda s leading fish export market destination commanding over 80 per cent of the country s product.Due to bad fishing practices, fish stocks in Lake Victoria had drastically reduced and this in 2017 forced President Museveni to deploy soldiers under the Fisheries Protection unit on major landing sites. This has in the last couple of years seen fish stock especially Nile Perch significantly increase in size.

31,Why Karamoja depends on food aid - Daily Monitor,"Karamoja. The World Food Programme (WFP) last month supplied Super Cereal, a fortified blended food that is suspected to have been poisoned. Four people reportedly died in Amudat and Napak districts, Karamoja Sub-region.This occurrence provoked the intervention of Ministry of Health officials which issued a statement saying 262 people, who ate the porridge, developed mental confusion, high fever and abdominal pain within a week.Joint investigations into the possible contamination of the food that was distributed by WFP to prevent malnutrition in Karamoja Sub-region have since been instituted.The investigations are being conducted by WFP, police and the Ministry of Health.The WFP has since said it will engage Demirpolat Group, a Turkish company which supplied the food.Mr Ryan Anderson, the WFP deputy country director, says the company will be contacted by WFP officials in Rome, Italy, where the global food aid agency is based.Action planThe government in 2009 introduced the Karamoja Action Plan for Food Security, a five year project that was aimed at ensuring food security in the area. Leaders and locals explain that the sub-region continues to experience little rainfall that is inadequate for farming.Mr Simon Lokol, a resident of Lotome Village in Napak District, observes that they have experienced harsh weather conditions this year that have resulted in total crop failure. He said they experienced very heavy rainfall and later prolonged drought. While we thought the planting season was on, we rushed to open our gardens and planted crops which were affected by the heavy rains that caused flooding,  he says.Ms Betty Nangiro, a mother of three and a resident of Iriiri Sub-county in Napak District, appeals to the government to set up irrigation schemes to enable them irrigate their crops throughout the year. It is only through irrigation that we can become self-reliant. Short of that, we shall continue relying on food aid,  she says.Dodoth East MP Samson Lokeris says although the Karimojong have embraced farming, they have consistently been hit by drought. The unpredictable weather conditions have forced our people to continue depending on food aid,  he says.Mr Lokeris says most of the households survive on a single meal a day.Mr Lokeris, who doubles as chairperson of Karamoja parliamentary group, calls for government s urgent intervention to feed its people. If WFP gives out food, it should be supplementary from what government gives, otherwise the situation is very bad,  he says.Mr Mark Abuku, the Kaboong District chairperson, says more than 30,000 people in the district are starving. The situation is very bad if government delays to respond, people are going to die of hunger,  he says.Mr Joseph Lomonyang, the Napak District chairperson, says government should not wait to register deaths in order to act.Daily Monitor visited some families in Kaabong and discovered that most households survive on fruits.Ms Grace Nacuka, a mother of four in Sidok Village in Sidok Sub-county, Kaabong District, says government should come to their rescue as they only survive on wild bitter fruits. We do not know how the situation will be in the next one month if government does not respond and rescue us,  she says.The current situation in Karamoja has forced women in Napak and Amudat districts to turn down several calls from the district authorities and WFP to return the food suspected to have been poisoned.A total of 2,572 women in Napak and Amudat districts received porridge flour from WFP that turned to be poisonous but they have refused to return it on condition that the government must replace it first before they act.About KaramojaKaramoja is besieged by donor agencies dominated by WFP that have injected billions of shillings into the sub-region, although this has not prevented the area from continuous dependence on donor aid. The sub-region is in north eastern Uganda, an area that has always been hit by food and nutritional insecurities.It comprises several tribes, with majority being Karimojong. Others include Jie, Turkana, Dodoso, Nyakwai, Toposa and Nyangatom. Previously, their main source of livelihood was herding cattle due to their pastoral background, although they are slowly adapting to crop farming.Being semi-nomadic agro-pastoralists, Karimojong own large herds of livestock.The area experiences severe hunger despite the presence of fertile soils suitable for crop growing.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Why-Karamoja-depends-on-food-aid/688334-5055308-bsr9hy/index.html
32,Districts get Shs2b to fight Ebola - Daily Monitor,"Kisoro. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has launched a campaign to support the country s efforts in combating ebola in Kisoro, Kanungu, Rukungiri and Rubirizi districts.Mr Ali Abdi, the chief of mission-IOM Uganda, on Tuesday said they received a grant of $700,000 (about Shs2.6b) from United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund aimed at improving national preparedness and information management for the Ebola virus diseases surveillance at Ugandan entry points. This project comes in support to the Ministry of Health and its partners in efforts to keep the people of Uganda safe at the time when our neighbours in the DR Congo are battling the worst ever Ebola outbreak,  Mr Abdi said. In order to limit the spread of the disease, there is a lot we can do to strengthen our capacities to prevent, detect signs and symptoms and be prepared to contain a potential outbreak in our country,  he added.The officials will work in collaboration with other agencies such as World Health Organisation and United Nations International Children s Emergency Fund. The project will run for six months. Mr Abdi urged district monitoring teams to work together with the IOM teams to ensure that proper data collection on Ebola control is recorded.He said the lessons learnt in the process will make the national surveillance systems stronger, adding that volunteers and health workers that are being trained will be the future responders.Dr Allan Muruta, the assistant commissioner of Health Services in the National Disease Control, cautioned the public against hand shaking in order to prevent the spread of the disease.FearsThe Kisoro District health officer, Dr Steven Nsabiyumva, said the disease might spread to Uganda since Congolese do not want to pass through gazzetted border points. We have fears that ebola virus may cross into Uganda because some Congolese use ungazzeted border entry points when running away from the armed conflict in their country,  Dr Nsabiyumva said.The Resident District Commissioner, Mr Peter Mugisha, and his Kanungu counterpart, Mr Shaffique Ssekandi, pledged to support the fight against Ebola through security deployments to ensure that all Congolese pass through the gazetted routes.IOM said in a brief that although none of the nine previous Ebola outbreaks in DR Congo spread beyond an international boundary, the World Health Organisation has assessed the risk of the disease spreading to other countries as very high due to the proximity to urban centres and the fact that Rwanda and Uganda host and continue to receive Congolese refugees.BACKGROUNDIn November last year, the Ministry of Health asked people in districts neighbouring DR Congo to be alert and watch out for signs of the Ebola haemorrhagic fever, with some cases already registered only a few kilometres to the Uganda border. Since the Ebola outbreak in DR Congo early last year, the Health ministry has been receiving various alerts on symptoms similar to those of the haemorrhagic fever, but of the 300 suspected cases tested, none has turned out positive. The number of people killed in the Ebola outbreak in eastern DR Congo had risen to 443 by January, health authorities say.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Districts-get-Shs2b-fight-Ebola/688334-5055344-13fgehpz/index.html
33,Porous Uganda-South Sudan border cripples livestock farming - Daily Monitor,"Livestock farming in Lamwo District, northern Uganda is being hindered by cattle rustling at porous border points with South Sudan. The government has been restock ing animals following decades of long insurgencies instigated by the Lord s Resistance Army rebels.In 2014 for instance, the government through Peace Recovery and Development Plan programme earmarked Shs20 billion to restock the northern region.The programme was intended to help low income and poverty-stricken homes to improve their livelihood.However, in Lamwo, which borders South Sudan to the north, cattle rustling carried out by suspected armed South Sudanese rustlers have forced many farmers to abandon livestock farming. The areas mostly raided are Loremebenge, Goloro, Layamo, Central, Logede, Lopulingi and Ywaya villages, all in Agoro Sub-county and Lutuko, Orobo and Popany villages in Madi Opei Sub-county.Statistics Daily Monitor obtained from Lamwo leaders indicate a total of 254 goats and 100 cattle have so far been looted since February last year.Last week, nine animals in Layamokila Village, Ngacino Parish were looted by suspected South Sudanese cattle rustlers.Local leaders say the latest raid has sparked off fears of insecurity among farmers as the new farming season starts. Mr Denis Onyon, the Agoro Sub-county chairperson told Daily Monitor at the weekend that the rustlers are suspected to have crossed from Ikotos County in South Sudan. He said they were armed with guns, bows and arrows. We informed security personnel who followed the cattle rustlers, they are liaising with the Sudan People s Liberation Army at Loguru Detach in Geria County to follow up the suspects and recover the looted animals,  Mr Onyon said.Call to governmentMr Onyon said the constant invasion by rustlers has deprived livestock farmers  of a better livelihood. He noted the urgent need for government s intervention to address the border insecurity. The government should do its best to help farmers against the rustlers. All these things are happening because our border points are insecure,  Mr Onyon said.He further said:  These livestock looted help our farmers in various ways such as opening farmlands and paying school fees for children. Residents relocate Mr Geoffrey Mwaka, a livestock farmer from Agoro Sub-county, says he decided to relocate with his 20 animals to Lamwo Town Council which is safer. I was lucky last year when cattle rustlers attempted to raid my kraal, we made an alarm that attracted residents and security officials. Since then, I decided to relocate to Lamwo Town Council,  he said on Monday.He, however, says the pasture at the place he relocated are not nutritious hence affecting the growth of his animals.The Lamwo District chairperson, Mr Thomas Ogwok, said cattle rustlers have forced many people to relocate to safer areas thereby abandoning their farms. The livelihood of our people is greatly being affected by the constant rustling in the district. The farmers are living in fear because even at their farm or from home, the cattle rustlers attack them,  Mr Ogwok said.He also blamed the government for the laxity in ensuring the porous border points are well guarded. There used to be heavy deployment of the Anti -Stock Theft Unit personnel with the UPDF on the border points but they are now very few. These are the reasons why the rustlers are finding it easy to enter the district and attack locals,  he said.Mr Ogwok called on government to carry out an in-depth investigation on the cattle raided. Two people were shot dead last year in both Madi-opei and Agoro sub-counties by armed rustlersNusaf cattle stolenMr Isaac Lumago, the acting Lamwo District veterinary officer, said 50 of the cattle stolen were purchased under the Northern Uganda Social Action Fund (NUSAF) phase three last year.He said through coordination with security personnel in Uganda and South Sudan, 20 animals were recovered and handed back to the beneficiaries in the district.Lamwo received 555 cattle among them Ankole, Zebu short horned and improved bulls under the cattle restocking project. The governor of Imatong state in South Sudan, Mr Alberio Tobiolo, could not be reached for a comment as his known mobile phone number was switched off by press time.Beefing securityThe Lamwo Resident District Commissioner, Mr Nabinson Kidega, said they were in the process of adding more security personnel to beef up security at the border points. He said additional forces from the Local Defence Unit would be deployed to help the UPDF.Mr Julius Mucunguzi, the communication adviser in the Office of the Prime Minister, said it was unfortunate cattle meant to improve the livelihood of the locals are being looted by rustlers. It s quite unfortunate to hear this report and it must be addressed. We hope the district security team ensures the livelihood of the people are protected,  he said on Tuesday.Mr Julius Mucunguzi noted that he will cross check with the relevant authorities in the Office of the Prime Minister to find out whether the information of cattle rustling in Lamwo has reached their offices.The State minister for Northern Uganda, Ms Grace Freedom Kwiyucwiny, could not be reached for a comment on this report as she did not answer our repeated phone calls by press time.During the celebration to mark 38th Tarehe Sita in Kitgum District this year, President Museveni reiterated commitment to improve border security with South Sudan by deploying more security forces. Other insecurities  Local leaders have also raised complaints of border row at Ngomoromo in Lukung Sub-county where armed South Sudan soldiers invaded the area claiming it belongs to them. More than 20 homes have since fled the area. Another unresolved row involves a stretch of land in Agoro Sub-county measuring 120 kilometres. It s claimed by South Sudanese officials.  In April last year, heavily armed South Sudan soldiers forcefully halted a road survey in the area accusing Ugandan engineers of crossing into their territory and to date, the road works has stalled.[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Porous-Uganda-South-Sudan-border-cripples-livestock-farming/688334-5055468-11h63vs/index.html
34,Government limits fishermen to specific fish species - Daily Monitor,"Fishermen operating on Lake Victoria are being licenced to catch specific fish species, a move officials say aims at restoring some fish stock.The development was disclosed by the executive secretary of Lake Victoria Fisheries Organisation (LVFO), Dr Shigalla Bassanda Mahongo, during a recent meeting with the European Union ambassador to Uganda, Mr Attilio Pacifici.Dr Mahongo says a fisherman who has been licenced to catch Nile perch will not be allowed to cast their net into the waters in search for other species.He says this development has been agreed upon by all countries that share Lake Victoria. All the vessels in different countries will bear labels of specific fish species, country code and location,   he said, adding that the number of fishermen targeting high-value fish species has increased, which has led to a decline in stock. Licencing fishermen to catch specific species is an important management tool to prevent highly targeted fish species. The landings of highly valuable Nile perch declined by 34 per cent from 251,000 in 2014 to 165,000 tonnes in 2015, while the total fish landing from the lake for the period of 2011 to 2015 has been about one million tonnes,   he said.ImplementationThe director of fisheries management and development at LVFO, Dr Rhoda Tumwebaze, said the exercise has already kicked off and is being conducted by officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries.She noted that licencing fishermen to catch different fish species is one of the strategies of restoring the decreasing number of specific species in a lake. Nile perch is going down and other species are going up, if we realise that a certain type of fish is declining, we limit the number of people licenced for that particular type,   Dr Tumwebaze said.She said fishermen will be required to buy specific fishing gear for the species they have been licenced to fish. The director of National Fisheries Resources Research Institute (NAFIRRI), Dr Anthony Taabu Munyaho, said they will work with the local governments and the community in implementing these new fishing guidelines. Community involvement will ensure that everybody is compliant with the law. Those who will defy the law will have their licence revoked and dealt with accordingly,   he warned.Fishermen unhappyHowever, The chairperson of Masese Landing Site in Walukuba-Masese Division, Jinja District, Mr Godfrey Lumala, said they are unhappy with the move to licence fishermen to catch specific species, saying they were not consulted. They should have consulted us before coming up with such a law. It is unfair because some species such as silver fish are seasonal. That will require a fisherman to wait until the following season yet he is supposed to pay tax,  he said.Mr Najib Isabirye, a fisherman in Jinja, said:  Limiting us to specific fish species is unfair because even if we use the recommended nets, we can catch different species because some fishing gears catch different species.This development comes at a time when East African Community member states under LVFO have started registering fishermen and vessels on the lakes.STATISTICSStatistics from LVFO indicate the number of fish has increased by about 13 per cent from 194,000 in 2010 to 291,000 in 2016, while fishing vessels increased by 13 per cent from 64,600 in 2010 to around 73,000 in 2016. Statistics from NAFIRRI indicate that there are 50 fish species in Lake Victoria, including Nile perch locally known as empuuta and tilapia (engege).",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-limits-fishermen-to-specific-fish-species/688334-5053738-2rj9r1/index.html
35,15 buffaloes killed in Katakwi in last 4 months - Daily Monitor,"A total of 15 buffaloes have been killed in Katakwi District in just a period of four months, the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) has said.Mr Kizza Fredrick Kayanja, the UWA chief warden for Mt Elgon conservation area, said the buffaloes were part of the 500 of them found in Teso region.The buffaloes are believed to have escaped from Kidepo National Park in search of pasture and water and were wandering around Ongongoja and Usuk sub-counties in Katakwi. It is unfortunate our people in Katakwi have not learnt how to co-exist with wild animals and that s why they are poaching them,  Mr Kayanja said on Monday.He said in a period of three months, three people were also injured by the buffaloes, with two dying from inflicted injuries. The person who was recently killed by buffalo in Usuk, had at first killed the calf, then when he went for the mother, it charged and killed him,  Mr Kayanja said.WarningHe promised stringent action against people found killing the wild animals in order to deter others.Mr Kayanja said they are also working with the districts where the animals have settled. We intend to construct valley dams so that both wildlife and domestic animals have enough water,  Mr Kayanja said.He said there are also plans to have Katakwi benefit from sport hunting. Other districts have already benefited, including Nakapiripirit, Napak, Amudat and Kween.Mr Kayanja appealed to the districts and individuals to ensure the areas with wildlife are gazetted. He said they have already done aerial surveillance to ascertain the areas where the herds are.Previous invasionIn March 2017, residents of Katakwi and Amuria districts in Teso sub-region were invaded by buffaloes.The stray buffaloes forced the residents to stay indoors for fear that they would harm them and their children as they report to school.The buffaloes also destroyed crops.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/15-buffaloes-killed-in-Katakwi-in-last-4-months/688334-5053756-lmnulz/index.html
36,"Deny your spouses sex to save forests, women told - Daily Monitor","Amuru. Environmental activists have called on women in Amuru District to deny their husbands sex to compel them to stop the massive destruction of forests for commercial charcoal production.Under their umbrella body, Our Trees, We Need Answers, the activists argue that the only weapon left to save the forests in the district and the entire Acholi sub-region is women denying their spouses their conjugal rights, arguing that men are the catalysts in deforestation. Mr George Ovola, one of the activists, told women in Otorokome Village in Pabbo Sub-county, Amuru District, that they should play a big role in stopping environmental degradation. You should not wait until the last tree is cut down to make charcoal before you act. Kindly save the trees that have not yet been cut down by commercial dealers,  Mr Ovola said.He noted that if women can deny their husbands sex for just a week, there will be a change.However, Ms Mary Auma, a resident, noted that most trees have already been cut down and there is nothing to save. It is late to do anything since there is nothing more to save even if we deny our men their conjugal rights,  Mr Auma said.Powerful loggersShe said some commercial charcoal dealers are very rich and that in some cases, they lure married women in the area into sex.Ms Molly Achen, another resident, said men do not care anymore about sex. Men here care only about alcohol packed in sachets. If the (government) can stop sachets, that is what will concern them not trees that they have not planted,  she added. A local charcoal dealer in area, who preferred anonymity, said nothing will stop him from cutting down trees.  With the biting poverty, I am forced to rely on the forest for survival due to lack of economic opportunities at the moment,  he said.However, Mr Geoffrey Osborne Oceng, an activist, urged the women not to give up.  After you have had a miscarriage, you don t give up on having children in the future. So, I urge you (women) to do anything to save trees,  he said.He explained that with change in rainfall patterns caused by environmental degradation, families will not be able to grow enough food to sustain their livelihoods.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Deny-your-spouses-sex-to-save-forests-women-told-/688334-5053784-7bfvo/index.html

38,"800 eye, dental patients receive free treatment - Daily Monitor","About 800 patients with dental and sight illnesses have been treated for free.Patients received treatment during a one-day health camp organised by the newly created chartered Lions Club of Bwambara in Rukungiri District at Bikurungu Health Centre 111 on Saturday.According to organisers, the objective was to give back to the community.The President of the Lions Club of Bwambara, Mr Jotham Tugumisirize, in the company of other members of the club from Kampala and those within Rukungiri, lined up a team of dentists and ophthalmologists from Mulago hospital led by Dr Grace Ssali to attend to hundreds of patients. We are grateful to the North India Cultural Association that sponsored this health camp in which about Shs40 million was used to facilitate the exercise. We were able to purchase drugs and other medical equipment that was used,  said Mr Tugumisirize.He was flanked by the Monitor Publications manager-in-charge of circulation, Mr Justus Katungi, on the eve of the health camp. Mr Tugumisirize said their team distributed sanitary towels to about 300 girls of Bwambara Secondary School besides giving career guidance to all the students in the same school.The official-in-charge of Bikurungu Health centre 11, Mr Godfrey Tucungwirwe, said the facility registers about 20 cases of patients with sight and dental illnesses but they are usually referred to Nyakibale Hospital in Rukungiri Town about 30 kms away because they do not have specialised personnel to handle them.Mr Tucungwirwe said there is need for government to fund a research programme to generate a report on the increased cases of such complications and also come up with solutions.  We appeal to the government for increased funding for health education because the current Shs200,000 allocated to health education is too little to handle hundreds of patients that visit our facility per quarter. If we can get about Shs4m per year for health education, this dental problem will be solved,  he said.The Lions Club members promised to organise more health camps to help the needy.Mr Tugumisirize said his facility registers about 1,500 out-patients and about 45 pregnant women per month and some of them come from the neighbouring districts of Kanungu and Mitooma adding that drugs from National Medical Stores worth Shs3.7m per quarter is not enough. He said other common diseases in the area include malaria, cough, skin diseases, and diarrhoea among other diseases related to harsh climatic conditions.The mayor for Bikurungu Town Council, Mr Arthur Tugume, applauded the Lions Club of Bwambara for their generosity and called on other well-wishers to supplement government efforts of delivering quality health services.Background Cause.

39,Algeria set for new protests despite Bouteflika departure - Daily Monitor,"Algerians are planning mass protests Friday in a key test of whether they can keep up the pressure for sweeping reforms following ailing president Abdelaziz Bouteflika's resignation.Opponents of the old regime have taken to social media calling for a massive turnout, targeting a triumvirate they dub the ""3B"" -- Abdelakder Bensalah, Tayeb Belaiz and Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui.The Bouteflika regime stalwarts have been entrusted to oversee the political transition after the veteran leader finally stepped down at the age of 82.Bouteflika quit late Tuesday after weeks of demonstrations against his bid for a fifth term in office. He had lost the backing of key loyalists including armed forces chief Ahmed Gaid Salah.Bensalah, speaker of the upper house of parliament for 16 years, is to take the reins as interim president for three months until elections are organised.Belaiz, a minister for 16 years, was named by Bouteflika as head of the Constitutional Council which regulates elections.Bedoui, until his appointment as prime minister, had served as interior minister -- or, as the French-language El Watan newspaper put it on Thursday, ""chief engineer of electoral fraud"". Critics say all three have always been faithful Bouteflika servants, who should follow his lead and resign.Lawyer Mustapha Bouchachi, one of the leading voices of the protest movement, urged Algerians to continue protesting ""until they have all gone"".""Our victory is partial,"" he said in a video posted online. ""Algerians will not accept that symbols of the regime... lead the interim period and organise the next elections.""""These symbols of the regime cannot be part of the solution and we have been demanding since February 22 that the whole system, its symbols and its clients, leave,"" he added. ""The president's resignation does not mean that we have actually won.""'Delicate phase' Protesters are calling for transitional institutions to be set up to implement reforms and guarantee free elections.Hamza Meddeb, an independent analyst in Tunisia, said Algeria was entering ""a very delicate phase, because the street and the institutions are at risk of diverging"".He said the only winner of this tussle would be Bouteflika and his entourage.But Geneva-based political scientist Hasni Abidi said ""the Algerian street has become has become a new player"" in the country's politics.Little was known, however, about the army's intentions, he said.Algerian newspapers have also focused on the role of the military in the transition period.The French daily Le Soir d'Algerie asked how the armed forces would react in the event of continuing protests.It asked: ""will the military institution put all its weight into imposing strict compliance with the constitution... or push for another consensual political outcome """"How to use the transition,"" read a headline in El Watan, next to a drawing of General Gaid Salah, with a whistle in his mouth, leading protesters down a path dubbed ""constitutional order"".Despite abandoning Bouteflika, the army chief is still seen among protesters as one of the key members of the ""system"" after the president appointed him to the post in 2004.Liberte, another newspaper, said many Algerians saw Gaid Salah as having backed Bouteflika almost to the end, ""even endorsing the option of a fifth term, and only broke away after the street scuttled him.""""After the Bouteflika clan, it will be the turn of the armed forces chief to face the street,"" it said.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Algeria-set-new-protests-despite-Bouteflika-departure/688340-5057576-4by1o8/index.html
40,"In Rwanda, the long, slow journey to forgiveness - Daily Monitor","Their embrace is long and warm. Pascal Shyirahwamaboko and Jean-Bosco Gakwenzire have known each other since they were in school together, well over half a century ago.It was a hard-won hug after a long path to forgiveness.In 1994, Shyirahwamaboko was part of the gang who hacked Gakwenzire's father to death as Rwanda spiralled into the horrific violence of genocide.Today the two men chat with brotherly smiles after prayers in their local church.Both are elderly farmers, who till the lush fields of cassava, sorghum and sweet potatoes outside the small town of Mutete, 40 kilometres (25 miles) north of Rwanda's capital Kigali.""I hurt him so much, but he forgave me,"" says Shyirahwamaboko, 68. ""Now he is my best friend.""'Wild animals'Twenty-five years ago this April, the town of Mutete was the scene of unimaginable violence, when neighbour turned on neighbour.More than a thousand residents of the town were massacred in the days following the outbreak of inter-ethnic violence, a genocide in which over 800,000 mostly Tutsi people were slaughtered between April to July 1994, according to the UN.Gakwenzire, a slender 65-year-old dressed in an orange cowboy hat, remembers the arrival of the teams of machete-wielding men, members of a militia gang from the Hutu majority known as the ""Interahamwe"".They came to hunt down and kill Tutsi people they called ""cockroaches.""""They went to each and every house that they knew had Tutsis,"" Gakwenzire said wearily, his eyes filled with sadness as he remembers the traumatic events. ""They were cutting them with machetes.""Gakwenzire managed to hide from the killers. But his wife and four of his six children were discovered by the gangs. They were all massacred.His father fled to the forest with his cattle but an Interahamwe gang -- which Shyirahwamboko said he had been forced to join -- found him there.Shyirahwamaboko said he at first tried to protect his friend's father.But the militia gave him a stark choice, he said, either he give up the man to be killed, or be killed himself.""I saved myself,"" he said quietly, and later he took part in the killing of several others.After the genocide, Shyirahwamaboko was arrested and put on trial in a community court known as ""Gacaca"", a special system introduced to deal with the overwhelming number of people who had to face justice.As a means of promoting reconciliation, many who confessed to even the most terrible crimes were condemned only to carry out simple public works.But Shyirahwamaboko, at first, refused to confess his crimes, so he was handed a much harsher sentence.""It was hard,"" he said, adding that he envied those who came forward immediately to confess what they had done. ""I was confused. How could I explain to people that I had killed someone who was innocent ""For a long time, he did not believe he could ever be forgiven.""At first, we thought it was impossible, because we committed acts worthy of wild animals,"" Shyirahwamaboko added, but after a long introspection ""we came to understand that it could not continue as it was.""'An unspeakable shame'Things changed. While Shyirahwamaboko was inside jail, he heard that people in the village were still treating his wife Rose with respect, despite the crimes he had committed. In the end, he summoned the courage and asked for forgiveness from his old classmate. When he was released from prison, he came to meet Gakwenzire face-to-face.""It was an unspeakable shame,"" Shyirahwamaboko said. ""It was very shameful to stand in front of someone you had done so much harm when you had previously shared everything.""Confessing in public helped reset their relationship. ""I do not know if it is because I have become wiser with age, but the reality is that I feel better than before,"" said Shyirahwamaboko.Gakwenzire slowly found space in his heart to accept that his old friend was truly sorry for what he had done.""I did not feel able to speak or share anything with those responsible for what had happened,"" Gakwenzire said.""But with time, with prayer, little by little, we began to forgive, to speak of forgiveness and to teach it.""After the genocide, Gakwenzire took a long time to rebuild. He eventually remarried and has had five more children.""I forgave many people, who are all my neighbours. I know that those who are dead will never come back, that what we have lost will never come back.

41,Key dates in Rwanda's genocide and its aftermath - Daily Monitor,"Over 100 days in Rwanda in 1994, about 800,000 people, mainly Tutsis, were slaughtered in a mass campaign of ethnic violence. Here is a timeline. President killedOn April 6, 1994, Rwanda's president Juvenal Habyarimana, from the Hutu majority, is killed when his aircraft is shot down over Kigali.He was on his way back from peace talks in Tanzania with Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who had been waging an insurgency since 1990.Genocide startsThe very next day, soldiers kill the moderate Hutu prime minister, as well as 10 Belgian paratroopers guarding her and other top officials in the Hutu-dominated coalition government.The genocide begins. Lists of those to be killed -- mostly Tutsis but also opposition Hutus -- are distributed.Soldiers and Hutu militiamen set up roadblocks and launch a house-to-house search for their targets.The Mille Collines radio station spouts anti-Tutsi propaganda, referring to them as ""cockroaches"". Officials and media outlets incite people to kill, loot and rape.Men, women and children are killed with machetes, grenades and bullets.UN scales down effortOn April 9, French and Belgian paratroopers start arriving to evacuate their nationals.By April 18, the Red Cross says tens of thousands of people, perhaps hundreds of thousands, have died.A UN peacekeeping operation, unable to stop the massacres, is reduced on April 21 from about 2,500 to 270 men.A week later, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says a ""genocide"" is under way.On June 22, France deploys Operation Turquoise, a UN-mandated force tasked with halting the killing. It has little effect.On June 30, the UN Human Rights Commission's special rapporteur says the slaughter legally qualifies as ""genocide"" and appears to have been planned.Slaughter stopsOn July 4, soldiers of the mainly Tutsi RPF seize the capital Kigali. The 100 days of killings ends. Hundreds of thousands of Hutus, fearing reprisals, flee to neighbouring Zaire, today's Democratic Republic of Congo.International courtIn November 1994, the UN creates the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to try the main perpetrators in neighbouring Tanzania.In May 1998, Jean Kambanda, who was prime minister during the killings, pleads guilty to genocide and crimes against humanity. He is the first to admit responsiblity.In September 1998, the court becomes the first international tribunal to hand down a conviction for genocide, finding a former town mayor guilty of inciting the massacre of more than 2,000 Tutsis.The court goes on to sentence several dozen people, including some to life in jail. It closes in 2015.Local courtsFrom March 2005, community-run courts called ""gacaca"" begin trials for people suspected of participating in the genocide. Nearly two million people are brought before 12,000 courts, with 65 percent convicted. The courts close in 2012.Trials are also held in Belgium and France.Rwanda presidentRPF leader Paul Kagame is chosen to be president in April 2000, following the resignation of Pasteur Bizimungu, a Hutu who had served in the post since July 1994.Kagame remains in power today.In November 2006, a French judge recommends his prosecution by the UN-backed tribunal for suspected participation in the 1994 killing of President Habyarimana.

Boeing is reviewing the report.The Ethiopian Airlines flight was headed to Nairobi on a clear morning on March 10 when it plummeted nose-first into a field outside Addis Ababa just minutes after take-off, having reportedly experienced erratic steep climbs and descents.Citizens from over 30 countries were on board.Similarities quickly emerged between the crash and that of an Indonesian Lion Air 737 MAX 8 flight in October last year which killed 189 people.Scrutiny has centred on an anti-stall system, developed specifically for the latest versions of the planes, that has given pilots problems.MCASDagmawit did not make specific reference to the automatic anti-stalling system, but did mention a ""repetitive nose-down"" movement of the aircraft.The Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) is designed to automatically lower the aircraft's nose if it detects a stall or loss of airspeed.Boeing issued a bulletin reminding operators of emergency guidelines to override the anti-stall system after the Lion Air crash.The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that pilots had shut off the anti-stall system, but switched it back on because they could not regain control, citing people briefed on the preliminary findings.Dagmawit did not give details of what happened in the cockpit during the fateful final minutes of the flight, but said takeoff ""appeared very normal"" and that all the crew had the requisite qualifications to operate the jet.The head of the accident investigation bureau Amdiye Ayalew said the full probe would take six months to a year, but that there had been no sign of ""foreign object damage"" to the aircraft.""Within this one year we'll analyse whether other problems are existing on this aircraft,"" he said.The head of Ethiopian Airlines Tewolde GebreMariam said he was proud of the efforts of the pilots in trying to stop their jet from crashing.'PROUD'""We are very proud of our pilots' compliances to follow the emergency procedures, and high level of professional performances in such extremely difficult situations,"" he said in a statement.Meanwhile Boeing, seeking to win back public confidence in the planes, on Wednesday released photographs of its chief executive, who joined a test flight of a 737 MAX with the company's updated anti-stall system.changes -- including the system no longer repeatedly making corrections when pilots try to regain control.The company is anxious to win approval for a remedy that could get the planes back in the air.But the FAA, which faced harsh questioning last week at a congressional hearing regarding its oversight of Boeing, said it expected the plane maker to submit the proposed fix ""over the coming weeks"" after it undertakes additional work.The FAA said Monday that Boeing needed to undertake more work on the proposed fix before it could be submitted for review.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Crew-of-Ethiopian-plane-followed-Boeing-procedures-minister-/688340-5057568-dwd266/index.html
43,Algeria's Bouteflika resigns after weeks of protests - Daily Monitor,"Algeria's ailing leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika submitted his resignation with immediate effect, state media said Tuesday, ceding power in the face of massive street protests after two decades at the helm.Car horns sounded on the streets before crowds of flag-waving people emerged from their homes and converged in the centre of the capital Algiers to celebrate.Bouteflika ""officially advised the Constitutional Council of the end of his term of office as President of the Republic"", state television reported.""I have the honour to formally notify you of my decision to terminate my term of office as President of the Republic from today, Tuesday,"" state news agency APS quoted his resignation letter as saying.""This decision which I take in my soul and conscience is destined to contribute to the appeasement of the hearts and minds of my compatriots, to allow them to take Algeria towards a better future to which they legitimately aspire,"" it added.Footage showed Bouteflika, dressed in a beige gandoura (North African tunic) and sitting in his wheelchair, handing his resignation letter to the head of the Constitutional Council, Tayeb Belaiz.Street celebrations Long accused of clinging to power, the veteran leader faced mounting pressure to step down after his decision to seek a fifth term despite rarely being seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013.The 82-year-old said last month he would pull out of the bid for another term, and on Monday his office said he would resign before his mandate expires at the end of the month.The moves failed to satisfy protesters who feared a ploy to extend his rule and the armed forces chief called for him to leave power. The announcement of his resignation sparked jubilation in the capital.Youths cheered and waved the Algerian national flag at Grande Post square, the epicentre of the protest against his rule in downtown Algiers, an AFP cameraman reported from the scene.The United States said the future of Algeria was now up to its people.""Questions about how to navigate this transition in Algeria, that is for the Algerian people to decide,"" State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Bouteflika's decision to step down marked the turning of ""an important page in the history of Algeria"".""We are confident in the ability of all Algerians to continue this democratic transition in the same spirit of calm and responsibility"" that has prevailed in recent weeks, Le Drian added in a statement.Algeria's constitution says that once the president officially resigns the speaker of the upper house of parliament, 77-year-old Abdelkader Bensalah, acts as interim leader for up to 90 days during which a presidential election must be organised.The resignation came shortly after the military demanded impeachment proceedings be launched against Bouteflika, responding to Monday's announcement that the president would resign by the end of his term on April 28.Armed forces chief Ahmed Gaid Salah had called for ""the immediate application of the constitutional procedure for removing the head of state from power"", in a defence ministry statement after a meeting of top brass.Without naming anyone, Gaid Salah criticised ""the stubbornness, the procrastination and the deviousness of certain individuals who are trying to make the crisis last and make it more complex with the only concern being their narrow personal interests"".He said the army's ""sole ambition"" was to ""protect the people from a handful of (other) people who have unduly taken over the wealth of the Algerian people"".A long-time Bouteflika ally, the general last week called on the president to resign or be declared unfit to rule, becoming one of the first of his faithful supporters to abandon him.Rumours swirl As rumours have swirled of frantic behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, prosecutors on Monday announced they had banned corruption suspects from leaving Algeria after launching graft probes against unnamed individuals.The authorities did not say who was being targeted by probes into corruption and illegal money transfers abroad, but they followed the arrest of the president's key backer, businessman tycoon Ali Haddad.Haddad, who Forbes magazine describes as one of Algeria's wealthiest entrepreneurs, was detained at the weekend at a border post with neighbouring Tunisia.Bouteflika had named a new government on Sunday, made up mainly of technocrats under recently appointed premier Noureddine Bedoui.The administration -- supposed to steer the country towards transition -- included General Gaid Salah remaining in his position as deputy defence minister.Among the other key Bouteflika backers is his younger brother and special adviser Said, who was frequently cited in the past as a likely successor to the president.Discreet and rarely seen in public, Said Bouteflika has exerted increasing influence behind the scenes as his brother's health worsened, but the president's resignation could take away much of his power.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Algeria-Bouteflika-resigns-after-weeks-protests/688340-5054002-wq39hbz/index.html
44,Libya in chaos since 2011 overthrow of Gadhafi - Daily Monitor,"Libya has been mired in chaos since the ouster and killing of dictator Muamer Gadhafi in 2011, with two rival authorities and a multitude of militias vying for control of the oil-rich country.Strongman Khalifa Haftar's forces were pushed back Friday from a key checkpoint less than 30 kilometres (18 miles) from Tripoli, checking their lightning advance on the capital, seat of the country's internationally recognised unity government.Haftar supports a parallel administration based in the east.Here is a timeline of the Mediterranean country's descent into turmoil: Kadhafi killed Triggered by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, demonstrations erupt in Libya in February 2011. A coalition led by Washington, Paris and London lends its backing to an armed revolt. Gadhafi, in power for 42 years, flees the capital. He is captured and killed on October 20, 2011 during a battle for his hometown Sirte, east of Tripoli.Three days later, the rebel National Transitional Council (NTC) declares Libya's ""total liberation"".In August 2012 the NTC hands power to a transitional authority elected a month earlier -- the General National Congress (GNC). Embassies targeted US ambassador Chris Stevens and three American staff are killed in a September 11, 2012 attack on their consulate in Libya's second city Benghazi. An Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group is blamed.A car bomb in April 2013 targets France's embassy in Tripoli, wounding two French guards.Most foreign delegations withdraw from the country.Rival governmentsDissident army general Haftar launches an offensive in May 2014 against jihadist groups in Benghazi. He is backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Several military officers from the east join his self-styled Libyan National Army.As nationalists and Islamists vie for power, legislative elections are held in June and the GNC is replaced by a parliament dominated by anti-Islamists.Islamist-led militias contest the results and group under the banner of ""Fajr Libya"" (Libya Dawn). They storm Tripoli in August, installing their own ""national salvation"" government and restoring the GNC.The elected house, which has international recognition, takes refuge in the eastern city of Tobruk near the border with Egypt.Thus the country finds itself with two governments and two parliaments.After months of negotiations and international pressure, lawmakers from the rival parliaments sign an accord in December 2015 in Morocco to set up a UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA).In March 2016, GNA chief Fayez al-Sarraj arrives in Tripoli to set up the new government, but Haftar's rival administration refuses to recognise its authority.Peace talks, armed groups In July 2017, Sarraj and Haftar meet for talks near Paris where they agree to a ceasefire and commit to elections the following year.In May 2018, weeks after suicide attackers from the Islamic State group kill 14 people at Libya's electoral commission, the two men meet again in the French capital and commit to holding parliamentary and presidential polls at the end of the year.In June 2018, a militia attacks two northeastern oil sites under Haftar's control through which oil is exported.After days of fighting, Haftar's forces announce they are back in ""full control"" and have also seized the city of Derna from radical Islamists.In January 2019 Haftar launches an offensive into oil-rich southern Libya, ostensibly aimed at wiping out ""terrorists"" and criminal groups. His forces seize the region's capital Sebha and one of the country's main oil fields without a fight. Conferences On February 28 the UN says Libya's rivals have met and agreed to hold polls.In March the UN says it will organise an all-party conference the next month to draw up a ""road map"" for Libya, including setting dates for legislative and presidential elections.Later in March the African Union says it will host a ""reconciliation"" conference in July aimed at uniting Libya's political rivals.Advance on TripoliOn Wednesday, Haftar's forces announce they are gearing up to move on the west of the country including Tripoli.A day later powerful armed groups from the western city of Misrata, loyal to the Tripoli government, vow to block the threatened advance.UN chief Antonio Guterres expresses deep concern over the risk of a major flare-up in Libya.Haftar orders his troops to advance on Tripoli, saying ""the time has come"".The strongman's forces seize a key security barrier within 27 kilometres of the capital later that day without any fighting, General Abdessalem al-Hassi says.But on Friday, a security source says militiamen from the nearby coastal town of Zawiya retake the base after ""a short exchange of fire"".",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/Libya-2011-overthrow-Gadhafi-Mediterranean-Tunisia/688340-5058520-gayfr1z/index.html
45,"A quarter-century later, Rwanda's genocide weighs heavily on its youth - Daily Monitor","Every April 7, Rwanda recalls the hundreds of thousands of people who perished in the 1994 genocide -- an occasion that for many survivors triggers terrifying memories.But for the two-thirds of the population born in the aftermath of the slaughter, the trauma is of a different kind.They face burdens of their own, having grown up in the shadow of unspeakable atrocities while carrying the crushing weight of expectations of a brighter future.""For us, people who grew up after the events, one would tend to think that it doesn't affect us directly,"" said Bruce Muringira, aged 24.""But I would say it does... it takes a toll on us too.""Muringira works for an advertising agency in Rwanda's capital Kigali.He was born a year after the mass killings, in which Hutu extremists and soldiers mainly targeted the Tutsi minority for three months.""It is a painful memory, and for a lot of families, they have found the best way to cope is to try and put it in the past,"" said Muringira.""But it's not an easy thing to do. So every April, when it comes, you see people changing. You see people withdrawing into themselves more and more.""Young people feel the absence of those they never even knew; grandparents, even their own parents. The gaps in family are constant reminders of those who were lost.Trauma lingers in the succeeding generation as well. Youths speak of their responsibility to ensure that the horrors of 1994 will never happen again.National unity Learning about his family history was painful, said Muringira. ""I went through a lot of moments of insecurity, confusion and questioning,"" he said.It is a feeling echoed by others.Jean-Paul Haguma, now 26, was a one-year-old baby when the killing began. He does not want to talk about the details of what happened to his family.""It is a difficult time,"" Haguma said. ""But it is the history. It happened, it became part of our life.""Many of the young regret that the image of Rwanda abroad today is still all too often only that of the story of the genocide.Supporters of the government praise the advances Rwanda has made in term of peace and reconciliation, and speak of its economic success.Young people echo the rhetoric of Rwanda's tough government in supporting development for the small, densely populated nation of hills.""The youth should support the development... to implement, with all our energy and will, the government programmes,"" said Diane Mushimiyimana, a 23-year-old student.Those who grew up after the genocide were taught the core concept of Rwandan unity, and how splits between the different groups paved the way for the massacres of at least 800,000 people.'Part of our history' ""My dream for Rwanda is, first and foremost, to be able to move past what happened,"" said Muringira.""I'm not talking about forgetting it, because when you forget your own history, there's a risk of repeating it...My hope is that we might be able to see ourselves, more than anything, as Rwandans - not as one tribe or another, not as victims or perpetrators.""Emmanuel Habumugisha was born in May 1994, in the middle of the genocide. His father was killed.From the pain and loss, he hopes there is a lesson for the future. There is a benefit in reading the history of Rwanda's genocide, and of other countries that have seen such suffering, he said.""Then they will know the value of a person, know how to relate to each other,"" Habumugisha said. ""Then they will come together to help each other to develop - instead of fighting.""Every person deals with the legacy of genocide in their own way. Some try to remember. Others do everything to forget.Some, like Muringira, see the act of remembrance as a way to build a more positive future.""As much as we were not there, it is part of our history too. It is a defining feature of who we are as a country - but also who we are as individuals,"" Muringira said.""Those of us who understand that, we are trying our best to make our communities and our country a better place.""",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/World/A-quarter-century-later-Rwanda-genocide-weighs-heavily-its-youth/688340-5057572-flsdry/index.html
46,"Networking, easy way of growing career - Daily Monitor","For your career to take off, you will need the help of people who will avail opportunities, know-how and connections. Just like a popular quote by American businessman and media magnate Sumner Redstone states:  If you never venture beyond what you know... You have spawned your own limitations.  To grow your professional relationships, start with the people you already know; your family and friends who will eventually introduce you to their family and friends, which will continuously expand your networking circle to a level that is satisfactory to you. Although networking might be difficult for naturally introverted people, they must make an effort to go out and meet new people because that is one way in which careers and businesses are built. TV personality, fashion designer and host of the popular Kwivuga Poetry Sessions, Nunu Umuringa Butare s career is an embodiment of the power of networking. As a social entrepreneur, her business depends on the good will of as many people as possible.  I was lucky to realise that one cannot grow or succeed in a vacuum so I set out to meet as many people as possible and make meaningful connections. I attend every event I am invited to, offer help whenever I am called upon, and treat every connection with as much respect as possible,  she says. Breaking barriersNetworks have the power to break barriers and establish the most unlikely relationships. Edwin Musiime, the NTV Property Show presenter, says he has entered the House of Lords, accessed the United States White House relying on the power of networks.  I always say that our networks determine our net worth. The power of networking has enabled me attain high levels of leverage across all spheres of influence. The Bible says iron sharpens iron; people make you a better, wiser and stronger person  Musiime reveals. Networks also help influence decision, avail mentors, life coaches and role models that are very essential for both business and career growth. As Musiime says, we are always five people away from the person we want to meet the most in the universe; someone you know might know someone who knows someone else, who knows that person you believe has the power to change your life forever.  One of my role models and personal mentor is Vusi Thembekwayo who is regarded as the world s youngest and most impressive public speaker and I met him through my vast connections. I can testify that meeting him changed my life in all ways; financially, emotionally and spiritually,  adds Musiime.Nourish relationshipsLike all relationships in life, networks need to be cultivated and nurtured or they die off. Public relations specialist Muhereza Kyamutetera avers that networks need reciprocity and integrity to flourish.  In life, we all look for relationships that benefit us either financially, emotionally or intellectually. We, therefore, seek to make connections with people that are likely to fulfill those desires. Likewise, people are drawn to us because of what they think we can do for them. So meeting these expectations is important,  Kyamutetera opines. He further recommends treating every individual relationship with the utmost importance and respect. Join an associationMost professions have an association or union that brings people together. Wilson Kutegeka, the chief executive officer of ClinicMaster, is a member of the Information and Communications Technology Association of Uganda (ICTAU).  I have benefited through connections with international organisations such as the Netherlands Trust Fund which helped develop ClinicMaster to suit international standards thus getting us clients from all over the East Africa region. This would have been a very expensive and strenuous task had I undertaken it on my own,  Kutegeka shares.

47,Learning Vs cramming: What are students taking home  - Daily Monitor,"When Prof A.B. K. Kasozi, the former National Council for Higher Education (NCHE) executive director, proposed that the current seven-year primary education be adjusted to eight, and that students transition to university after completing O-Level, scrapping off what he termed as the  unnecessary two years  of A-Level, the mixed reactions that ensued were no surprise at all. Proposals such as Prof Kasozi s, are increasingly getting more popular. Just after the release of Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE) this year for example, social media was awash with debate on relevance of such standardised examinations, with some people suggesting a total removal of PLE. However, decrying a wanting education system dates as far back as after independence from colonial rule by most African countries. African scholars set out to contribute to Africanisation of the education system and some of their suggestions were quite radical. For example, Unwuachi in 1972 favoured a complete departure from the colonial systems as cited by Dr Connie Nshemereirwe in her 2017 research paper,  What was my education for  Transformative education and the Africa we want by 2030 . Unwuachi noted that,  Black cultural objectives can never be obtained using white European standardised educational processes. Kenya s 8-4-4 system And whereas Kenya s 8-4-4 education system can be applauded for the high numbers of students in higher education compared to Uganda s (a gross enrolment ratio of 500,000 to 250,000 respectively), according to Prof Kasozi s article in the New Vision, there is one important issue it does not answer   the quality of education. As a matter of fact, over the years, Kenyans have challenged their government to overhaul the 8-4-4 system of education. In February, 2016 for example, a forum organised at Nairobi s iHub tapped into an active social media audience on Twitter and created the hashtag #CurriculumReformsKE to speak about the education of the country. Many expressed dissatisfactions with the current system, arguing that it was steeped in rote learning -basically memorising of useless facts for passing in exams, according to Tuko.co.ke.One @MartieMtange noted on Twitter that,  We need to restore the position of thinking in learning. Not just people who take in information but those who build on it.  @Linyonyism also noted,  The cost of not reforming our education system is too high. We need to start acting now. Last year, Kenya s education ministry sought to change their system and replace it with the 2-6-3-3 system. Though, led by former Moi University vice chancellor Laban Ayiro, the review discouraged the government from pushing through with the new changes. However, the report by the review team as reported in The Standard newspaper barely answers the question of quality.Whether with Kenya s 8-4-4 system or our own 7-4-2-3, there is currently a growing feeling that something is wrong with our system of education. But what is it  Are our students actually learning, beyond just enrolling into school According to Robert Bulega, a Senior Five student of Makerere College School, poor teacher renumeration and poor school facilities are the main hindrances to effective learning. He reasons,  When the teacher feels that their services are not valued, then they will not give their best, but also, learning does not take place in a vacuum. We need good facilities and equipment, which are lacking in many schools. However, Ssebweze Kyeswa, a member of Kigo Thinkers, a network of academicians, sees a more significant problem; the lack of clear national standards for all schools.  A number of schools are preoccupied with good performance in examinations than learning; lessons are mostly based on  past exams  papers. It would be premature to start worrying about the environment and teacher quality before setting the standards for the country s education system,  he writes in Dr Nshemereirwe s paper,  Creating a thinking person: The need for higher order skills in the Ugandan education system . Schooling killing learningAdditionally, Dr Lawrence Muganga, a public policy and strategy advisor, notes that our school system is wanting in many ways.  We educate children by batches and govern their lives by ringing bells. All day long, students do nothing but follow instructions. In today s world, how far can you get by simply following instructions   he wonders, adding that the modern world values people who can be creative, yet students do not get a chance to develop such skills in the current system. Dr Nshemereirwe also points to the  banking  system, which she says, is the main mode of teaching today. Here, the teacher is all knowing, and the students perceived as empty vessels.   It tells learners both the questions to be asked and the answers thereof. The banking system consequently produces individuals who gradually take on the habit of looking to others in order to find out what is what, under the belief that they have nothing of value to say,  the paper reads in part. For Muganga most of the learning that happens in schools today is not authentic because it relies on memorisation and rote learning.  We know that such learning is not authentic because most of it is gone after the exam. Learning can be much deeper and more authentic, especially when students get involved and contribute in their own learning. Limited room for talentPaulo Freire, in his book; Pedagogy of the Oppressed stresses that as human beings, our main job is to become fully human   each one of us growing into our own unique versions by discovering our passions and talents. But who in school asks or even cares about your dreams and passions  The question is always, who do you want to be like; the doctor, teacher, lawyer, among other professions. How many students will read Chemistry and Physics but when all they want to do is sing, or be with computers   Janet Namulindwa, a teacher from Lubiri Secondary School, asks. To her, this one-size-fits-all kind of education that kills intuition, initiative, passions and creativity needs to be changed.  This could be one of the reasons we have a low retention as formal education progresses because parents and students realise this is not working in terms of encouraging their passions. School dropouts join business, music, drama, vocational and technical schools in form of apprenticeship because they find these more realistic to their life s needs,  Namulindwa adds. According to her, there should therefore be room in the current education system for the most important questions in a child s life. What am I good at  What do I want to do in life  How do I fit into this world  And, then the education should be flexible enough to offer those different children the solutions.Privatisation This cutthroat, unhealthy competition we see in schools, and the encouragement of unnecessary competition amongst children other than learning from one another is slowly killing us. These private schools, with no control, charge exorbitant amounts of money to give our children first grades,  Grace, a parent at Victorious Primary School, says. She confesses that many parents live in worry about school fees and fees increments, and the long list of requirements which have made the cost of education so high. Grace, therefore, calls upon government for more control on education fees charged by private education providers. Currently, 27 per cent of schools at primary level are privately-owned and 66 per cent of schools at secondary level are private. As of 2013, enrollment in private schools was at 16.2 per cent at primary level and 51.0 per cent at secondary level according to the Privatisation, Discrimination and the Right to Education in Uganda Alternative Report of June 2015.High stake examinations While examining how schooling is killing learning, it came out strongly that the major cause of rote learning isthe high-stake examinations.  It is like life begins and ends with those examinations, and if you do not pass, you are doomed, which is not right,  a parent argued. The recent education report, Facing forward: Schooling for learning in Africa 2018) by the World Bank, noted that,  High-stake examinations are a bottleneck to progression. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa continue to have high-stake selection examinations that filter children for the next level of education. This creates perverse incentives for teachers to  teach to the test  and leads to unnecessary grade repetition,  the report reads in part. However, countries that have eliminated examinations between the primary and lower secondary levels have shown significant increase in lower secondary enrolments and improvements in basic education completion, the report noted.Financing Very often, the issue of financing our education, has come up. According to the Education and Sports Sector Annual Performance Report Financial Year 2016/17 Subsector Allocation, primary education takes the lion s share of the budget with a 50.17 per cent allocation, followed by tertiary with 19.61 per cent allocation. Secondary education with a 15.20 per cent, business, technical and vocational education and training at 10.55 per cent and others such as physical education, sports with 4.47 per cent of the total Shs2,447.88 billion budget.  So, does it come as a surprise that we have high numbers of pupils enrolling for primary education and yet the numbers dwindle in lower secondary, sharply falling at higher secondary and university   Mathias Mugumya, an education enthusiast, asks. To Dr Muganga, we not only need to fix a few things in the education sector but rather a fundamental change that includes the issues raised earlier.  If we want to prepare our children for the modern world and want learning to be effective, then we need to fundamentally change our system of education,  he says.Performance at different levelsThe education system has also been in the spotlight for student s dwindling performance. In the Education and Sports Sector Annual Performance Report financial year 2016/17 for example, Literacy rate at Primary Three was at 60.2 per cent and 51.9 per cent at Primary Six. Numeracy rate at Primary Three was 71.7 per cent and 52.6 per cent at Primary Six. Primary Leaving Examinations pass rate was at 86 per cent in 2015/16 and 86.9 per cent in 2016/17. The pass rate at O-Level was at 87 per cent whereas the Performance Index was at 39 per cent. Performance Index at Advanced Level was 64 per cent. Editor's thoughts Many educationists think there is something wrong with our education system. In fact as you will find out in the cover article, different people, students inclusive, feel that our education system needs an overhaul. Some argue that this should start with improving teachers  salaries yet others say, there Education ministry needs to set standards of operation and follow them up. But in trying to do all this, we must remember that learning goes beyond the classroom. This will help us to stop promoting more of exams than we do actual learning.How many schools for instance encourage students to come up with educational projects  In most Ugandan schools today, there is little or nothing at all being done to encourage innovation. All that students are encouraged to do is read notes and pass examinations. In doing this, schools are churning out students that seem geniuses but cannot think outside the box. Such students, as the future will tell, may not be able to solve simple life challenges when they face them. Therefore, to promote holistic learning, our schools should encourage innovation and creative thinking than cramming.Peninah Asiimwe[email protected]",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Learning-cramming-What-are-students-taking-home-education/688336-5050716-uco0huz/index.html

49, Teach despite the meagre pay  - Moses Bisaso - Daily Monitor,"Moses Bisaso could have been a lawyer in the best case scenario but he could have also been a school dropout at worst had his friend, Gerald Bisaso, not intervened after the former s Senior Six. Gerald, who was a student at Makerere University at the time was doing school practice at Najja Mary s High School Kiyindi, Buikwe District, where Moses was teaching too. And that confirmed the fact that Bisaso was destined to be a teacher because Gerald said he would pay for his university education on condition that he enrolls for an education degree.It is 8am when I reach Kiteza Senior Secondary School in Buikwe District where Bisaso, the head teacher is preparing lessons for his next class at 11am in his office. Despite being the head teacher, Bisaso teaches Christian Religious Education and Luganda in all the candidate classes.Asked about how he balances administration work and teaching, he says he is driven by passion.  I had wanted to be a lawyer at first but now I do not see any other profession that would give me as much satisfaction as teaching does,  he says.Born to Fred Sserwanga and Florence Nanyonjo of Luwero District in 1985, Bisaso was orphaned at one year and grew up in Lugazi Town with his grandmother, a peasant.Schooling against oddsBisaso spent the seven years of primary school at St Kizito Primary School in Lugazi and scored Aggregate 9 in 1998.In 1999, he joined Equator College, Lugazi until 2002 when he sat for Uganda Certificate of Education and scored Aggregate 29. To afford school fees, Bisaso says he used to do casual work which of course would affect his education. Unlike other students, Bisaso never had free time even during holidays for maximum concentration on his books. Instead he would be doing pottery work and bricklaying to earn some money for home and his school requirements. After Senior Four he thought the end of his education had come since the school director had only sponsored him up to that level. But in 2003, his grandmother secured another scholarship at Central View High School, Mukono for only Senior Five to study HED/Luganda which he would supplement with casual work. Luck was on his side and his sponsorship was extended because he was a disciplined student. He scored 19 points in Ugandan Advanced Certificate of Education in 2004.But his peasant grandmother could not pay for his university education so for a year he was not in school. During his vacation, Bisaso had been asked to teach Senior One in Najja Mary s High School Kiyindi, Buikwe District by Kiluta Ssemisambwa, the head of the school. Impressed by the performance of the students, Ssemisambwa promised to enroll Bisaso for university education but Bisaso met Gerald before the promise came to pass.Ray of hopeIn 2006, Bisaso enrolled for a Bachelor s degree in Education at Makerere University and graduated in 2009.After his degree he got a job to teach at Good Will College, Kampala from where he joined Omega Christian High School, Mukono. In 2012 he joined Mutesa Memorial School then St. Mary s Orthodox School as deputy head in 2013. In mid-2013, he was also a part-time teacher in Kiteza but later quit the Orthodox school to become a full teacher at Kiteza where he was later appointed headmaster.Bisaso says they mostly sponsor orphaned students at the school where he goes an extra mile to interact and counsel them to make them fit in the society. The director Ssalongo Mukasa Mutyaba brings street and orphaned children who study for free but can help in farm work during weekends.  I always encourage the other students not to segregate them,  he says.To those joining the teaching profession, Bisaso advises them to love and stick to it. He says others join teaching as a last resort, but at whatever stage they decide, they should not regret. Let them be satisfied so as to yield good results. He also says meagre salaries should not let them fail at their work but instead, they should impart knowledge as required to make a great future for the young generation.

50,Time to think what next after A-Level - Daily Monitor,"Whereas many students work hard to get points that will see them enrol for their dream courses, the final decision to get admitted lies with the institution. Isaac Tugume, a third year Civil Engineering student at Kyambogo University had wanted to be a civil engineer since his childhood. At A-Level, he studied Physics, Economics and Mathematics. After his results, he applied to both Makerere and Kyambogo for the same course. Whereas he preferred Makerere, only Kyambogo had offered him the course. Makerere had given him Mechanical Engineering which he ditched. As the current applicants get ready to start the search, they should know there are a number of options to choose from and should not be limited to the big names. Public universities The country currently has nine public universities which include: Makerere, Kyambogo, Busitema, Kumi, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Gulu, Kabale, Muni and Lira universities. Most students apply to join any of them on government sponsorship at Senior Six. However, as you wait, you need to prepare yourself to know whether you might be among the lucky ones.The points to get you admitted on government admission are a bit higher than those for private sponsorship.For instance, for one to qualify for a civil engineering course at Makerere University, they need at least 51 points using the weighting system. Using the weighting system, both O-Level and A-Level results are considered. For O-Level, distinctions 1 and 2 weigh 0.3 points. Credits 3 to 6 weigh 0.2 points and F.9 carries 0.0 point. To get a total of the weight at O-Level, multiply the number of distinctions/credits/passes by their respective weights. For instance, if one scored 10 distinctions at O  level, it will be 10x 0.3= (3). For A-Level, subjects are classified as Essential, Relevant and Desirable depending on the course a student is applying for. For instance, if a student scored AAA11 in PEM, the student will qualify for an engineering course at university with a consideration of Physics and Mathematics as the Essential subjects as Economics is a Relevant subject. Essential subjects are mainly considered and weigh higher. For instance, Physics and Mathematics will carry 3 points each. Economics weighs 2 points as a relevant subject. ICT and General Paper are Desirables weighing 1 point each. The weights are multiplied by the Principal or Subsidiary pass. So, for a student with AAA11 in PEM; (Physics= 6x3= 18, Mathematics= 6x3=18, Economics=6x2=12.) General Paper and ICT carry 1 point each. (18+18+12+1+1= 50.) A-Level =50, O-Level =3. Add both A and O level points to get the total. 50+3= 53 points. This is a sample calculation basing on last year s cut off points for a student interested in Civil Engineering at Makerere University.According to UACE results released this year, there were more students who had passed with two or three principal passes compared to last year. This, therefore, shows that cutoff points might go high. Private universities If you do not get admitted to a public university, remember that currently, there are 37 private universities in the country. Both public and private universities follow the National Council of Higher Education (NCHE) policy of two principal passes and one subsidiary at A-Level to admit students depending on course preference. But different private universities have different admission criteria. Christa Oluka, the director of Admissions and Students records at Uganda Christian University (UCU), Mukono, says the university looks beyond the two principal passes while admitting students, especially for degree courses. Oluka says for courses such as Law and Medicine, a student has to sit for pre-entry exams and score a 50 per cent mark to get admission. Muhammed Sumare is the Academic Registrar at Islamic University in Uganda (IUIU). He says,  We require two principal passes and one subsidiary. For example, if one is interested in medicine, the two principal passes should be in Chemistry and Biology. For business-related courses, a student should have a background of Economics and Entrepreneurship,  he says. Upcountry study centresUniversities have also established upcountry campuses to cater for the needs of students in other districts. These branches are established in regional centres such as Arua, Mbale, Hoima, Mbarara, Jinja, Kabale, Gulu, and Fort Portal Town. Other universities have established affiliations with mainly private tertiary institutions. Universities also provide diploma courses for those with one principal pass in essential subjects.It is also important that a student considers his interests such as hobbies, culture, sports, religion before enrolling for a given course in a university for a fulfilling university life.Business/technical collegesThese are governed under the Uganda Business and Technical Examinations Board. Today, at least five government technical colleges offer diploma and certificate in engineering courses. Such courses include; plumbing, civil engineering and architecture among others. Jacob Akunobere, the principal at Uganda Technical College, Kyema in Masindi district, says they also follow the statutory requirements to admit students. Consideration is given to Physics, Mathematics, and Technical Drawing as Essentials. Other subjects such as Economics are relevant for one to join any government technical college for a diploma after A  level. A minimum of one principal pass in an essential subject and two subsidiaries are considered. However, Akunobere says one should have scored at least credits in sciences, Maths and English at O-Level for a certificate courses.Government Business colleges under Uganda College of Commerce are currently five in number and offer both diploma and certificate courses. But one must have a background in Economics, Entreprenuership, Mathematics and Accounts. A number of private institutions have sprung throughout the country. Some purely offer technical courses while others offer business related courses.Meanwhile, others have incorporated both technical and business aspects. For instance, Royal Institute of Business and Technical Education is one such institution located in Bwaise. One of the administrators says they are strict on admission. He says for one to qualify for any business related course, he or she must have a background in Economics, Entrepreneurship and Mathematics. And a good performance in Commerce and Accounts at O-Level. Some private colleges have humanities  courses such as teaching, guidance and counselling, social work and social administration as well as social sciences. Specialised tertiary institutions Apart from business and technical colleges, there are other colleges specialised in training students in a particular field offering mainly diploma and certificate courses in Education, Law, Aviation, Medicine, Tourism, Forestry, Agriculture, Media, Theology and Management. Such institutions are strict on admission criteria.For instance, to be eligible for direct entry in diploma or certificate in a nursing programme at Mulago School of Nursing and Midwifery, a candidate must have credits in English, Biology, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. At A-Level a principal pass in Biology and two subsidiaries in Chemistry, Physics, Food and Nutrition as well as Mathematics. At Bukalasa Agricultural Institute, for anyone interested in a Diploma in Animal Husbandry, Crop Production, Human Nutrition, and Horticulture, they should have scored a principal pass in Biology or Chemistry which are considered essentials.For an Agribusiness course at the college, Agriculture and Entrepreneurship are essential. For a certificate in the same courses, a student should have scored credits in sciences in addition to Mathematics and English at O-Level.For students interested in joining teaching colleges such as primary teaching college, you are required to have a minimum of credits in all the subjects at O-Level. Law Development Centre offers courses in Law. For a Diploma in Law, one is required to have at least one principal pass and two subsidiaries. From nursing, engineering to law, a student should be strategic in the choice of university or tertiary institution if they are to pursue a dream course.One should also have at least two other alternatives if the first one fails. Also cast the nets wider by applying to three or four institutions.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Education/Time-to-think-what-next-after-A-Level--/688336-5040182-r9fecn/index.html
51,"I do not regret becoming a teacher, despite poor pay - Daily Monitor","Teachers complain about little pay and in fact this has discouraged a number of people from joining the profession. Not for Joviah Nyakwera. The teacher is proud of her choice of profession. Nyakwera describes her 12-year experience in teaching as an amazing journey, which she would love to end only on retirement. A number of teachers are in the profession but do not like their work. I am grateful for what I am. Through teaching I have been exposed to people from different walks of life and I have been able to influence their lives positively,  she says. Born to Yofesi Ndoleriire of Rubona Bunyangabu, Nyakwera says she was inspired to join the profession by her parents who were both teachers.She recalls being taught while at home something she attributes her love for teaching to.  I always spare time to revise with my children. This helps me discover their strengths but also weaknesses in learning,  she says.Nyakwera joined school in 1989 at Rubona Primary School and after completing Primary Seven, she joined Kahinju Secondary School in Fort Portal for O-Level.While at Kahinju, she was drawn further to teaching after seeing the commitment and selfless attitude that her teachers displayed. My teachers were a great inspiration. Some would even sacrifice their leisure time just to give us extra lessons on hard concepts which we would not have grasped during lessons,  she says adding that this selfless attitude is what has made some teachers influential people.In 2000, Nyakwera joined Progressive Secondary School, Wandegeya for A-Level with History, Economics, Geography and Divinity as her subject combination.She later enrolled for a Bachelors of Arts in Education at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. This was a dream come true considering she was enrolling for a course that she had longed to pursue.In 2004, after her graduation, Nyakwera started her teaching journey at Kaboyo Secondary School in Kabarole District. She was not employed on fulltime basis but it did not stop her from doing her job well.  I used to wake up early in the morning and be at school on time regardless of the little pay I was getting,  she recalls. In all this, her joy was seeing her students excel and move on to the next level. Diversifying She was at Kaboyo until 2010 when she was transferred to Kibiito Senior Secondary School to teach History and Divinity in Senior Four and Senior Six.She wanted to diversify. And so she applied to become an examiner for Senior Four History at Uneb in 2009. This is a decision Nyakwera does not regret. She says becoming an examiner has helped her learn many ideas thus helping her get more students to pass her subject.  I have learnt how they mark at Uneb and what they consider during marking,  she notes. In 2012, Nyakwera was transferred to Nyarukoma Secondary School in Kyenjonjo District as a teacher on government payroll. She was there for two years until the administration of Kibiito Secondary School asked for her services again. In 2014, she returned to Kibiito Secondary School but alongside teaching, she became the senior woman. This, she says, made her realise that students have several issues that teachers need to address so that they are nurtured and attain a holistic education. Students have so many issues that affect their daily lives. They range from physical, social to physiological. If not addressed, it becomes hard for the students to perform well. Important to note is that as teachers, we have a big role to play in these student s lives since we spend a lot of time with them, compared to their parents,  she explains.Growing careerNyakwera is now the deputy head teacher in charge of general duties at the school. Despite teaching the candidate classes, she spares time to interact with the students and through this, she finds out the major challenges that are affecting students and finds possible ways to solve them. To get expertise on this, Nyakwera has enrolled for a Masters in Counselling Psychology at Uganda Martyrs University, Nkozi. To her, a good teacher is supposed to provide counselling and guidance to the students.Asked about some of the challenges affecting the teaching profession, Nyakwera says the greatest is teachers who join the profession as the last option, as well as businessmen who open schools and have led to unhealthy competition among schools. These business people are not interested in the kind of students their school churns out. They are only interested in instant results so as to attract more numbers in their schools. This has led to high level of malpractices in schools,  she observes.Nyakwera says for a teacher to excel in teaching, they need to be selfless, patient, hardworking and committed. And athough the salary may not be that much, she say there is nothing as gratifying as a teacher seeing their students excelling in future.Voices Nyakwera is a teacher that is very determined to get results. She is good at engaging parents so as to make sure that her students get help both at home and at school. Gwendolyn Kanyomozi, teacher She is self-driven and patient with her students. She is also a good counsellor who always engages students to make sure they are on the right track. Moses Rubalema, lecturer, Mountains of the Moon University She is strict and does not tolerate laziness. But it is her being strict that has modelled me into what I am today. She does not want to see any of her students fail.

52,Ensure you enrol for a course you won t regret - Daily Monitor,"In 2016, Makerere University students protested the institution s decision to scrap 32 courses. The affected students complained that the decision would affect their chances at gainful employment in the competitive job market. Commenting on the institution s decision, Prof John Ddumba Ssentamu, the vice chancellor of Makerere University then, said some of the courses were merged, dropped totally or restructured to give holistic training to students. He added that students must understand that curriculums are always reviewed. And while Makerere was restructuring courses, in Mukono at Uganda Christian University, some new courses were being introduced. According to Ivan Naijuka, the university spokesperson at the time, the decision to review their curriculum to include new courses was because the institution aims at giving their graduates a competitive advantage in the job market.  The need to train professionals who are whole in the sense of knowledge, integrity as well as stewardship directed the institution s decision to include new courses,  he said. But with the various changes in courses of study at our institutions, what should inform one s choice  PassionSolomon Eriatu, a former student at Kampala International University, says he had always been passionate about journalism and when it was time for him to join university, he could not look any further than a course which would offer him the much desired training. And so Eriatu enrolled for Mass Communication.  I am an extrovert and sociable person and basing on those character traits and my passion for news reporting, I decided to join journalism class. My role models are all media people and I had been practising how to write stories since primary school.  Similarly, Judith Akwelele enrolled for a Bachelors in Child Development because of her love for children.  I could not have opted for any other course as my passion for children in unrivalled. And contrary to popular belief, I had high grades that are synonymous with those who enrol for courses such as Law. At least I felt happier than my colleagues doing Law because they were influenced by their parents,  she says. InspirationOften times, students envision a conducive and favourable working environment ready to embrace them after university through the eyes of their role models. Sean Rukundo, a graduate of Procurement and Logistics, currently a CIPS student at Uganda Management Institute, says he was inspired to study procurement and logistics because of his father s success.  Having seen my father move through the ranks in a government ministry s department of procurement, I was inspired to pursue the same course. I envisioned a job market in favour of procurement officers. Unfortunately, times are dynamic and I have not been able to find a stable,  narrates Rukundo. Money factorDespite her passion for Law, 43-year-old Mary Ouma, enrolled for Bachelor of Arts in Education because she was getting government sponsorship on the latter at Makerere University.  The high tuition fees for law school left me with no option but to venture into teaching. Fortunately, I have grown to love the profession. And luckily the job market is very favourable for my kind even with the changing times,  she says. GradesAlthough some are driven by passion, others are forced to choose certain courses by their scores in national examinations. For instance Martin Kaganzi s dream of joining journalism class still remains a dream.  I was given Public Administration at Kyambogo University as my 14 points at UACE could not allow for Journalism,  he shares. Some students opt for certain courses after getting intimidated out of the ones they have been admitted to. Most universities give students a window of two weeks to if they are to switch. Akwelele reveals that some of her peers joined Child Development course because they thought it would be easier for them to pass and be free from retaking papers. Similarly Sheila Alupot, a third year student of Nkumba University switched from Mass Communication to Bachelors of Social Work and Social Administration after feeling overwhelmed.  The multiple theories and numerous fieldwork assignments in the Journalism class scared me,  she says. According to Doreen Metta, a lecturer at St Lawrence University, students need to get career guidance.  Students who receive career guidance are well equipped with the knowledge of which courses to study.  Metta encourages both teachers and parents to be involved in providing the rightful career guidance to their children so that by the time they get to university, they are sure of what they want to pursue.  Parents should be involved in exposing their children to different materials and practices that will help them make their choices. Understand your child s interest in say; medicine, and allowing them to interface with medical persons as well as be exposed to hospital environments,  she advises.WHAT THE STUDENTS SAY I enrolled for a Journalism course because I had always admired being a presenter either on television or radio but because I encountered a lot of challenges getting into that field, I got demotivated and now I just write.  Kezia Koburungi, Mass Communication student KIU We live in a world of technology and innovations.

54,Macron names experts to probe French action during Rwanda genocide - Daily Monitor,"French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday appointed a panel of experts to investigate France's actions in Rwanda during the country's genocide 25 years ago, a subject that has dogged Franco-Rwandan relations since the 1994 massacres.The commission of eight researchers and historians ""will be tasked with consulting all France's archives relating to the genocide... in order to analyse the role and engagement of France during that period,"" the presidency said in a statement.The commission will look at the period from 1990 to 1994 to ""contribute to a better understanding and knowledge of the genocide of Tutsis,"" the statement said.The findings will be used in material used to teach people in France about the genocide, it added.Rwanda has accused France of being complicit in the genocide of an estimated 800,000 mostly ethnic Tutsis through its support for the Hutu-led government of the day.It also accuses the French forces who were stationed in Rwanda under a UN mandate of having helped some of the perpetrators to escape, with some seeking sanctuary in France.Paris has consistently denied complicity in the bloodletting, which has cast a long shadow over Franco-Rwandan relations, leading Rwanda at one point to break off ties for three years.Relations have improved in the past decade.But Macron caused disappointment among genocide survivors by turning down an invitation to attend this weekend's genocide commemorations in Rwanda.",https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Macron-names-experts-probe-French-action-Rwanda-genocide/688334-5058300-ah3cihz/index.html
